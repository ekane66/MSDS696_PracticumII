Full Video Explanation Of The Recommended Routine For /r/BodyweightFitness,Antranik,12968,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5ls6to/full_video_explanation_of_the_recommended_routine/,1483453856.0,"It's finally here! A video that explains our Recommended Routine from start to finish so that *anybody* could understand it and feel comfortable to start working out with confidence!

#Video: https://youtu.be/AB3HhP2GYk0

Why? What is the Recommended Routine?

* People come to /r/bodyweightfitness looking for a good routine to without the need to go to a gym and we often refer them to our very own [Recommended Routine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) This is a free, full-body, strength-training routine which has helped countless people build muscle, lose fat and gain new physical abilities.

* We know full well that it can be overwhelming to read it all, *especially* if one is new to working out in general. So to help make it easier, I've created this video that explains the overall structure of the routine, including how progressions work and all the progressions/details so that you could understand everything in just a few minutes!

This was definitely one of my more ambitious video editing projects (with the [yoga video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3nldsg/after_months_of_editing_i_am_happy_to_share_with/) being more) but it was a joy to make, especially with all the cameo experiences of my doggie Medax. I hope you like it!

**Edit #1:** I just [x-posted it to /r/videos!](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5lse8g/explanation_of_the_rbodyweightfitness_recommended/)  Hopefully they will find it helpful as well. :)

**Edit #2:** I am actually kind of overwhelmed with the massive response. This went viral (peaked at #2 on /r/videos for 5 hours, which is insane..ly cool! And #2 on /r/fitness currently). My inbox is flooded and I'm going to do my best to answer peoples questions eventually (maybe), but if you want to help answer other peoples questions, please do that for me. Not everybody understands the joy of bwf (and maybe don't understand that we're not all bodybuilders) and that we have different kinds of movement oriented goals that maybe some of you can help explain in case there are misconceptions in the /r/videos discussion.

A 15 minutes bodyweight routine for posture and strength imbalances correction - No equipment required,Leo-HolisticStrength,7323,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a09852/a_15_minutes_bodyweight_routine_for_posture_and/,1543159025.0,"# Introduction

Sitting in a chair in front of a computer for several hours on a daily basis has a negative impact on posture and on strength.

Some common postural issues are forward head posture, rounded shoulders, winged scapula and anterior pelvic tilt. It also causes many strength issues. For instance it is very common for the average Joe to have wrist pain by just doing Push-Ups or to be unable to do full ROM bodyweight Rows.

At the end, sitting for a long period of time on a daily basis has a negative impact on joint health, performance and aesthetics. The goods news is that the issues very concisely described can be prevented and corrected.

Here, a focus will be made on posture/strength imbalances **correction**. Prevention will not be mentioned (changing posture every 20 minutes and stuff like that). A routine will be proposed for posture/strength imbalanced correction and the purpose of each exercise will be explained. This is a routine that I have been using for several months with great results.

Disclaimer: I am NOT a doctor in exercise science, a physio or anything like that. If you think that an exercise may not be suitable for you, **don't do it** and talk with your physio about it if necessary.

# Impact of sitting on the body chains

When sitting, almost all the joints are flexed. The consequences are usually the following:

* Tight **anterior** chain - Flexor muscles: neck flexors, anterior delt, chest, abs, hip flexors, quadriceps...
* Weak **posterior** chain - Extensor muscles: neck extensors, posterior delt, back, gluteus maximus, hamstrings...
* Weak **lateral** chain (this one is very often forgotten) - Abductor, adductor and rotator muscles: neck rotators, lateral delt, obliques, quadratus lomborum and plenty other deep muscles in the back, gluteus medius/minimus...

This is what the proposed routine will tackle.

# The routine

The routine is divided in two main parts:

* Part I: joints circumduction/circle - To warm-up and wake-up the joints (\~5 min)
* Part II: strengthening the weak muscles and stretching the tight muscles (\~10 min)
   * ^(My personal favorite exercise is the Seal stretch) [^(https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GymnasticBodies-Stretch.png)](https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GymnasticBodies-Stretch.png)

**The routine can be performed on a daily basis.** It does not require any equipment (edit: excepted for the Passive Hang). **It is up to you to remove some exercises if you think that it is necessary when you also have a planned training session. This routine is not supposed to be hard, this is not a standard training session.**

I am aware that a visual document with pictures or a video would be better along with form tips. Also, this is a 15 minutes routine so obviously it cannot cover everything.

Your suggestions are welcome:

* Any exercise you like or do not like?
* Any additional exercise you would recommend?
* What is your personal experience with corrective routines? Did you manage to improve your posture over time?

A bodyweight training skill tree i made with over 200 exercises,KNightNox,6878,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/pawj7l/a_bodyweight_training_skill_tree_i_made_with_over/,1629839827.0,"Hello bodyweightfitness!

After Training on and off for the last few years i finally got fed up with having to research progression everytime an exercise became too easy for my routine which has led me to create this skill tree that compiles a wide array of resistance training, plyometrics, isometrics, yoga poses, movement and martial arts to create progressions from beginner to elite for most major muscle groups.

I made this for personal use and thus prioritized the design and clarity above perfect placement of the nodes. Since i have no fitness or science experience in this field there are bound to be lots of errors in where the exercises are placed and the targeted muscle groups are often inconsistent within their branches. However i think this graphic does a good job of showing what is available and how you can get to some of the elite exercises, like for example the planche or the handstand push up. I'd be glad to hear any feedback!

I hope this is useful to some of the people in this subreddit. And if you can use it, please research the exercises yourself and be sure to maintain proper form.

With that out of the way, here it is: [Skill Tree](https://imgur.com/GpE6uDN)

"If you can't do more than 5-6 pull-ups, please rest for longer periods between sets if you want to increase that number.",noNSFWcontent,6157,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fh2qek/if_you_cant_do_more_than_56_pullups_please_rest/,1583954732.0,"I've seen a lot of people trying to learn how to do pull-ups make this mistake. 

If you can do just 1-2 pull-ups it is a strength exercise that you're doing. The same as a 1 RPM deadlift or squat. You need to give your body time to recover. That's why people who train strength rest for at least 4 minutes before doing another set. 

So take your time, walk around, do some other exercise in between but don't treat pull-ups as just any other regular exercise if it is still a strength exercise according to your body."

Can we PLEASE stop giving teenagers dietary advice?,berrieunfunnie,5054,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ls8x0u/can_we_please_stop_giving_teenagers_dietary_advice/,1614266506.0,"I know this isn't normally within the discussions allowed on this sub, but I really feel this needs to be said.

I love this sub. I love the community and the fantastic advice that is given here. I love seeing people weigh in and help out beginners right the up to the very advanced who are getting stuck. 

The only problem I have with this sub is how we respond to teenagers. Can we please stop recommending they cut calories for the following reasons:

- they are growing and their calorific needs are different from yours
- their hormones are all over the place which can have huge effects on water and fat retention. 
- they are at a higher risk of developing eating disorders
- they most likely have little to no control over what meals they eat, outside of choosing not to eat.
- their days are possibly (non-covid times) very regimented with very strict school schedules of when they can and cannot eat. (I'm not saying this is right, but it definitely will influence *what, how much* and *when* they will eat)

I am a teacher and the amount of full untouched lunches I see being disposed of after lunch is crazy. There is a worrying amount of kids not eating breakfast in the mornings. The worst part about all of this is society has us trained to look for these behaviours in teenage girls, but the boys are also avoiding/skipping meals at much (if not more often) from what I can see, and it seems (to me) to be based on ill-advised fitness trends.

I have spoken to students of mine who have gotten intermittent fasting advice from Reddit and no longer eat until after the school day is completed. The reason I have found this out is because they were falling asleep in all of my classes. 

I know this advice is coming from a good place, but we need to realise teenagers don't always take the advice with a pinch of salt, and often take it to far more extremes than you would imagine. Many don't have the skills to research things themselves yet or make the best decisions for themselves. Many still believe that adults know it all, and they *trust* us. We need to be careful about what we say to them, and what guidance we give. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and good luck with your own training & goals.

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: I just wanted to add, there are some amazing responses to this in the comments (both those who agree and disagree). And many of you are right, there is also some fantastic dietary advice given. My concern was the over-simplified ""cut calories"" that often assume the person in question knows what a balanced diet is to begin with. Thanks again for being such a great community, and responding so thoroughly!

Edit 3: I just wanted to say that the response to this is overwhelming. Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond. I've tried to read every comment and respond where I could. There are so many people here who are working hard in the comments sections posting good and reliable information. Thank you all

Many have pointed out some flaws in my anecdotes, such as there is a range of reasons why students might also through classes, not just diets and that US school lunches aren't the most nutritious or tasty (something I genuinely didn't think about as I'm not from the US), but I hope the rest of my point still stands, even without that aspect."
Coronavirus Curfew Home Workout - 12 min session! No Equipment Required - Scalable for all strength/ age/ability levels. Excel in isolation! All you need to SMASH your lockdown workout !,MarcusBondi,4793,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fjyhyo/coronavirus_curfew_home_workout_12_min_session_no/,1584416618.0,"Hey all you r/bodyweightfitness superstars looking to SMASH through the COVID19 lockdown! Out of tragedy comes EXTREME STRENGTH AND MUSCLE POWER AND FITNESS - with this crazy-easy program I have devised for everyone who wants to shred and burn and crank and SUCCEED!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE!!! \*\*\*Here's the YOUTUBE link to a simple demonstration of all the exercises [https://youtu.be/PED7GgHpsgo](https://youtu.be/PED7GgHpsgo)GO FOR IT!!!!\*\*\*    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

OK - This program is directly scalable to your strength and cardio ability and will evolve and become harder as you become stronger and are able to complete more sets. As a total body workout, it can be done in virtually any park or backyard in your home town or even in a car park. But it’s a very intense 12 minutes (minimum), so you need to have a water bottle handy.

This body weight training circuit hits every major muscle group and will build hard, dense, strong and fast muscle fibres.

\*\*\*Each exercise is performed to maximum reps until failure or a duration of 60 seconds; whichever comes first. Rest for a maximum of 60 seconds between exercises; there are 7 exercises with 60 seconds rest in between equalling a total of 12 minutes from the start of your first exercise to the end of your last exercise. This is geared to shred your frame of fat and build hard muscle. ***If you still have energy and strength to do more exercises after completing the 7 exercises, then start the circuit again and do as many exercises as possible.*** 

Half or partial range-of-motion reps are allowed if you have exhausted your full R.O.M strength within the 60 seconds– just try to get to that 60 seconds of muscle movement. 

**1. Push Ups - for 60 seconds**

Get into push up position, straighten your arms with hands under your shoulders. Keep your hands in this position as you bang out max rep push ups while pointing your elbows BACK with each full-range downward motion. Keep your arms 'close' to your body - do not flare out your elbows. Try to keep legs straight wth knees and ankles together! Breathe deeply, *in* through your nose and *out* through your mouth. *If you tire, proceed to partial reps to complete the 60 second time duration.* 

Rest 60 seconds

**2. Double leg squat jumps -for 60 seconds**

For these, stand with feet shoulder-width apart with toes pointed slightly outwards. Bend at the knees, lower your butt down and then jump as high as you can, almost straighten legs and then land smoothly, bending at the knee, using it as a ‘shock-absorber’. Use explosive plyo-metrics to launch your butt high into the air; reach up with both hands to maximum altitude. Land back down to earth as smoothly as possible using both legs as steel-spring shock absorbers. Go the full 60 seconds, even if you finish by doing pathetic little micro-squats. It’s all part of the process; you will become stronger! Rest 60 seconds then move on to the next exercise.

Rest 60 seconds

**3. Push-through crunches - for 60 seconds**Find a flat surface, get on your back, bend knees, feet flat, point arms forward then raise your back and shoulders - curl at the core/abs - and push your hands through the gap between your knees.Keep your neck tucked in to your chest. Exhale as much air out of your lungs as possible; take short sharp breaths, exhaling on the contracting/up movement. Use your abs to lift your back/shoulders. Aim for as many rets of ten that you can do in 60 seconds.

Rest 60 seconds

**4. Human Plank & Side Plank - for 60 seconds**These are great static holds for total core strength and toning. Do them anywhere, anytime – aim for 60 seconds, then build up to 2 minutes and more. Exhale everything in your system. Hold your body up on forearms (elbows under shoulders) and toes, pointing straight down. Take short, sharp strong breaths throughout. Do not ‘rest’ or ‘push’ on the balls of your feet by arching your back; all the weight pressure should be pointing down vertically. When you get strong enough try variations such lifting alternate feet off the ground for as long as you can or progress to a side-plank. 

Rest 60 seconds

**5. Bicycle Crunches -for 60 seconds**Get on your back, put your hands lightly behind your head, then raise your shoulders/core and twist your shoulders so your elbow reaches towards your opposite knee (eg; left elbow to right knee), which you bring up towards your chest. Be sure to extend your other leg out nice and straight. Do them fast and smooth – every single one you do means a flatter, healthier stomach. So go for it! Aim for 60 seconds non-stop. Do these as often as possible. Stop immediately if you feel any pain. 

Rest 60 seconds

**6. Push Ups Part 2- for 60 seconds**

Get into push up position. straighten your arms with hands under your shoulders. Keep your hands in this position as you bang out max rep push ups while pointing your BACK with each full-range downward motion. Keep your arms 'close' to your body - do not flare out your elbows. Breathe deeply, *in* through your nose and *out* through your mouth. *If you tire, proceed to partial reps to complete the 60 second time duration.* 

Rest 60 seconds

**7. TOE-TOUCH AB CRUNCHES - for 60 seconds**

Hop down on your back onto the ground, exhale to minimise the air in your lungs, contract your core, lift your head and heels off the ground for a second, then simultaneously reach your fingers up to meet your toes as you raise your straight legs off the ground as high as you can go. 

END CIRCUIT.

***IMPORTANT! - If you still have energy and strength to do more exercises after completing the 7 exercises in the allotted time, then*** ***start the circuit again and repeat as many exercises as possible.***

***YOU CAN AND YOU WILL SUCCEED! NOTHING CAN STOP YOU!***  

**OPTIONAL EXTRAS:** 

**If you have a access to a Pull up bar: Pull ups**

Grab the pull up bar with your palms facing forward and commence pull ups to max reps, even if it's ONE REP. When you can’t do any more full reps, proceed with partial reps. When you are too weak to do partial reps then just *hang* on the bar for as long as you can... until your finger grip diminishes and gives in and you drop off... Then, if you can, grab on again and try to complete the 60 seconds on the bar.

**Hanging leg raise ab crunch (using dip or hang position)**

You can do these hanging from a bar or on a dip bar. The trick is to keep your knees together and lift them up as high as possible to your chest very quickly. Then lower them slowly- but only as far as your thighs are parallel to the ground, it’s quite a tight, short movement; about 30cm – do not lower your knees all the way down. You must maintain core intensity throughout. However, when you are totally spent, you can go to partial reps to complete the minute. 

&#x200B;

OK - LET'S ALL EXCEED & EXCEL WHILE VIRUSES AND GOVERNMENTS WANT TO KEEP US IN LOCKDOWN ISOLATION. FREE YOUR BODY AND YOUR MIND WILL FOLLOW!

Feel free to ask any Q's or for any advice at any time! We are intros together and we will come out STRONGER together! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
Someone took a picture of me doing Calisthenics.,Str4ydogg,4481,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fbpc9w/someone_took_a_picture_of_me_doing_calisthenics/,1583039325.0,"I am just here to vent and see if anyone has had the same experience. 2 years ago I started working on my calisthenics journey. With ups and downs I made a lot of progress and I never thought anyone cared that much about how I decided to work out. Today someone posted a picture of me to an instagram meme page. They took the picture from the eliptical and captioned it ""N****s at my gym be doing to much"".
First of all one of the most annoying things about it is if it was a girl all the online white knights would have her back for invading her privacy, but because I am a male that did not apply. This meme page has 14.1m subscribers and over 50% of the comments are joking about the workout itself. The progression I was doing was the straddle back lever and the picture was taken at the height on the decline. It is so frustrating, but motivating how uneducated people are. They are quick to make fun of someone working hard from the sidelines. That won't stop me though. They can scroll their phones while they eat their twinkies and chips and ill be progressing daily. I only wish that these people would mind their own business and let people do what they love without judging or being hypocrites.

Here is the post if anyone is wondering.

Edit* I am completely new to this community, but its easy to see how awesome and supportive everyone is. I had no intention of giving up on my calisthenic goals, but your comments helped me get even more motivated. Thank you!

Edit 2* Just woke up and this blew up! Thank you guys for all the motivation and awards. Sorry I can't reply to all the comments!

Edit 3* A lot of you guys told me request I get tagged in it and make the most out of it, so I did last night. I was in shock initally and took everything people were saying as negative, but thanks to a lot of you I understand that even most of the jokes were not meant in a bad way."
I could finally fix my posture and forward neck after years. It was very simple.,None,4150,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7rjngr/i_could_finally_fix_my_posture_and_forward_neck/,1516380735.0,"I use the computer like 12 hs per day. So I had a very visible forward neck and back issues.

I do bodyweight training 3x a week. It wasn't helping me much I thought.

Then I added these exercises, because I saw it improved my posture a bit everytime I did them: http://www.drhimanshutyagi.in/images/spinalextension/case4/slider4.jpg

That did 1/3 of the trick. Another 1/3 of the solution came when I added neck exercises (for the back of the neck) to the routine. Basically after I do 10 of the exercises I showed above, I keep the body in the same position and just elevate my head alone trying to make the back of my head to touch my back (impossible of course but you get the idea). Something like this, but in horizontal position and with the face down as in the previous exercise: https://www.google.com.ar/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FhmXkjP-ZXoo%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhmXkjP-ZXoo&docid=Hys-_1YAm5HtRM&tbnid=qN16U-y9hcO68M%3A&vet=10ahUKEwis3_O0veTYAhUIkJAKHXUDA1gQMwiEAignMCc..i&w=1440&h=1080&client=firefox-b&bih=766&biw=1536&q=neck%20exercise&ved=0ahUKEwis3_O0veTYAhUIkJAKHXUDA1gQMwiEAignMCc&iact=mrc&uact=8

This would be a more extreme way to work those muscles. It wasn't needed for me to go this far: http://www.leehayward.com/pics/neckharness.jpg

Ok, so the other 1/3 of the solution was to keep good posture as much as possible. And the key is: don't look down. Whether you're trying to use your phone, or just looking at the floor while walking, etc, nono, never look at the floor. Always the head looking at the front, and the body in good posture. Even when you are in the computer, or anywhere. The back and neck exercises should allow you to keep the good posture easier.

I also added some stretching in the neck and shoulders that's recommended in many youtube videos.

The combination of everything did wonders for me. I'm like 75% cured of my neck and back problem. I thought I would never get rid of it.

Now I walk with a totally different posture. Sometimes it seems a bit extreme, like I'm walking on this alpha male posture, but I don't care what others think. It's just the correct way to walk to prevent further back issues.

I hope this helps someone.

As requested, here one before-after picture. As you can see I had a SEVERE case of forward neck. This was 75% fixed in two weeks. Of course I have to keep working on it, but it got much better.

Edit: to the people asking about the exercises. They are not static exercises, you need to move from point A to point B. And repeat at least 10 times. I normally do 3 series of 10 of each one. 3 times a week. Sometimes a bit more."
Lpt: Working out at the park without being creepy,superdpr,4109,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jxfbni/lpt_working_out_at_the_park_without_being_creepy/,1605833856.0,"With gyms closed, I’ve been doing lots of park workouts. Unfortunately my park borders an elementary school and parents tend to get uncomfortable and awkwardly stare at the very tall tattooed man working out next to their kids playground.

I’ve been working on ways to mitigate the weird stares and I’ve got a system that I thought I’d share as now people seem to walk by and not notice or glare, even if I’m doing pull-ups on a swing set in the playground.

I realized that the more I do to not draw attention to myself, the more weird looks I got. Trying to be hidden was actually a problem. Instead I wear bright colored shirts and hats, ideally the shirt is from a 5k or event.

Also when I do pull-ups I rest a bunch cuz they’re hard. When I’m just standing around, people stare confusedly at me. I find that having a sport water bottle and anything else that says “hey I’m working out” helps. As do big headphones. They say I’m not here to talk to anyone, just work out and go home.

Also in between sets I try to do some dynamic movements or stretch a bit of whatever I’m not working out that day so I stay busy. Since I’ve been doing that stuff I listed above I can work out in a family park next to an elementary School, even doing pull-ups on the playground and get no weird looks.

Now I know it may have all been in my head and who cares if people stare, but I know some of us (myself included) can feel a bit anxious when we make strangers uncomfortable. If you’re hesitating working out in a park or near a school, I suggest you try some of these things out and see if you feel better."
Fixing rounded shoulders posture with 1 exercise,MovementTom,4003,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7fur5f/fixing_rounded_shoulders_posture_with_1_exercise/,1511784686.0,"**Watch the video: https://youtu.be/GcV1Qdt686E**

Sup BWF people,

I created [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/70u1x3/do_you_have_rounded_shoulder_nerd_neck_me_too/) a few months ago in regards to improving posture and upper cross syndrome. It got a lot of love here so thought I would post this update to it.

The original post was a flexibility and strengthening routine that would be performed 2-4x per week. I still think this routine should be used as a solid foundation but incorporating a daily practice can really help speed up the process.

I called the exercise a [standing shoulder extension reach](https://youtu.be/GcV1Qdt686E?t=1m14s) which is something you've probably seen before. However by performing it in an active way it can stretch and strengthen at the same time. The important form cues to note would be:

* Chin tucked and tongue on the roof of the mouth to active deep cervical flexors and stretch neck extensors/levator scap.
* Shoulders retracted and depressed to stretch the pec minor, bicep brachii and surrounding fascia.
* Pelvis neutral and avoiding excessive lumbar extension but rather focus on extending through the thoracic.
* Actively reach down towards your feet to activate and strengthen the lower traps/rhomboids.

The exercise can be performed for 1-3 sets x 20-30s every day. It's a pretty straightforward exercise that can be performed if you're sat at work on a chair or anywhere really. Basically, there are no excuses to not give it a try.

As always, I'll be lurking on this subreddit so let me know your thoughts and if you try it!

What's good everybody, I've been a longtime lurker here and have been following the RR myself on/off for about a year or so.

First off, I gotta say the RR is a tremendous resource and I can't thank the people who put it together enough for spending the time to organize all the material. That being said, when I was first starting out I found myself pretty overwhelmed by all of the information and different options available.

So, I'm in the process of teaching myself web development and figured something like this site might be helpful for others who are starting out and feel overwhelmed by the amount of exercises, progressions, etc... in the RR.

Nothing would make me happier than if people ended up finding this site useful so thoughts and criticism in the comments are most welcome.

How To Strengthen Your Back in 5 Minutes a Day,JWLFit,3370,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fxrooc/how_to_strengthen_your_back_in_5_minutes_a_day/,1586435928.0,"# Back health matters now more than ever

Things have ground to a halt since the coronavirus emerged. Many people are working from home and many people have been laid off. There is more sitting, more bad posture, and having a strong back matters more than ever. I wanted to share a routine I developed to keep your back and core strong at home.

# The Routine

&#x200B;

* [Bird dog](https://imgur.com/6Kxwx07) 20 reps
* [Side plank](https://imgur.com/GXYm8NL) 30 seconds
* [Arch ups](https://imgur.com/FDsXeas) 20 reps
* [Side raises](https://imgur.com/V0ap9Jf) 20 reps
* Optional stretching
* Perform this routine anywhere from 1 time per week (minimum) up to 3 times per day. If I've been working for a while I'll take a 5-minute break and go through it. After I finish, I get right back to work with more energy and better posture.

## Bird Dogs Common Errors:

## [Your back leg is too high.](https://imgur.com/td9z257)

The back leg isn't supposed to go up; it's supposed to go back. Raising the back leg too high forces the back to arch and builds bad habits. Don't drive your back leg up, drive it back. Try to reach your heel as far behind you as you can.

## You're rushing it.

You should be pausing at the top of every rep for a ""one one-thousand."" I want you to feel your muscles contract every single rep. Every rep is a chance for you to get better, focus, and be deliberate.

## Side Plank Common Errors:

## [Your hips are too low.](https://imgur.com/ASd8bQx)

If you can't do 30 seconds with perfect form, start with 15 seconds and gradually build to 30 seconds.

## You're not using your glutes.

Squeeze your glutes; they will improve your balance and stabilize you.

## Arch Up Common errors:

## [You aren't using your legs.](https://imgur.com/pCKJXu8)

Arch ups are a whole-body exercise, raise your feet off the ground every rep.

## You're rushing it.

See above.

## Side Raise Common errors:

## [You're not moving your upper body.](https://imgur.com/6gIyf06)

You should be raising your upper and lower body for each rep. Bring your shoulder to the ceiling. You should feel your obliques working more.

## Stretching is good, right?

I think stretching for back pain is overrated. Stretching relaxes and lengthens tight muscles to make room for underactive muscles to contribute. The problem is that stretching on its own won't activate or use the underactive muscles or train the core. All that being said, stretching (particularly the hamstrings) can help when coupled with other exercises.

## Here is how to tell if your hamstrings are tight.

Lie on your back, keep your legs straight, and raise one until it can't go further without bending or lifting your other leg. If your leg gets to 90 degrees, you're good. Anything less and stretching will help.

## [Here is how you should stretch.](https://imgur.com/WNblU6K)

Here is the best way I've found to stretch the hamstrings. Put your foot on a chair, bend forward, keeping your chest tall and back straight. When you can't go any further without bending forward, contract your hamstrings for 5 seconds. Think about pushing your heel down into the ground. Try not to bend at the knee. Once you relax, you should be able to move another inch or so, repeat 3-5 times on each side.

## Most common errors:

## [You're stretching your hamstring with a rounded back.](https://imgur.com/nkC1c9s)

The reason we're stretching the hamstrings is to stop rounding the low back. We want to build flexibility with the back in a neutral position.

## You're flexing at the knee, not the hip.

The best results come from flexing the hamstring at the hip, try to push from your butt and not your knee. Flexing at the knee will work, but flexing from the hip works better.

## You need to contract for longer.

1-2 seconds isn't enough, hold for a five-count. You should feel your muscles relax afterward. If you still feel tight, then reduce the stretch and try again.

## You're going too far.

You should feel a stretch, not pain. If you start breathing hard, you've gone too far.

## You're holding your breath.

Holding your breath is a symptom of stretching too far. Ease up, relax, and breathe deeply.

## What about those foam rollers and lacrosse balls?

Self-myofascial release (SMR) quiets down overactive muscles through external pressure. Like stretching on its own, SMR doesn't fix bad habits, and the effects are temporary. If you enjoy SMR, then go for it. Stretching has worked better for me and my clients. Contract release stretching also builds the mind-muscle connection. If I had to pick between stretching and SMR, I would pick stretching.

## I'm ready for more, what are some more advanced exercises?

&#x200B;

* [Bird dog to straddle](https://imgur.com/G2qnbLK)

* [Arch up superman](https://imgur.com/gZFhNNF)
* Longer duration side plank, [side plank rotates](https://imgur.com/pSZk5Q8)

If you want to know why this routine works, then read on.

# The Nerdy Stuff

## Don't round your back

Stuart McGill, a very prominent back pain researcher, has done research linking back pain to chronic flexion (i.e., rounding). Weakness in the core and low back create bad posture, which puts extra pressure on the spine and disks. Too much pressure coupled with spinal flexion can lead to injuries like herniation. Keeping the back healthy is done by strengthening the core, low back, and building good movement habits.

## Your core is probably weak

The core isn't a muscle; it's a relationship of muscles. The muscles in our torso bridge the gap between our ribcage and our hips; they are the base of movement. They become rigid and stable when we deadlift, and they become mobile when we rotate or bend. If you want a strong core, then you need to train it both as a stabilizer and as a mobilizer.

## You need to train diagonal motion

Do you know how your right foot goes forward with your left arm when you walk? The arms and legs work in opposition to maintain balance, try walking with the same arm and leg and you'll see what I mean. That diagonal movement pattern is everywhere, and you need to train it. Bird dogs are part of this routine because they teach you to balance and stabilize in the diagonal pattern without arching your back too much.

## Here is why these exercises work

## Neurological connection

My opinion is that these exercises work by creating a stronger connection between the brain and the back. You ever tell somebody they're rounding their back during a deadlift and they say ""I am?"" Knowing where your body is in space is called proprioception, and our backs are terrible at it. If the brain doesn't know what the low back is doing or where it is, then it will make mistakes. These exercises train the brain to move the back with balance, stability, and efficiency.

## Obliques

Another factor is the obliques. This routine strengthens the obliques, which for many people are weak, tight, and need some attention. Remember, the core is a relationship of muscles. A weak link will affect everything. The obliques are the weak link for most people.

## Blood flow

Finally, these exercises promote blood flow to the back. Blood is liquid life. It brings nutrients, removes waste products, the more blood an injury gets, the faster it heals. Extra blood flow isn't likely a significant factor, but its a bonus.

Hopefully, you found this routine helpful, leave a comment, and let me know what you thought. Stay healthy, stay safe, and stay strong.

&#x200B;

edit: The frequency part was confusing. The minimum I would recommend doing this routine is once per week. The maximum is 3 times per day but that number is kind of arbitrary. Some days I'll do this routine once, sometimes three times, sometimes not at all, do whatever feels good for you and works in your schedule.  "
"You NEED rest weeks. This is part of a solid training lifestyle, you don't get farther by never taking time off (it also doesn’t mean you’re lazy or that you're gonna lose all your progress or gain a bunch of fat)",stickysweetastytreat,3292,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kzi407/you_need_rest_weeks_this_is_part_of_a_solid/,1610927215.0,"Don't underestimate the importance of recovery weeks. Yes, a literal WEEK where you don’t train anywhere near your regular intensity. And this perspective of always *needing* to feel like you’re being pushed to the edge relentlessly, and that you’re lazy or bad for taking even a DAY off.. it needs to go. And yes, sometimes there IS a mental component that makes you believe you're gonna \*lose it all\* if you take a week off.. but do you really think you'll balloon 20 lbs or lose months of muscle just because you took a WEEK off? Did it take you a week to gain 20 lbs or build those muscles?

Your body isn’t just a pile of muscles that control your skeleton. You are a nervous system too. And the nervous system doesn’t categorize different kinds of stress into their own little buckets. Physical stress **(which includes working out)** comes out of the same bucket as sleep (quality AND quantity), illness, and “regular life” stress like shit at work, finances, family, relationship stress, etc. Even this fucking pandemic lol. It’s not like mind and body are separate entities or that one doesn't take a toll on the other.

You may want to read up on the idea of **overcompensation**. No system likes to be run at redline all the time right? This includes our bodies. If you’re training at a high enough intensity and then only resting juuuust enough to replenish what you just used up in the previous workout, that means there hasn’t been an opportunity to build your range out-- which means your redline is still in the same spot it was before, you didn't give your body a chance to make additional space. How are you going to have a net gain over time (i.e., nudging your baseline higher and higher) if you don’t give your body enough of an opportunity to *over*compensate? (This is the answer to ""Why don't rest days after a workout count?"")

Something else about the stress response is that it tends to feed on itself. You start to feel awful, your perform starts to drop, your injury risk goes up, your overall outlook starts to go to shit.. and then that causes more stress, which continues the stress response. Before you know it, you’re barely sleeping (which also means you’re not getting enough deep sleep for your brain to signal for more testosterone or human growth hormone, which normally get released during deep sleep aka slow wave sleep), you’re eating like shit because you don’t have the motivation or energy to cook a good quality meal and just reach for the closest calorically dense, nutritionally sparse carb-y pastry, etc. See how it tends to create its own vortex?

So if you’re not able to figure out why you feel like you've hit a wall despite the fact that you’ve been working SO HARD for months and being so diligent about never missing a day, and you SWEAR you're eating enough protein and even weighed out all your food-- it’s time to try something different right? **Take a week off.**  I am not saying this is the ONLY answer if you've tried all those other things-- I am saying this may be your blind spot. This gets more and more important as you move along your training journey.

Btw if you want a more objective way of measuring your recovery or you just like to quantify or nerd out about gadget-y things, look up Heart Rate Variability, HRV. I’ve been experimenting with the Whoop strap, but there are some apps that measure your HR by pressing your finger against the camera light on your phone. Basically, it measures between each heartbeat, which is influenced by the interactions between two prongs of your nervous system; it can tell you how dominant one is over the other (you want MORE variability)

**The rule of thumb is one recovery week every 6-8 weeks but it can be more frequent if your body is sending you red flags before then.**

Ideas for what to do during recovery weeks:

* same workout but keep it less than half the intensity you're used to (but if you're not feeling good during the -50% workout, take the hint lol)
* work on mobility & flexibility.. go befriend a foam roller
* work on a skill AS LONG AS it's not intense
* go on a walk or an easy hike, or a mellow yoga class
* review your other health habits and see what you want to optimize (like figuring out a plan to implement better sleep hygiene, planning out a better grocery shopping list, etc)

This is also discussed in the sidebar here but it's pretty buried:

Hey I really appreciate the awards! Thank you!! :D

&#x200B;

Second edit:

People asking for scientific studies.. the importance & value of recovery in a high-intensity training program is very well documented. I encourage everyone to do their own research. Some terms you could look up: overcompensation/supercompensation, hormones & slow wave sleep, exercise and the sympathetic vs parasympathetic nervous system. Better yet, test it for yourself!"

Starting To Stretch is our own full-body flexibility program that was designed for r/flexibility beginners!

It consists of 10 stretches divided into 2 equal parts (upper body and lower body). The focus of the program is on inflexible beginners and their typical needs: Shoulders, Thoracic Spine, Hips, Hamstrings, Wrists and Calves. Almost every of the exercises can be progressed to a specific skill if done long enough.

**Follow Along: [You can follow along the whole routine with this video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVPyAU4l-sw)**

**Cheat Sheet here: [.png](https://i.imgur.com/NtMb2cX.jpg) | [.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/us4yj3usf76teu2/sts.pdf?dl=0)**

## Programming

Do this program 2-3 times a week! It will take ~30 minutes. If you have time issues, you can switch between upper and lower body.

The stretching protocol is to be done in the following order. Try to go a little deeper each time after the bumping movements. 

* Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch
* Hold the stretch for 10 seconds
* Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch
* Hold the stretch for 20 seconds
* Do 10 small gentle bumping movements into the stretch
* Hold the stretch for 30 seconds
* Done. Don't forget to breathe!

## The Stretches

### Upper Body ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=159))

* **[Shoulder Backbend](https://i.imgur.com/VlZ0FVr.png)** | The shoulder backbend focuses on shoulder overhead flexibility. This is important for many weightlifting exercises, but also for handstands and hand-balancing. It is also important for shoulder health, especially when older. Stand up with a straight bodyline, tense your butt muscles and move your arms overhead. Move your arms backwards without losing the straight bodyline. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=161))

* **[Spine Backbend](https://i.imgur.com/GqJdRKA.png)** | The spine backbend focuses on thoracic spine mobility. If you ever dreamt of doing bridges on the floor, this is your exercise. A good thoracic spinal mobility can be progressed into all kinds of [fancy exercises](https://media3.giphy.com/media/12lXUg3Zm8jhjW/200w.gif). Place your palms (or fingertips) on your shoulderblades and tense your butt. Now lean back without arching your lower back and move the arms. You can bend the knees a little. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=357))

* **[Rear Hand Clasp](https://i.imgur.com/2Tb7ric.png)** | Did you ever want to scratch your back but couldn't reach the spot because you lacked behind-the-back flexibility? This is your exercise. It's good for your shoulderblades and to counter long sitting periods. This stretch is very important for upper body posture aswell! Get into a straight bodyline. Take a towel, a band or a t-shirt and grab both ends with your arms. One arm is overhead and one is behind the back. The upper arm pulls the lower arm gently into the stretch. Pull upwards. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=494))

* **[Lying Cross](https://i.imgur.com/IghCB3M.png)** | The lying cross is a stretch that is aimed at people with poor posture. Start on all fours and move one arm below the other arm until your shoulder [touches the floor.](https://i.imgur.com/gSSlesx.png) To deepen the stretch, lay down on the floor and extend the non-stretched arm to the front. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=809))

* **[Wrist-Biceps Stretch](https://i.imgur.com/oLzxXRA.png)** | This stretch works on your wrist flexibility and stretches your forearms, your biceps and your deltoid muscles. Stand next to a wall and place your palms on it. Fingers pointing backwards. Now straighten your arm and twist your upper body to the opposite direction. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=962))

### Lower Body ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248))

* **[One-Leg Pike](https://i.imgur.com/AkQKIrG.png)** | This stretches your hamstrings. Most people that sit on a computer all day have tight hamstrings, because those muscles are very tensed in a chair-sitting position. When you stretch them regularily, you can take load off your lower back. Flexible hamstrings progress into [the pike stretch](http://bravocrossfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seated-pike-.jpg). Place your foot on a chair and lean forward with a straight back. If you're advanced enough to touch your toes with a straight back (!), then you can progress to the [standing version of the stretch.](https://i.imgur.com/SWZAKMa.png) ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1248))

* **[Kneeling Lunge](https://i.imgur.com/uzdn3Ad.png)** | The kneeling lunge works on your hamstrings, your quads and your hip muscles like the iliopsoas. This is the most important stretch to gain flexibility for the [front splits](https://cdn.gmb.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/splits-front.jpg). Place one foot in front of you and extend it slowly with a straight back. Use your hands to balance yourself properly. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=1521))

* **[Pancake](https://i.imgur.com/uOIvAJG.png)** | The pancake stretches your hamstrings and your leg adductors. With strong leg adductors, you will have it much easier in martial arts and all dance moves.

* **[Calf Stretch](https://i.imgur.com/eWF32yZ.png)** | Many people neglect their calf muscles, although it is necessary to give your calves some love. Tight calves love to cramp and hurt. It can prevent heel spurs and all kind of degenerative feet diseases to regularily stretch and strengthen your feet muscles. Grab something and bend one knee forward. Extend the back leg and try to push the heel into the ground. ([Video](https://youtu.be/VVPyAU4l-sw?t=2043))

# Frequently Asked Questions

###**Why didn't you include [insert stretch]?!**

Starting To Stretch is meant to give you the best ""bang for your buck"" and focuses on the most common problem areas. Feel free to insert your own specific stretch into the program!

***

###**How often should i do this program?**

A good starting point would be two times a week. If you have the time, do it three times a week! If you lack time, split it up into upper and lower body and do both once a week.

***

###**Can i do this every day?**

Absolutely! However, if you feel pain or discomfort, do it a bit less. Your muscles need rest too and stretching is taxing your nervous system quite hard.

***

###**I have medical condition [insert here], can i do the program?**

There's no one-size-fits-all answer for this one. Ask on the subreddit and people will make sure to help you with your specific problem.

***

###**When should i do the program?**

Any time when you are relatively stress free is perfect. When your mind is relaxed, stretching is easier. Don't do it before a workout, because it increases injury risk. After a workout is fine!

***

###**I don't like this stretch: [insert stretch], can i replace it with something else?**

Absolutely! You won't benefit from stretches that you don't do, because you hate them. Switch them up as much as you like and need.

# Why would one man do such a thing?

Well, let me first start off by saying, this turned into a much bigger project than I was originally expecting...

Long story short I expected the internet to already have this, but it didn’t to my surprise! [Greatist ](https://greatist.com/fitness/bodyweight-push-up-variations#expert)had an 80+ push up list that was alright but did a poor job of conveying the difference in difficulty between progressions. It also used a lot of slightly different variations to get to that 80+ number.

Youtube also failed me in this search. Almost all videos had less than 50 push-ups and most LVL 1-100 took big leaps between ‘levels’. I just felt like there was very unclear information for people to set their expectations by.

But more than anything, I’m working hard on what seems like a far off dream of making youtube a full-time job. I cannot think of a more fun way to spend my day than teaching people and entertaining them with the hobby/sport/passion that I love so much. So expect a lot more videos from me in the future on Youtube, and definitely smaller projects so I can get them out a bit faster!

# Ongoing Updates/Moving Forward (how to submit a push up I missed):

So yeah... I expect more than a few “you forgot xyz” push up, but I’m all ears!

I think we could make this a community-style list that could just be a good reference point for everyone. I’m thinking of using it like the Overcoming Gravity 2 list that I have referenced more than a few times.

The only real rule I had when making the selections was that it had to be able to be found from multiple sources, preferably on different platforms (Youtube, Google, Reddit). There are a lot of slightly different variations that cannot be found outside of their bubble, so I tried to play it a tad conservative.

Also, I could have quintupled this list with variations like Knee, Tucked, Adv Tuck, Half Lay, Straddle Half Lay, Open Adv Tuck, Degrees of Incline/Decline. So I think we’d have to play it conservatively with adding things that fit into those variations to keep this a manageable size.

Totally open to speaking with any mods or users that would want to help me upkeep this list so that it’s a useful tool for a long time to come.

Thanks for checking it out! :)

I JUST DID 5 PULLUPS FOR THE FIRST TIME!,MrBlueLizard,3084,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i2uutj/i_just_did_5_pullups_for_the_first_time/,1596451623.0,"I've been following the the fitness plan on this subreddit all quarantine, and it is the first workout routine which has worked for me in the last 3 years of (in)consistently working out. 

The beginning of April I was able to do 3 half-assed *chinups*, where I'd start with my elbows at 90 degrees to my upper arm and would only reach about eye level on my rings.

As I followed through with the routine, with lateral rows, straight hangs, and negatives, I have now progressed to a point where I can do about 5 real pull ups - dead hang to chin over rings! I have never been prouder of myself and am glad I found the guide here. I have also made considerable progress on dips and L-sits. My pushups have remained the same however as I have overtrained my pushing muscles in the past where they have considerably more definition than my pull group, although I did have gotten to a point where I can do 5 sets of 10 clapping push ups very well, I could do 5x10 regular ones before I started though. I can also do partial handstand pushups now!

I love this community, and I strive to be as good as some of you doing advanced calisthenics movements like front levers and human flags. Thanks for all the motivation and guidance!"
"I am prepared to be judged like the lazy ass procrastinator I am, but...The recommended routine is a wall of confusing text and links containing equipment I don't have, with exercises I don't understand conceptually. I am going somewhere with this I promise.",overzealoushobo,3045,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/e5i1ba/i_am_prepared_to_be_judged_like_the_lazy_ass/,1575384108.0,"Here is the thing: There are several types of people when it comes to self improvement.  Some just need a little push, some need more time, some need more motivation or perhaps some time management.  There are plenty success stories to validate the recommended routine.


But I am the type of person, who represents the silent group of people who struggle with depression, anxiety, procrastination, time management, perhaps even a little bit of a attention deficit issues who visit the recommended routine page and, after reading and clicking links, gives up and say ""nah, too much going on here, I'll never succeed""  I WANT to be better.  I've been subbed for ages now, just reading success stories and thinking that if I could just commit, I'd be able to feel good again.

There was a post earlier:

""What if you have no specific goal but just want basic health and fitness? Here's a good answer to that question""


Honestly I was kind of pumped up reading it.  FINALLY someone is going to spoon-feed me exactly what I should be doing.  It all seemed really straight forward, although I do get caught up on ""progression"" exercises, because it seems like sometimes in the middle of a progression forward, some kind of equipment is thrown in that I don't have access to, so then I wonder if I should skip to the next hardest or stay on the easier version.
                                                                                                                                                              

That post was kind of destroyed in the comments ""you're over thinking it"" ""why not just do the recommended routine"" ""this is not beginner stuff"" ""this takes too long""

And so on.  I went from motivated to deflated in about 10 mins time.  Also, I think some folks keep ""just do the recommended routine"" permanently on their clipboard so they can spam it as needed.  It's like being in a gym as a nervous overweight dude, and all the gym rats are shaking their heads like ""it's obvious to me what needs to be done, why doesn't this guy just DO it"" 

All of this is to say, some people have to have their hand held to get started.  Honestly, I just wish I could find someone or some post that flat out says ""Do exactly these these things for exactly this long on this many days"" and you will be a healthier happier human. Which is why that post earlier today initially excited me.  BUT I recognize that it's not one size fits all, which is why the RR is as complicated as it is.  It requires some footwork.  If only everyone could have a personal trainer, right?


I just figured I'd voice some of the frustration I feel with the disconnect that happens between those who ""get"" it and those who don't.  It's not that we don't want to, it's that there is a mental or physical block that makes even putting together a personalized workout seem tedious and stressful.  

It would be cool if there was an app that let you input your exercise levels, all equipment access you personally have, age, lifestyle, weight, goals, etc and it just populated a RR based on your personal stats and tools.  I feel like I could use the shit out of that.  It could even recommend new equipment along the way as you progress.

**EDIT:** So, a few things...

* The Recommended Routine is a fantastic resource created (for free!) as a labor of love by people who are passionate about getting fit in a safe and consistent way.  They should be commended for the hard work, and dedication it takes to create something that has such a huge impact.
                                                                                                                                       

* The RR is clearly effective for those who put in the time to educate themselves using the guide.
                                                                                                                                           
* I really didn't expect this to blow up, I just wanted to have a discussion with like minded individuals with ideas for those (including myself) who find the RR intimidating, but still have a vested interest in their physical health, using primarily body weight fitness to workout. 
                                                                                                                                                         
* TIL ""spoon-fed"" is a realllly hated way to describe learning something new.
                                                                                                                                 
* Lack of motivation ≠ laziness.  There are many people, including those who use this sub to better themselves, who were lacking motivation before they improved their lives.  Shame on those who are discouraging those people.

* Lastly, there is some shameful shit hitting my inbox from some users of this sub.  There was some fair criticism as well, and I did say I was prepared to be judged.  But exaggerating mental instability, saying I'm illiterate, lazy, won't ever improve...pretty childish stuff.  Rule # 4 guys, don't be a fucknugget. 


There was a ton of great discussion here, and I want to thank everyone who messaged me with both encouragement and new ideas for what I can try to get out of the slump.  I will be reading for days!"
"Diamond pushups use more chest than wide pushups (from a study that also examined standard, pseudo-planche and simplified Lalanne pushups).",RockRaiders,2928,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7x0jqq/diamond_pushups_use_more_chest_than_wide_pushups/,1518440276.0,"**Note: the point of this post is not that diamond pushups are the ultimate chest exercise, but that wide pushups on the floor are overrated and many exercises are better than them for chest growth.**

I often see people repeating the broscience (BS) that wide pushups are the best for chest and that diamond pushups only increase tricep activity.

**Edit:** /u/MrSylphie (ThunderThighs) makes a good point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7x0jqq/diamond_pushups_use_more_chest_than_wide_pushups/du4n9px/) that in this study EMG may give inaccurate results because of significant variations of intensity and scapular position. Based on how most people do wide pushups (in a T shape), they'll still get more chest activation from narrow pushups and less chance of impingement because that T shape takes the load away from the muscles and puts strain on the shoulder joints.

For some more information about impingement, see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4wfh6i/everyone_tells_you_that_flared_elbows_are_bad/) by /u/tykato and [this comment exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7x0jqq/diamond_pushups_use_more_chest_than_wide_pushups/du4zjps/).

Diamond pushups are useful to prepare the elbows for muscle ups as described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3dylwg/how_can_you_increase_tendon_strengthdurability/ctb9znq/), and if you do high rep training they'll be more useful than wide ones. Otherwise they are just a stepping stone to more intense variations (pseudo-planche, rings, unilateral, weighted etc.). Progressive overload is key for strength and size.

If you want to build specifically the chest, chest flyes ([rings](https://youtu.be/1eqKau93EPw?t=11s) or [floor](https://youtu.be/FF2l3oV-Q3w?t=7s)) are the best isolation, for compound movements consider weighted pushups (to load heavily, even beyond 100% bodyweight added, use [a dip belt with hands and feet elevated](https://youtu.be/W6F1XK67gOM?t=1m38s) or a [robust backpack placed on the back from an elevated surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCOmX38kLRA)). Also band pushups can give similar gains to a bench press if done with similar form, according to [this article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/band-resisted-pushups-bench-press-for-strength-gains-plus-how-useful-is-emg/) which also talks about the pros and cons of EMG as a study tool. 

Other compound movements with no equipment that challenge the chest are any of the harder pushups mentioned earlier, and also dips with some forward lean (increase lean or add weight), ring dips and with rings turned out if you want more intensity.

**The article:** (not as reliable as I thought, you can see my original reasoning but it's likely to be wrong)

[Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4732391/) is the full article of a study that examined the muscle activation in 5 pushup variations (shoulder width, double shoulder width, diamond, hands 20cm back (pseudo-planche), hands 20cm forward (sort of a [Lalanne pushup](https://youtu.be/WoR3PJsxCAg?t=10s), I guess they used a hand placement like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCOYxVku0Is) ).

Data was collected using EMG, each participant did 10 repetitions per exercise (after 5 minutes of practice, each pushup variation in random order and 3 minutes rest) using a 2.5 second duration of the repetition (so I guess 1.25 seconds ascent and descent, a metronome was used). I'm not exactly sure how well they maintained the lean in pseudo-planche pushups or how the hands forward pushups looked like, it would have been interesting to have some photos from the study.

**Results:** [this figure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4732391/figure/i1062-6050-50-11-1126-f01/) shows respectively average muscle activation, ascent (concentric) activation, descent (eccentric) activation for several muscles. The graphs are not very intuitive so [here](https://i.imgur.com/7qnML2j.jpg) is a better image. If you don't know about some of these muscles or their role look them up [here](http://www.exrx.net/Lists/Directory.html).

* Wide pushups are the best for [causing shoulder impingement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L4kdK-vqBY) and very overrated for chest development. If you want to isolate the chest, do the chest fly on [rings](https://youtu.be/1eqKau93EPw?t=11s) or [the floor](https://youtu.be/FF2l3oV-Q3w?t=7s).
* It was already well known that diamond pushups use more triceps than wide and standard, but they use more chest too.
* Hands forward pushups have the most abdominal activation. It makes sense if you think about how they are similar to an extended plank, and the Lalanne pushup, which is the ultimate version, is similar to the superman plank and an easier version of the ab wheel rollout.
* Pseudo-planche pushups increase the challenge for most muscles, especially the anterior shoulders (deltoids), but have less tricep activation than diamond and hands forward pushups. I expected to see more serratus anterior activation since people talk a lot about protraction in the planche. Also note how the spinal erectors work a lot more than in other pushups since the feet have less weight on them and as you lean forward more they'll eventually ""float"" thanks to the lower back lifting the legs off the ground. The lats probably work more because of the need for scapular depression. Not sure about why the middle traps worked more (maybe they stabilized the scapula against excessive downward rotation?).

Picking Children Up: Deadlift or squat?,DoomGoober,2874,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/efibic/picking_children_up_deadlift_or_squat/,1577290883.0,"Since it's Christmas, you'll be hanging out with your children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, children of friends, or friends of children. So you may be wondering: Is picking up a child more of a deadlift or a squat? (Assume, of course, the child is shorter than you. If not, picking them up is an overhead press/pike push up.)

Now, assuming your child is in the standard ""pick me up, I'm tired from walking 2 blocks"" pose. You would probably assume a deadlift is appropriate, given the extra strength, and the name (your child is dead tired and you are trying to lift them.) However, the deadlift with overhand grip positions the fingers directly into the child's armpits which may trigger squirming from the child and cause extra instability. Because of this, you must instead rely on the front squat, which allows us to place our hands underhand under the child's armpits. The exception to this rule is a child who has thrown themselves on the floor, for example, during a tantrum caused by eating 4 pieces of chocolate and being denied the 5th. In this case a deadlift is fine, given the child's armpit angle is now parallel to the floor and frankly the kid doesn't care if your fingers jab his/her armpits (nor will you be caring about anything other than, ""When will this screaming and crying creature turn 18?"")

Now you may be wondering: Can I clean and jerk children? The answer is no. A slow and controlled squat followed by overhead press, however, may cause the child to giggle.

Just don't drop your weights at the end of a rep.

Merry Christmas!"

In October I had a bad skateboarding crash (check out my right eye) and was in the ER for 2 days with a head injury. I tried to stay consistent but definitely felt the pressure building in my head so I had to take it super easy for about 6 weeks. I’m still dealing with a lot of right elbow pain from some nerve damage but it’s slowly getting better and hopefully I can start working in chin-up variations again. Although it was tough getting back into the rhythm of my routine, overcoming laziness and self pity only boosted my confidence. It’s like the goat said, “In the struggle is where life happens.” - Jeff goldbum’s acting teacher from a desus and meró interview. 


Here’s my current routine:
- ring towel assisted pull-up
- 1-legged pistol squat
- ring dips w/knee twist (no RTO because of elbow pain)
- Nordic curl (negative with push-up asst)
- tucked ring row 
- RTO push-up
- ab circuit (r/leanbeefpatty edition: v-ups, bicycles, flutter kick, leg crunch, Russian twist). 

Equipment: 
Rings 

Supps:
- vegan protein shake (~5x’s a week)
- 5mg creatine (~4x’s a week)
- multivitamin (~3x’s a week) 

Happy holidays to all! Let’s get this shih!

I DID 15 PULL-UPS IN A ROW FOR THE FIRST TIME!,MrBlueLizard,2693,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mhs2cp/i_did_15_pullups_in_a_row_for_the_first_time/,1617271481.0,"Following up from my last post in August: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i2uutj/i\_just\_did\_5\_pullups\_for\_the\_first\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i2uutj/i_just_did_5_pullups_for_the_first_time/)

tl;dr: I started working out in April 2020 where I couldn't even do 3 chinups but made it to 5 proper perfect form pull-ups by August 2020 following the RR.

I just thought I would share this achievement with the community that helped me get there. I regained access to the gym as COVID-19 eased up where I live, so I've been mixing in some resistance training with calisthenics every alternate day. Noticed a plateau in my squats so I've moved on to weighted squats. Also plateaued on my push-ups, but after adding bench presses (which I actually hit 70kg PRs in after \~6 months of the RR). Since August last year, I've seen pretty good gains overall.

Star of the show, however, pull-ups! I've always struggled with them over my time pursuing fitness, so hitting just 5 in a row last August was a massive achievement. Mixing them up with some lat pulldowns and lateral rows, following up on advice from you all in the comments (greasing the grove actually worked super well) and losing a few KGs has finally led to me doing something I never thought was possible - 15 straight pull-ups. Although I'm still a little bit on the bigger side (90kg now), these personal bests have made me feel, for the first time in my life, that I could be really fit. I haven't had much inclination or confidence to pursue tricks (though I have worked up to do unsupported handstands, even if for a couple seconds), but I think I'm ready to get into it at this point in time.

My self-confidence levels have shot up because I now look marginally better than I used to and can do so much more physically. Post-quarantine, this lady who hadn't responded super well to me asking her out in the past commented, ""You had such a glow up"", and even though that is a shallow metric to compare growth with, I would be lying if I said that it didn't feel damn good. I really can't be happier with where my life is going.

So thanks so much for the continued support and motivation, everyone. Joining this subreddit has been one of the best decisions of my life and I'm so, so excited to see where this is going. 

To anyone new to bodyweight workouts who is reading this - commit to it and you'll improve in no time! I can't say if this style of exercise will suit anyone, but as someone who was not responding very well to resistance training prior to this, all I have is good news. Have fun unlocking the true potential of your body!"
"Tight and weak wrists are a common limiting factor with bodyweight exercises, but incorporate these two active mobility exercises that require NO equipment and they will be stronger and more flexible than ever!",Antranik,2648,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bavuuy/tight_and_weak_wrists_are_a_common_limiting/,1554740796.0,"Whether it's for pushups, handstands, planche, yoga, or the other endless endeavors we have aspirations for, spend enough time on your hands and you'll eventually experience your wrists being a limiting factor in your training. They aren't used to dealing with heavy loads, but the good news is they can be built up toward it!

Years ago I've personally had my fair share of wrist sprains (and shared all the tips I've amassed for dealing with that [here](http://antranik.org/wrist-sprains/)) and I'm happy to say that not only are wrist sprains a distant memory, but are stronger than ever for the past couple years so I'd like to share how I did it with these 2 simple and effective bodyweight exercises!


# 1. Palm Pulse Progressions: https://youtu.be/xLQkpuDS1PY

Palm Pulses will strengthen and stretch your wrists and knuckles (MCP joints). They're often perfect for doing on hands and knees, but too big of a jump in intensity for doing them in plank, but with this progression (demonstrated in the video), you will narrow the gap and see progress very fast!

* Progression:
 * Palm Pulses on Hands and Knees
 * Palm Pulses Slow Negatives in Plank
 * Palm Pulses in Plank

**Tip:** If you are severely lacking flexibility to move the palms up, stretch each finger individually beforehand. 

# 2. Back of Hand Wrist Pushup Progressions: https://youtu.be/T58Gmo77Iow

These back of hand wrist pushups are extremely good at stretching *and* strengthening your wrists and the **extensor muscles** (muscles on top of forerm) which are generally weak relative to our flexors, so it's a really great exercise to counter all the hanging/pulling/climbing work we tend to do (the imbalance of which is often the cause of tennis elbow/lateral epicondylitis). Plus this will increase the wrist flexibility one requires for the **false grip** if the wrist-flexion range is lacking.

* Progression:
 * on Hands and Knees
 * Against a wall, chest height
  * The more you walk back or lower you place your hands on the wall, the harder.
 * In Plank

Note: Simply holding this position might feel very intense if you aren't used to it. Aim to have the elbows straight the best you can, breathe, and do a little bit each day and you'll progress.

#Tip for both exercises:

* In regards to tempo, do not speed through these and don't use momentum. Emphasize a slow and controlled pace for complete mastery.
* Aim to do a couple sets in the morning as part of a simple daily routine for consistency. 
* The intermediate progressions may feel really difficult and you might not be able to do many reps, but you'll notice an increase in form quality, better tempo control or number of reps with nearly every session.

Armed with these two simple and effective exercises that have their own progression pathway, you now know enough to keep your wrists healthy for most things BWF! Hope that helps!"

Upon request, and due to the extensive discussion around needing something like this, I have spent the last few days creating a detailed tutorial running through the beginner recommended routine on this subreddit! It includes GIFs of each movement from Warm-up, Bodyline, Skill work and all the Strength Pairs and tips for form including some examples of incorrect versions of a movement.

I figured this would be useful for those new years resolution-ers that want to start working out in the new year. This ended up being around 3000 words with 30 GIFs so it's pretty massive and loaded quite slowly. As a result I condensed each section into a drop-down menu which you have to click on in order to expand it.

Hopefully you guys find it useful! For those with more experience, if you have any suggestions for things to add or have noticed that I may have missed something out, please point it out! For beginners, if you feel I have not explained something well enough or have any other questions on things I haven't yet mentioned, feel free to ask!

From 2 Pull-ups to 12 Muscle-ups in 1 year,ElvisLifts,2580,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/igf5cf/from_2_pullups_to_12_muscleups_in_1_year/,1598371807.0,"Hello! It's Elvis here some people may know me from my previous posts but most of you most likely don't know me so I will introduce myself. My name is Elvis I am 26 years old and I from Latvia! At the moment I am working full time job but in the free time I can call myself a calisthenics enthusiast for the past 13 months and a bit.. so basically 1 year!

I did share my progress in looks and some strength feats but in my opinion this is my biggest achievement for now especially if we consider that I am quite tall 1.89m/6'2 ft. and also quite heavy as well for doing calisthenics (95kg/209lbs). So everything I learn or achieve feels like a great accomplishment and it doesn't come easy for me! It took me almost a year to do proper L-sit (that's because I have quite big legs and I think that is the reason why it was so difficult) so that will put things into perspective how hard progress comes for me! 

&#x200B;

Time period: 13 months

Training type : Calisthenics

Cardio : Running, Swimming, Cycling, Box, HIIT and some circuit training as well

&#x200B;

My training schedule:

Calisthenics: 3-4 times a week

Cardio: 3-4 times a week (I usually do cardio after my workout)

Weight lifting (mostly for legs): 2 times a week

&#x200B;

**Physique progress and pictures:**

[After picture with no pump or flexing](https://imgur.com/a/2YzQGcr)

[After picture on pump with flex](https://imgur.com/a/dPUnovm)

&#x200B;

In the before pictures I've just started calisthenics and my heaviest weight was 114kg/251lbs. **I did have background in lifting weights so it's very important that people acknowledge this fact and don't think I've made that progress from zero.** I've had quite a lot of muscle mass underneath the fat but I din't take diet and training too serious and that is why I didn't look my best! This is my calisthenics journey and it truly made the difference in my life!

**Stats:**

Age: 26

**Height: 1.89m/6'2 ft.**

**Weight:** 

**- Before 114kg/250lbs** 

**- After    95kg/207lbs**

&#x200B;

**Progress in strength and endurance:**

Pull-ups: 2 to 21 body weight and +51kg/112lbs x1

Chin-ups: 5 to 21 and +62kg/136lbs x1

Dips: 9 to 35 body weight and +72kg/158lbs x1

Pull overs: 1 to not exactly sure haven't tested my max but at least 12 reps

**Muscle-Ups: 0 to 12**

I've learned archer push-ups and pull-ups

I've learned one arm push-ups

I've mastered pull-overs

I've mastered L-Sit and hanging leg raise in 90 degree angle for couple of seconds

Yes most of the stats are like in the last post but I do have a lot of improvements which in my opinion is what is important! Progress is what makes me love doing what I do! 

For example I did chin-ups PB, mastered L-sit with straight legs and toes pointing forward etc.

**Note:** My form may not be perfect yet for muscle-ups but in my opinion progressing and improving is what counts! Also if we consider how hard it's for heavier guys to do muscle-ups I think anyone can forgive some kip in last couple reps... but in time I will do them clean believe me! 

It was the same with pull-ups people called me out on the form and still do in my old videos, but right now my pull-up form is great so It's just matter of time and the same case will be for muscle-ups!

**A little more information about my previous background:** I trained in power lifting so basically a lot of focus was on me doing bench press, squats and deadlift for three reps and 3 sets. I liked the workouts but it's also quite dangerous so you have to be careful and always train without the ego! 

This post is to motivate other big guys who have quite a lot of mass they are packing or are tall and think calisthenics isn't for them! I am example that if you really want to do calisthenics your height and weight doesn't matter that much. Yes It may take insane time to learn things like straddle planche etc. but it's not always about those exercises. You can thrive in others fundamental exercises and set good example for people around you! 

If anyone is interested in seeing my journey just type ElvisLifts on Google/Youtube and you will find me. Everything I say and claim is on video so I don't make these numbers just up from thin air.

"Bodyweight strength training programs in Google Sheets with videos & progression guides included - 2-4x week Fullbody, Upper/lower and bodypart splits",TwoWorkOuts,2579,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/l97qyy/bodyweight_strength_training_programs_in_google/,1612079738.0,"I've been using different training apps for years now but they all have had some features that I didn't quite like. First of all I like that my information is available without being depended on 3rd party software and support for your device. This has happened few times where the support for the workout app ended and I could not get to my workout history or programs anymore. 

Yeah I know google drive is just another service provider but most likely you will not lose your data over night when the developers decide to stop supporting latest operating system.

Ads are just super annoying especially during a workout you might accidentally click on an ad. Also the progression ladder for different bodyweight exercises was not very clear and I like that my exercises are listed in difficulty order.

I have also seen a lot of different excel files that are good but don't fully do the job. They were missing some features such as customization of exercises and editing the programs.

So I decided to make a better google sheets file that had most of the features I needed (customization, tracking and no scripts). I made this for myself originally but I thought that with some extra work it could be a useful template for anyone who is looking on how to build strength with bodyweight training. So this is aimed for beginners and intermediates who are looking on how to start and progress with their bodyweight strenght training.

Since all the exercises are categorized, videos on the exercises are included and guides to each progression is available making progress could not be easier ;)

What it includes:

\-Pre made bodyweight strength training programs based on 2-4x week Fullbody, Upper/lower and bodypart splits

\-Customizable workout template with up to 4 work out days a week

\-One finger logging with mobile phone

\-Guides included to each progression

\-Video links included to each exercise

\-You can add custom exercises to list

\-Training block length 5-12weeks

\-Tracking sheet that counts total number of reps done in a workout and highlights the rep count with green if you made progress. If you performed less reps the cell will turn red.

\-Planning sheet calculates the training volume for each muscle group for you

\-All features implemented with basic sheet functions. No scripts used so it is safe to use and requires no special permissions.

\-By default exercises selected to fit intermediate strength level. Go up or down in the progression and select the exercises according to your strength level.

It took me years to put all this together and I am excited to share it with you today.

The data is organized in a way to help people find answers to common questions, which I sometimes see on this subreddit, such as:

* Which beginner exercises can I do with this piece of equipment?
* What are easier/harder variations of this exercise?
* How can I strengthen or stretch this muscle?
* What parts of the body does this exercise work?
* What logical progressions will lead me to this awesome skill?

You can search by name, find lists of exercises by muscle group, joint movement and possible equipment. The exercises are linked to each other through skill trees and similarity. You can also explore categories such as ""Animal walk"" or ""Inversions"". And about 950 of the exercises have a demonstration video.

Please try it out and let me know what you think!

EDIT: There seems to be sometimes issues when running in a mobile phone browser. I'll look into it but meanwhile I'd suggest you use the mobile app instead, which includes the same search function as the website, and use the website on desktop.

EDIT 2: Thank you all for your amazing support and encouragement! I'll keep working hard to make this tool even better. The performance when running on mobile should already be better now and I also fixed an issue with the video player that was giving an error when refreshing an exercise datasheet page.

EDIT 3: The Advanced Filter is there! This was the most requested feature in this thread. You can now filter exercises by combining any objective, muscle or joint, equipment, difficulty, and whether it's static, dynamic, explosive, unilateral or bilateral."

I got 11 pullups in a row when I was aiming for 10!,Ineedatutorstat,2479,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hf96yw/i_got_11_pullups_in_a_row_when_i_was_aiming_for_10/,1593031793.0,"I wanted to achieve 10 pullups because it’s a nice, round and even number. Then I’m able to do a simple 3x5 weighted pullup routine without exactly going to failure. Grease the Groove is the program I used to get this number since all the others didn’t work for me. This link explains it better than I ever can: https://humanmachine.wordpress.com/2007/06/22/grease-the-groove-for-strength/

I couldn’t do any pullups in the beginning so I started doing assisted pullups(I used the assistance machine) and negatives. Negatives are where you lower yourself slowly from the top, it’s really good for building fast-twitch muscle fibers and getting that power and strength needed to get the first pullup. Because naturally, if you can’t do any pullups strength is an issue. I couldn’t properly control the negative standing at the edge of a box near a pullup bar so I just opted for jumping pullups to get myself in the position for the negative. I would hold at the top for a few seconds to get control, and then slowly lower myself for a few seconds.If you can’t do any negatives at all, I would just focus on getting better at holding onto the bar. If you can’t hang on to the bar at all, you should probably do some lat pulldowns.

I didn’t really linearly progress the assisted pullups and negatives. For some reason, the assisted machine didn’t really scale right. 40 lbs of assistance felt much harder than 50 lbs of assistance even given the 10 lbs difference. And if I went up fast enough, the assistance machine would momentarily not be helping at all. If I could go back, I would just use assistance bands as they seem to feel more natural. So I just picked a number where I can do them with good form( I think 100 lbs was the number I used) and increased volume per week, as in more sets and reps. . Once I started adding volume, it ended up getting me from 0 pullups to 1 pullup very quickly. From there, I was just doing sets of 1 pullup all the time.

I didn’t do pullups literally every time I went to the basement(I rarely go there) or bathroom etc but I did try to space it out over the course of the day. For example if I got back from a walk, I would do a set. With the exception of the 9-pullup RM test, I never approached failure. That said, I did get a little fatigued sometimes but as long as most sets felt easy it never seemed to be a problem. That’s a point I was thinking about last night: If you’re getting better on your pullup tests, do you actually need to go to failure? If I go from 4-5 pullups and still leave a rep in the tank, does it hurt my progress? Does going to failure hurt gains in the long-run? Is it better to test every 2 weeks rather than one? Yet I think testing is still necessary, if only for the psychological benefit. 3 pullups gotta feel easy if you can do 6 pullups. My pullup log: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2TC-6a8Aj1uaBYezJbItTTXf7atloO8Ywc7E8MvgAChDi393vwiK7SsrEUsq_h525Fyq1ZxV4lB-s/pub

The hardest thing about pullups wasn’t the pullups or even the diet. It was the absolute boredom. It was a chore doing pullups every day, I’d sit there, thinking “it’s probably time to do a set” after a study session. If I could do pullups once a year and magically get better, I would do that. Doing weighted pullups gives me an excuse to do them 3 times a week. It seems like if you can manage the discipline, GTG can quickly improve your pullup numbers. I’ve been doing pullups on and off for years, and I can’t remember why I decided on 4 sets, if only because it was necessary to work, or if 5 sets was too much.Would I have gotten gains faster if I did more sets or less? I don’t really know. But it worked, so I guess “don’t break something that’s fixed”. If I could start over, I would try doing 2 sets a day because at least those 2 sets can be fresh as possible. 

For diet, I started off as fat at 5’11 200 lbs, 27M and dieted to 140 lbs and then over the course of this routine gained 5 lbs to try to build muscle. Before quarantine, I did Jacked and Tan 2.0. @200 lbs, I found my maintenance calories to be 3500. I made sure to get 0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight and 0.4 grams of fat per pound of bodyweight (so for me it was 160 grams of protein and 80grams of fat) and put the rest of the calories in carbs. Then I did a 500 call deficit, eating 3000 calories per day. I only dropped calories  by 100 if I wasn't losing weight at all for a week. This slow approach was so I didn't get too hungry for school. Eventually I dropped it to 1500 calories. With the exception of chicken to get protein, and healthy fats like peanut butter, olive oil etc to reach my fat intake, I pretty much ate whatever I wanted following IIFYM. IIFYM was a godsend for me, making it much easier for me to stick to this diet. I also used intermittent fasting because 1 meal a day is really satiating.  This took me a few years. 

Methods to stave off hunger were copious amounts of diet coke, gum and vegetables.

I will admit that losing weight made pullups so much easier, it’s crazy how much easier it makes it. Other lifts didn’t really change much depending on if I gained/lost weight. My lats didn’t really get any bigger. I guess it wasn’t enough time for them to grow? I suspect weighted pullups are better for lat-development anyway. I experienced some elbow tendonitis in the later weeks so I looked at diet and added some protein since it was a shitty diet. I don’t think you need a perfect diet to get better at pullups as long as you’re not overweight and aren’t getting injured anyway. My sleep was fine, it wasn’t great but it wasn’t terrible either .For the future, the primary goal is: Do a pullup with 45 lbs. Secondary goal: See how it affects my bodyweight pullups. 

TL;DR: Do more pullups to get better at pullups. You don’t need to do a lot, just a few good sets will work and frequency is likely more important than volume.

Edit: I expanded more on the diet approach."
/r/bodyweightfitness will be going dark starting June 12th in protest against Reddit's API changes,SomethingsAwry,2466,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1430zg1/rbodyweightfitness_will_be_going_dark_starting/,1686105445.0,"Hello everyone!

I'm sure many of you have heard by now, but an upcoming Reddit policy change regarding the API is incoming. This change will permanently cripple third-party apps unless they pay an exorbitant, unreasonable, amount of money for API access. This includes Apollo and RedditIsFun, along with many other apps most of us use in our day-to-day browsing. In addition to killing off these apps, this would render many third-party tools and programs unusable, including tools that simplify moderation or even assist low-vision users in actually being able to access the site. If you've ever had the displeasure of downloading the official app and attempting to use it, Reddit's official app lacks much functionality, making even basic browsing of Reddit a chore, not to mention moderation.

/r/bodyweightfitness will be going dark on June 12th, along with [many other subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/). Some subs will be going dark for 48 hours, while others will be going dark PERMANENTLY until this situation is adequately addressed. We're planning on starting at 48 hours and re-evaluating from there. As much of the subreddit's information is located on the wiki, blocking access to the subreddit will prevent users from accessing the routines. Luckily, we have a solution via the Wayback Machine:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20230605173203/https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index/](https://web.archive.org/web/20230605173203/https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index/)

This link will be posted in the description when the server goes dark, so that anyone browsing at that time may still access the routines we know and love. Additionally, information about the Discord will be available within that same message.

So, what can you do?  
  
1. Complain. Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site. Message /u/reddit. Submit a support request. Comment in relevant threads regarding the blackout. Leave a negative review on the official Reddit iOS or Android app.  
  
2. Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Ask the mods if they're planning on closing down the subreddit if you haven't seen any posts relating to it yet.  
  
3. Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th and pay a visit to a Reddit alternative.  
  
4. Don't be a jerk. As upsetting as this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible. This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part.

We hope this change isn't pushed through, especially with the massive community pushback Reddit is receiving. During this time, [the Discord will still be available, so stop on by!](https://discord.com/invite/bwf)"

Then I watched Jeremy Ethier's video on pull-ups followed his routine and two weeks later I did one!! It's literally the best feeling in the world. I can only do one right now, but I'm gonna try and get up to 5. I never thought I would ever get this much satisfaction from exercise."
Once per week is so much better than nothing - you WILL see progress,jarofjellyfish,2439,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gnys4f/once_per_week_is_so_much_better_than_nothing_you/,1590074444.0,"Long time lurker, thought I'd throw my 2 cents in for people staring at an hour+ full body work out x3 like it's an impassible wall.    
    
I know the minimalist routine is designed to address this, but I think beating inertia is a stumbling block for a lot of people. The ""I don't have this much time"" section of the RR recommends dropping exercises, but in reality dropping full work outs is much more likely to get some people started.    
I see a surprising number of ""can I get away with once per week?"" posts. Anything is better than nothing. You WILL see improvement doing a RR workout just once per week, as long as you put in the work and make sure you are progressing.    
    
I climb, hike, and play hockey so I get plenty of exercise, and really just do the RR for injury prevention. I tend to only squeeze one, rarely two, BW workouts in per week, sometimes not even that, and sometimes I get lazy and don't even do all the exercises. Would I have better results following the RR religiously? Yes, undoubtedly. Am I a lazy excuse maker? Also yes.    
Despite this, I've managed to go from basically the lowest progression of every exercise to PPPU, heavily weighted pullups, pistol squats, nordic curls, etc, all in the space of around a year and a half. Since covid dropped, my roughly 5x/month RR habit has stayed the same, and despite losing out on the rest of the exercise I normally get, I'm still seeing the same slow steady progress.    
    
All this to say, if the RR 3x per week is daunting, if even the minimalist routine seems like too much, forcing yourself to do just one RR workout per week can still have tremendous results. That's only 2hrs once per week. That's NOTHING. Just do the thing. Too lazy saturday morning? Do it sunday. Blew the whole weekend? Do it Tuesday. Beating inertia just a single time per week is child's play, treat it like doing your taxes or brushing your teeth. Don't rely on motivation, be disciplined. If you're feeling motivated then throw in an extra workout, but the baseline should be a disciplined 1x week minimum.    
    
I'm sure the beginner gains will dry up eventually and I'll see less progress, but even getting to this point has had a huge impact on my various joint pains, vastly improved my physique (I'm no longer a skinnyfat string bean), and had a noticeable effect on my general athleticism. Probably the single biggest positive impact on my life. It never feels like any progress whatsoever day-to-day, but when you start to look at it over years even slow progress has a huge effect.  
    
PS: don't be so damn lazy and do it 3x per week, you'll feel better and get to laugh disdainfully at my progress like a buff and chiselled demi-god."
"Training at home but don't have access to a pullup bar or rings? I put together a list of 26 at-home pull up alternative back exercises that require minimal equipment (including row progressions, isometrics, banded exercises and more).

The good news is that there are plenty of at-home back exercises you can do with little to no equipment.

# A few notes:

Although I've listed 26 back exercises below, I'm not suggesting you should incorporate all of them, all of the time. Less is more - ideally, you'd pick 1-2 exercises and progressively overload over time. But it's nice to have options in case of limitations.

**My preference is to use the row and/or a weighted progression as the main pull exercises,** typically working at 3 sets of 5-8 repetitions, with the primary goal of building strength. Get comfortable with 3 sets of 8 before experimenting with the next progression.

**The isometrics and banded exercises are there as extra options** if you don't have access to a stable rowing surface or weights**,** or if you just want to mix things up a bit / add more volume. I would perform them for higher reps (\~12), or at a slower tempo for more time under tension. You won't develop crazy feats of strength with them, but they can be useful for supporting joint health, improving posture, and potentially even building muscle.

**Not sure how to get started?** 

If you're just new to home training, you don't have a home pull up bar, and you're not sure where to start in terms of incorporating a back / pulling exercise into your routine, I use the following format:

* **Exercise 1:** Lower body hinge/squat movement. *3 sets of 5-8 reps*
* **Exercise 2:** Upper body push movement. *3 sets of 5-8 reps*
* **Exercise 3:** Upper body pull (back) movement. *3 sets of 5-8 reps*

I perform two different sessions with the same basic structure as above.

* **In session 1**, I perform a squat variation, a vertical push, and then a horizontal pull (typically a bodyweight row). 
* **For session 2**, I use a hinge progression, a horizontal push, and for now the *same horizontal pull as session 1 to keep things simple*.

From my experience, most people can benefit from doing more horizontal pulling work to combat the rounded posture encourage by modern-day living. So more volume gives you a chance to address any potential imbalances there.

If you have any questions at all, feel free to leave a comment below and I'll get back to you. 

Happy training!

# 7 Row Progressions

*As I touched on above, my preference is to use the row progressions as my primary back exercise. You'll just need a sturdy table, two chairs, or railings for the intermediate progressions (beyond the towel row). I would shoot for 3 comfortable sets of 8 before moving up to the next exercise. Elevated feet and then front lever rows would be the next progression after number 5-7, but they may be unsafe if you're using a home setup, hence why I left them out.* 

**1. Towel Row**

If you have a sturdy door or an upright, the towel row is a great option for working the mid back. Attach the towel to the door handle or upright, then:

* Brace through the core and activate the glutes (so the spine moves as one unit).
* Initiate the pull from your mid back, as opposed to your arms. 
* Aim to pull your elbows past your torso (keeping them as close to your body as you can). 
* Think about pinching your shoulder blades back and down as you pull.

**2. Incline Towel Row**

To progress the towel row, simply decrease the angle between your back and the floor. 

Again, maintain tension throughout the midsection, keep those elbows in close and pinch your shoulder blades together.

**3. One Arm Towel Row**

When you've mastered the incline towel row (you can comfortably perform 3 sets of 8 repetitions), experiment with the one-arm version. The cues are the same, but it becomes more important to stabilise through the core to resist rotation.

**4. Horizontal Row / Australian Pull Up** 

The horizontal row is typically performed using gymnastic rings attached to a pull up bar, or on a barbell in a rack. 

If those aren't available when training your back at home, you can still perform the movement if you have access to two sturdy chairs, a table or some railings.

***To progress the horizontal row further, you can straighten and elevate the legs onto another chair/bench. I've not included it in this guide as I personally don't have access to a sturdy enough setup right now. The following are alternatives if you're in the same boat and can't raise the legs or begin working on front lever progressions.***

**5. Weighted Horizontal Row**

If you have a backpack and some weights (or a load of tinned food) you can progress the horizontal row by adding weight.

**6. One Leg Horizontal Row**

This wouldn't be my go-to, but if you're without weights and want to add some anti-rotation into your rows, you can play with lifting one leg off the floor.

**7. Archer Row**

If weights aren't available, you can progress your rows by pulling more towards one arm at a time with archer rows.

Not pictured due to equipment limitations, but if you have a super sturdy setup you can really shift the weight towards one side at a time, straightening the opposite arm completely. This is a great way to highlight and address any imbalances.

# 8 Isometric & Lower Back Exercises

*These isometric and lower back exercises can be useful if you don't have access to a sturdy place to row and/or weights. As I touched on earlier, I would perform them for higher reps (\~12), or at a slower tempo for more time under tension. You won't develop crazy feats of strength with them, but they can be useful for supporting joint health, improving posture, mitigating back pain and even building muscle.*

**8. Hinged Isometrics**

A hip hinge can be an effective way to strengthen both the lower and mid back to support posture. I like spending a few breaths in three different positions:

* **T-Rex** \- elbows in close, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Optional roaring.
* **The W** \- scooping the elbows, down, forward and under (externally rotating at the shoulder).
* **Overhead** \- trying to keep the arms straight and bring them past the ears.

**9. Wall Slides**

The wall slide is a great exercise for correcting forward head posture and rounded shoulders.

* With your heels a few inches away from the wall, press your bum, lower back, mid back and head against the wall, bracing the core and tucking the chin slightly. 
* With the arms in contact with the wall, slide them from a W shape by your side, to straight up overhead. 
* **Maintain that contact with the wall (including your low back) throughout the movement.**
* You may need to step your feet a little further away from the wall if maintaining contact with the back proves too difficult at first.

**10. Wall Row**

This wouldn't necessarily be one of my go-to exercises, but it can be useful for a complete beginner, someone with no access to equipment, or someone who wants to feel what it means to activate their mid back.

With the elbows against the wall and close to the body, you're going to drive them into the wall, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Your chest will come off the wall, and you can hold this end range position for 5-10 seconds at a time for sets of 10-12 reps. 

**11. Floor Elbow Row**

This is the same as the above, except using the floor as the platform to push off. Gravity makes it a little harder than using the wall. 

**12. Reverse Hyper**

A highly regarded exercise for strengthening the lower back and glutes. Find a sturdy stool or a big pile of cushions. With your core braced and your pelvis in a posterior pelvic tilt, lift the legs up off the floor, extending at the knees and hips.

You can hold at the top position for a set amount of time, opt for repetitions, or a combination of both.

**13. Floor Pull Up**

This is perhaps the most 'out there' exercise on the list, and not one I would typically go to. But if you don't have a home pull up bar or, anywhere to row, or something heavy, but you do have a nice shiny floor, the floor pull up can be a decent way to activate the lats, and to some extent the mid back.

Starting prone with the arms overhead, keep your forearms planted and squeeze your shoulder blades back and down to pull your torso towards your hands. Squeeze at the top position for a few seconds, before pushing back to the start. 

**14. Superman**

The superman can be a useful drill for activating the back body - handy if you're working towards any backbends like the bridge or wheel. 

A few important cues:

Try to keep the tailbone tucked under (activating the glutes) to take strain off the lower back. Also avoid craning the neck up when you rise - look down at the ground or ever so slightly ahead of you.

**15. Bird Dog**

The bird-dog is a great core exercise for working on the oblique slings (something I'm looking to cover in more detail soon).

From all fours, stay stable through the midline and lift the opposite arm and leg. You're looking to minimise any rotation through the shoulders and pelvis, as well as any arching through the low back.

# 5 Weighted Back Exercises

*Although we'd ideally perform the following with dumbbells or kettlebells, with some creativity you can come up with a decent temporary alternative. Suitcases, heavy backpacks, water bottles, bulk bags of rice, sandbags, and rocks can all work fairly well (just be safe). Like the row progressions, I'd work with with 3 sets of 5-8 (potentially 8-12 if a higher load isn't available).*  

**16. Lat Pullover**

The lat pullover is one of my favourite back exercises for improving overhead mobility. It's also a decent way to strengthen the lats and serratus anterior, making it a decent pullup alternative with dumbbells. 

Find yourself a sturdy surface, press a weight out in front of you, and then maintaining straight arms, slowly lower overhead. You'll feel a nice stretch on the lats, before bringing it back to centre.

**17. Bent Over Row**

The bent over row is an excellent way to build a strong, muscular mid back. 

Hinge from the hips, stay stable through the core, and keep the elbows in close as you squeeze the shoulder blades together, guiding the weight to just below your sternum. 

*Not pictured: if you have access to 2 weights of the same size, I'd opt for a double bent over row for increased range of motion.* 

**18. Single Arm Bent Over Row**

The single arm version allows you to load up the weight, increase range of motion and also get a little rotation through the thoracic spine.

Just be sure to keep the core braced and avoid rounding (hunching) through the mid back. 

**19. Kettlebell Swing**

If I had to pick one exercise for building a combination of strength, power, endurance, and all round athleticism, it may well be the kettlebell swing. I like using sets of 10 for swings, and unlike most of the other back exercises listed, I do them on a separate day to my normal strength workout, incorporating them into more of a conditioning-foccussed routine.

A few important points to keep in mind:

* The primary movement with the kettlebell swing is a hip hinge - most of the motion occurs at the hips, as opposed the knees (as you'd see in a squat).
* Keep your core braced throughout the movement so the spine moves as one unit. This includes the neck - avoid craning the head up to look forward in the bottom position.
* The shoulders stay packed or locked back and down throughout.
* Drive with your hips, squeezing the glutes through the upward phase of the movement, but not overextending at the top (ribs stay down like you're in a plank position).
* The arms are like ropes extending from the body. They don't do the lifting, they just transfer the force from your hips.
* The feet stay firmly planted with the arches lifted. External rotation into the floor helps to create torque and keep the knees safe. 

**20. Single Arm Kettlebell Swing**

Although you may not be able to generate quite as much power with the single arm kettlebell swing, it does add another dynamic in the form of anti-rotation through the core. You'll have to work hard to stop your upper body rotating as you swing, and to keep the shoulder loaded into the socket.

# 5 Back Exercises With Resistance Bands

*Although it's not easy to get a complete pull up alternative with resistance bands, they do open up a range of options. Resistance bands seem to be some of the few home fitness items that haven't sold out at the time of writing. They're inexpensive and useful for building power, shoulder prehab and more.*

**21. Band Pull Aparts**

A great prehab / warmup drill for activating the rear delts, lower traps and rhomboids. 

Start by holding the band out in front of you horizontally. Allow the shoulders to protract in the first position, then keeping the arms straight, pull them back and down (retract and depress) to finish the movement. Think about squeezing a penny between your shoulder blades. 

**22. Face Pulls**

The face pull is one of my favourites for all round shoulder health. I usually do them with cables or gymnastic rings, but a band can work well too.

Setup the anchor point at head height or just above (you may need to kneel on the floor for this). Start by pulling the band towards your face, and when your hands are an inch or two from hitting you, externally rotate through the shoulders, keeping the elbows high.

In the finish position, you should feel like the shoulder blades are scooping back and under. I like to hold for a few seconds in this position before continuing. 

**23. Banded Twist Row**

The banded row is a great drill for activating the posterior oblique sling - the connection between the glute and lat on the opposite sides. 

This connection is crucial for all kinds of athletic movement patterns, including running, swimming, throwing, and many more. It's a little difficult to describe without a video or imagery, but I'll give it a go:

* Setup your anchor point around the middle of the ribcage height. 
* You start with the right hand and right leg forward, with some tension on the band.
* With a nice upright posture, set the right shoulder back and down, and at the same time activate the left glute.
* Your then going to pull with your right side, bracing through the core, keeping the left glute activated and rotating through the thoracic spine, allowing the neck and head to follow.
* Hold at the end range for a few breaths or return to the start position and perform repetitions. 

**24. Dynamic Twist Row**

Here we add some explosive movement to the above banded twist row, which I feel has more transfer over to athletic movement patterns.

* This time you start with the opposite leg and arm forward.
* As you pull with your arm, you step back with the opposite leg, activating that glute as you land on the ball of your foot.
* You can send the opposite arm forward in a counter-movement as you step back.
* Again, try to stay stable through the core and pelvis, and nice and upright through the torso.

**25. Seated Row**

If you have a strong upright and some heavy resistance bands, the seated row is a great option. Just like the bodyweight rows, stay stable through the midsection, pull the elbows past the body and squeeze those shoulders back and down.

**26. One Arm Seated Row**

As above, but you're forced to be more mindful of your core as you resist rotation. Not a bad option if you start to run out of band resistance for the two arm version.

"Everyone tells you that flared elbows are bad, when you do Push Ups. No one explains why. Here's a video I made for you, with the medical explanation in great detail.",tykato,2420,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4wfh6i/everyone_tells_you_that_flared_elbows_are_bad/,1470481574.0,"# Video: https://youtu.be/5L4kdK-vqBY (Maybe NSFW, Swearing)

Hey athletes of /r/bodyweightfitness,

have you ever been told, that flaring your elbows in Push Ups is wrong and you should stop doing it? The person who told you so probably didn't explain *why* you should stop doing this.

Today I've recorded a video about it, to explain to you what's happening when you flare your elbows, and why it leads to a painful disease called Impingement Syndrome.

If you don't want to watch the video, here's the tl;dr:

* Normally, the tendon of your supraspinatus muscle is protected by a small soft tissue sac called bursa.
* Abduction (side levering) of the arm over 70° degrees, causes your supraspinatus tendon to rub against the bony structure of your shoulder roof (acromion), instead of your bursa.
* This is a normal process in everyday life and does not induce problems normally.
* By putting lots of load on the supraspinatus tendon without the bursa protecting your tendon (e.g. in wide pushups), you are damaging the tendon tissue and the surrounding structures.
* Doing this for a longer period of time leads to inflammation, degeneration of tissue and the Impingement Syndrome, where lifting your arm sideways causes pain. (Also called Painful Arc).
* This heals with scar tissue, impeding the function of your shoulder strength permanently (and it takes a long time to build back).

If you have ever been injured from doing too many push ups wrong, please feel free to share your story!

**PS: Please spread the word. Share this video with your friends, when they do Push Ups wrong.**

We keep pretty close tabs on what he watches, but I know we don't see everything he sees. I noticed him watching Chris Heria earlier tonight, and now he wants a $70 windbreaker from his website. 🙄

I don't do much in the way of lifting or bodyweight fitness myself, but I looked into Heria and it looks like he's more of a YouTuber than a reputable fitness instructor. We're planning to get my son a gym pass soon, and his uncle has taught him lifting techniques, but he's unfortunately getting a lot of his ideas of what is ""cool"" and ""masculine"" from flashy dudebros on the internet. I'm not naive enough to think that restricting his access will be a perfect solution, so if anyone has some channels I can check out that will scratch that itch to watch jacked-up men lifting for inspiration, while also actually demonstrating good form, I would really appreciate it. Bonus points if they're not hawking overpriced athleisure wares and acting like fuckbois.

For the first time in months I had gone out to see friends since quarantine is being eased where I lived. Was wearing a somewhat tight shirt, which brought out definition in my body. First when I met my friends they noticed that I was a lot more muscular than they expected me to be. And when I got home, my mom said she was proud of me, and the hard work I put into my body. Her being proud of me makes me even more prideful in my own progress. It encouraged me even more to continue calisthenics, and im loving it.

But yesterday a coworker I haven't seen in person in about 6 months told me I ""look fit as hell"" and asked me what I had been doing. As someone who went from being the scrawny kid to skinny fat adult, I've never been complimented on my physical fitness before in my life. Feels pretty good.

Suspect that you have rounded shoulders? I wrote a guide on how you can test and fix them!,airawear,2252,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5wltkn/suspect_that_you_have_rounded_shoulders_i_wrote_a/,1488254971.0,"Hey peeps of r/bodyweightfitness, 

Some of us have been hunching forward for a huge part of our lives because of the way we work. This is especially so if you have been working in front of the computer for a large part of your life (studying, working, playing games etc.) 

As a result of this hunching, you may have developed rounded shoulders, causing your posture to be hunched forward. 

In this post, I am going to share with you how you can test yourself to find out if you have rounded shoulders -- and also how to fix it. 

**Two Tests To See If You Have Rounded Shoulders**

**Method 1: Inward Shoulder Rotation** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/SimilarDownrightButterfly)

**Step 1:** Stand as how you normally do. Arms down.

**Step 2:** With your hands by your side, notice your thumbs – are your thumbnails pointing forward, parallel to each other? Or are they non-parallel? What angle are your thumbs forming right now?

Make a mental note and remember how your thumbs look like based on their angles. You have rounded shoulders if your thumbs are “naturally” pointed towards each other (i.e not parallel.)

**Method 2: Tight Chest, Weak Shoulders** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/KaleidoscopicDentalAmericankestrel)

**Step 1:** Get a good look at your side profile (take a picture if you have to, or turn 90 degrees to either left or right). If you can’t get a picture, see step 2.

**Step 2:** Observe your cheekbone-collarbone alignment. Simply draw a vertical line down from your cheekbone. Does this line hit your collarbone? Or is it in front of the collarbone?

You have rounded shoulders if your cheekbone is ahead of your collarbone. 

At this stage, if you do not have rounded shoulders, or are perfectly healthy, congrats! If not, you might want to consider doing the below exercises regularly to help fix it. 

**1. Floor Angels** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/EasygoingCelebratedBrownbear)

*Step-by-Step Guide:*

* Lie in a prone position, arms extended forward (like Superman)
* Gently raise your arms off the ground, and bring your elbows as close to your waist as possible
* Your hands should remain parallel and facing the front at all times
* Bring down your arms
* Lift them up and bring them back to the Superman position
* Repeat for 15 reps, 5 seconds per rep

**2. Wall Slides** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/AmusedClutteredBonobo)

*Step-by-Step Guide:*

* Stand shoulder width apart, with full body contact against the wall (ankle, butt cheeks, shoulder blades, deltoids AND back of head)
* Bring your elbows, wrists and back of hands up and against the wall, forming an L shape with your arms
* Without losing ANY wall contact, slide your arms up and hold them up
* Slowly slide back down
* Repeat for 10 reps, 3 seconds per rep (up and down counts as 1 rep)

**3. Wide Superman** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/ClearDecentFlies)

*Step-by-Step Guide:*

* Lie in a prone position, facing the floor
* With arms extend to the side, raise your chest, arms and abs away from the floor
* Repeat for 10 reps, 3 seconds per rep

**4. Wall Corner Stretch** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/ShadowyReasonableFoxhound)

*Step-by-Step Guide:*

* Find a corner in the room (or an open door)
* Stand about 1 to 2 feet away from the corner or doorframe
* With arms straightened and parallel to the ground, place your palms against the surface of the walls or door
* Lean forward and bring your chest and head out as far as possible
* Hold for 30 seconds

**5. Cobra Pose** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/HoarseLongBellsnake)

*Step-by-Step Guide:*

* Lie in prone position, facing down
* Bring palms next to your chest, as if you’re about to do a push up
* Extend and straighten your arms, while relaxing your body from the abs and below
* Tilt your neck back as far as you can as you extend and straighten your arms
* Repeat for 10 reps, 3 seconds per rep

Hope this has been helpful! Let me know where I can improve!

If you you're not fit (like I used to be sooo long time in completly different shapes) it's completly normal to hate Calishtenics and fitness in general. I used to hate it, but pushed myself into new limits until I reached a point where pushups become easy, and after that even fun. Pull ups became fun, all the basics became fun, doing new stuff is fun, because you'll feel extremely better in your body. Trust the progress and trust me when I say, that you'll eventually fall in love with any kind of fitness once you become good in it. Don't say fitness isn't for you, because you don't have fun doing it. The fun is not the beginning and sometimes even not the fitness itself, but the reflection in the mirror you finally like, the new move you can show to your family, the feeling of relieve after you know you did the right thing.

My chest won’t go as low without my back bending. So I had to do wall push-ups. Then i did elevated push-ups. After that I was able to do full range of motion push-ups from my knees. The last three months, I’ve been putting pillows underneath my chest and doing push-ups from my toes, just to touch that pillow. But then finally, I am able to do the push-ups with straight back, engaged core and full range of motion. I’m so proud of myself. :)"

Well, I tried this and I instantly went from 3 measly push ups to 9 correct push ups with no pain, and finally felt my chest working for the first time. I'm sure this is common knowledge to alot of you in this sub but this was never pointed out to me even through all my searching and it could be the reason alot of others can't do push ups."

# What the routine is

It is a full body bodyweight training session for beginners. It should take 30-60min to complete and should be done 2 or 3 times a week. The exercises presented are **milestones,** the point is to give beginners **clear objectives to reach**. If you cannot perform an exercise, no worries, just scale down and look at the How to scale down section below.

It is divided in 4 sections with a total of 10 exercises equally splitted in dynamic and static:

* **Core Strength** (3 exercises): aims at building fundamental core strength (spine + hip) in core flexors, extensors, abductors and adductors
   * This will later be required for the Front Lever, Back Lever/Planche and Lateral Lever
* **Straight Arm Strength** (2 exercises): aims at building fundamental 180° shoulder flexion strength along with scapular elevation/protraction, and 90° shoulder extension strength along with scpular depression/retraction
   * This will later be required for the Handstand variations and Manna variations
* **Bent Arm Strength** (2 exercises): aims at building fundamental pushing and pulling BAS
   * This will later be required for major BAS exercises like Dips, Pull-Ups, Muscle-Ups, HSPU...
* **Leg Strength** (3 exercises):  aims at building fundamental strength in hip, knee and foot muscles
   * This will later be required for Pistol Squat, Single Leg Glute Bridge Curl, Dumbell Walking Lunge, Weighted Squat, Deadlift...

# What makes this routine different than most routines in the internet

* Simple exercises (as opposed to complex) - simple does NOT mean easy
* Carefully selected exercises which will ALL be beneficial in the short, middle and long term as they will carryover to more advanced exercises
* Holistic strength development: Core, SAS, BAS, Legs
* Hypertrophy: it works all the muscles in your body and the muscles worked are explained for each exercise, you can have more details on ExRx if you want more details.
* The routine is intrinsically balanced from a biomechanical perspective. No obsessive focus on abs and hip flexors!
* Helps to build WORK CAPACITY: which is crucial if you want to step up your game by increasing volume in the long term
* Avoid common mistakes thanks to dedicated tips for each exercise

# What this routine is not

* Does not include a detailed warm-up: with all the resources available in 2018 I do not think that I have a huge added value here, just warm-up for 10-15min with common exercises: joints circumduction/circles, slow running, jumping jack...
* Does not include dedicated mobility work: if you want to go further, you will have to complement this training session with some mobility work to maximize your gains. Please look at Tom Merrick's excellent video about loaded mobility on YouTube
* Does not include a specific repetitions plan to reach the targets. Just build up to the target and figure out the number of reps you are currently able to perform properly in a given set!
* A routine which does not require any equipment: you will need to find something to perform the Horizontal Pull-Ups

# How to perform the routine

The goal is to perform all the exercises as a local circuit in a given training session. You should only split the routine in exceptional circumstances: you do not have time to perform all the exercises or you are too weak yet. Please note that there is a clear intent to build work capacity so do not give up too easily!

* Warm-up (10-15min)
* Rest 1 minute
* Perform Core Strength exercises as a local circuit: Front Body Hold > Back Body Hold > Lateral Body Hold > Rest 1 minute > Repeat until you do 4 sets of each exercise
* Rest 1 minute
* Perform SAS exercises as a local circuit: Tuck Closed Shoulder Support > Tuck Open Shoulder Support > Rest 1 minute > Repeat until you do 4 sets of each exercise
* Rest 1 minute
* Perform BAS exercises as a local circuit: Horizontal Push-Up > Horizontal Pull-Up > Rest 1 minute > Repeat until you do 4 sets of each exercise
* Reste 1 minute
* Perform LS exercises a local circuit: Squat > Glute Bridge Curl > Split Squat > Rest 1 minute > Repeat until you do 4 sets of each exercise

Total time: usually 30-60min

# How to scale down if an exercise if too difficult/how to build up to an exercise

* Core Strength exercises:
   * Tuck or straddle your legs
   * For Back Body Hold, a very good way to build up to this exercise is to perform Hyperextensions and Reverse Hyperextension
* Straight Arm Strength exercises
   * Tuck or straddle your legs
   * You are free to use small parallets if you cannot handle the wrist extension pressure yet
   * Use an elevated surface for your hands in the Tuck Closed Shoulder Support
   * Place your hands further from the wall in the Tuck Open Shoulder Support
* Bent Arm Strength exercises
   * Elevate your hands and perform these exercises diagonally or vertically in the worst cases
* Leg Strength exercises
   * For the Squat and Split Squat the best way to scale down is to use your hands to assist yourself by grabbing something
   * For the Glute Bridge Curl, it possible to perform the Glute Bridge and the Leg Curl separately

Enjoy your training and do not hesitate if you have any questions.

**Suggestions,criticism and feedbacks are welcome**. If you are or were a beginner, did your routine look like that or not at all? Would you like to see any improvements? Any thing that you like or do not like?

Cheers,

Leo

Edit following /u/pranjayv suggestion:

* Front Body Hold = Hollow Body Hold
* Back Body Hold = Reverse Body Hold or Arch Body Hold (however, please form a straight line and do not arch your core)
* Lateral Body Hold = Side Body Hold
* Tuck Open Shoulder Support = Tuck Wall Handstand
* Tuck Closed Shoulder Support = Tuck Reverse Plank  (edit: or Reverse Tabletop) 
* Horizontal Push-Up = Push-Up
* Horizontal Pull-Up = Row/Australian Pull-Up/Bodyweight Row (and many other names...)"
6-Month Anorexia Progress,shenreice,2180,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ifqkpg/6month_anorexia_progress/,1598281123.0,"I started doing the recommended routine about 6 months ago, and at the time couldn't do a pushup or a deadhang. For some reason my core has always been super strong though. I've had abs since I was 6. 😄 Due to a shoulder injury my progress was slower than I would've liked (couldn't dead hang until after 3 months of PT). Worked up to 3x5 Pushups, 3x1 Pullup, 3x8 Inverted Rows, 3x30s Handstand, 3x8 Pistol Squats. (Didn't do dips due to shoulder pain) Idid a Push/Pull split 6 days a week, although I'd have to take days off if my shoulder or back flared up.

I've always struggled a lot with my weight being super low, but I've managed to put on 25 pounds of mostly muscle. This is the most I've ever weighed but I honestly feel so much healthier, and not so embarrassed about my size. I'm still 'underweight' but I'll get there eventually. Started out 5'10 at 100#, now up to 125#. 

I had back surgery this past Tue, so I wanted to document the progress I've made as I know I'm getting ready to lose it all. (3 months of bed rest 😴) But I'm hoping once I recover I'll be able to gain the muscle back more quickly than before. The foundation is there at least. It'll be a long road to recovery but hopefully it'll get rid of my chronic back pain that has been impeding my progress!

## **Here's a proposed wiki edit:**

**https://gist.github.com/sgup/f10f1d57e54b7876495f4bafb6d697eb**

Proposed Changes:

- Adds more clarity in header section (Goals, Schedule, Equipment)
- Expands Strength Sets into a Table (Like Warmup)
- Move down Progression Explanation, and instead link on First Pair (Can be a separate page)
- Links to apps / cheat sheets made more accessible

Let's make this thing darn simple for newbies (like we all were once upon a time).

Sidenote: I think writing a great guide is a very difficult feat. Imagine someone making a hiking map after they've already climbed the mountain, taken a nap, and sitting atop a mountain summit ([Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)). If any beginners who are in the process of learning the RR (aka in the middle of hiking the mountain) could chime in, that would be amazing.

Thank you for all the positive comments! Glad you think this edit is useful.

To the negative ones (mostly mods and other regulars): 

These are simply proposed changes, not meant as an attack on anyone. Nothing is perfect, we should constantly strive to improve in all aspects. In our training, and in the way we pass knowledge to others. The main argument you are making is that these changes are unnessesary or superflous, but it can't hurt to try, and seems helpful to others."
"Rows are an excellent exercise for improving your posture and preparing you for pull ups and muscle ups.

#Video: https://youtu.be/rloXYB8M3vU

My favorite minimalistic way is to simply get a bedsheet, make a knot at the end of it, throw it over the door, close the door shut, hold the sheet and row, row, row your boat! The lower you hold onto it, the harder it will be. By the time you max out this progression, hopefully you will find an alternative (like a pair of rings), but you could also do **one-arm rows** with this setup and it works *very* well! This way, nobody has excuses! "
You don't have to look ripped to be proud of your progress,None,2167,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/l7yn1k/you_dont_have_to_look_ripped_to_be_proud_of_your/,1611941771.0,"I think this deserves saying. If you're making progress, if you're feeling strong, you should be damned proud of yourself.

I am not ripped. Not at all. But, I did my first fully clean archer pull up last night. And, I'm proud as hell of that. Does it show in the mirror? Nope. I still like a bit pudgy. But, I am inching closer to front lever every day, and I can now do a free handstand.

I'm not saying this to brag (but for real, I am proud :D) I'm saying this, because it's easy to see images of people on this sub and compare yourself. I've got nothing against people posting pictures of their progress. They should be damned proud. But, I know it's easy to feel like your progress isn't as important or exciting compared to that kind of really visible progress. 

Your progress IS IMPORTANT and it's AWESOME!

Celebrate what you've done so far and be excited for the future. If that results in a six pack, then hell yeah. If it doesn't, it's still a super awesome journey that will no doubt improve your life."
Many of you guys here wonder how does a purely calisthenics physique look like. Here is my example.,Maecenas23,2123,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9s8ezt/many_of_you_guys_here_wonder_how_does_a_purely/,1540773467.0,"[https://imgur.com/a/B7eijOU](https://imgur.com/a/B7eijOU)This is what my body looks like. I've been training calisthenics for many years, but never followed a strict diet or even exercise plan. I eat whatever I like, sometimes up to 4000 kcal a day. I just do pull ups and dips 2-3 times a week (without additional weight) and do running on the rest of the days. Never touched weights in my life. I suppose that's how most average people will look like following my simple routine.

My regular training session lasts anywhere from 40 minutes to 1 hour, and I think it's a huge bonus if you want to spare your time on going to the gym. I'm also extremely strong in pull ups, probably in 0.0001% of the population strengthwise, just because I've been doing them for so many years. Once I decided to test my sheer pulling strength by doing pull ups with 64 kgs of added weight. I did 6 clean pull ups. Also 12 pull ups with 48kg and 23 with 20 kg. Same goes for dips, I had no problem doing 27 dips with 20 kgs on a belt. Also on one occasion I visited a gym just to test compound lifts. Bench pressed 5 reps with 100 kg, did 2 reps of 140 kg deadlift, and 4 reps with 100 kg squat (although I was surprisingly strong in doing 80 kg squat - cranked 28 reps doing it for the first time, so I guess distance running gives you some strength endurance). OHP was my weakest lift - I did only 1 rep with 55 kgs.  My weight fluctuates from 175 to 180 lbs. I guess if I followed a strict diet plan I would look much better, but it is too bothersome."

Did a pull up for the first time in my life today!!!,slimmaslam,2070,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nyd2y1/did_a_pull_up_for_the_first_time_in_my_life_today/,1623522648.0,"Hi bodyweightfitness, 

I cannot tell you how exciting this is. I started doing the recommended routine (I think an older version because I am using an app for Android) last summer kind of casually since I couldn't go to the gym anymore because of the pandemic. 

When I was a regular at the gym I did weights and could squat and deadlift around 130lbs but my arms were never that strong. For the record I'm 5'5 125-135lbs. I would do the assisted pull up machine but was definitely plateauing at a certain amount of weight. 

Well I got more serious about the bodyweight routine in the fall and in march, I bit the bullet and got a power tower to try to train to do pull ups on. Now here in June, I just did my first one ever! For the record, when I started, I couldn't even lift myself out of a dead hang on the bar. So I added negatives and scapular shrugs(? Not actually sure what they're called but when you just try to start a pull up from a dead hang) to my routine. 

I know there are lots of people out there doing crazy hard stuff but for me 1 pull up was my ultimate goal and I can't believe it happened. 

I even remember in elementary school, my gym teacher making me redo the static arm hang because I dropped after like two seconds and he didn't want to fail me. So it's just unbelievable. 

Last thing, and sorry for the long post, I did up my protein intake too which I think helped. Just an extra 20g from a shake everyday. 

I feel like sarah connor, people, thank you so much!

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for all the nice thoughts and good luck to all the people who are still working on getting their first pull up in! And just for the record, I'm actually a woman and I only bring it up because when I first looked up r/bodyweightfitness I couldn't find any women's journeys to a pull up, so to the other strong women out there, you can definitely do it!"

When I was 24, I decided to get in shape. Not for medical reasons, just wanted to look good. I found this subreddit and started following the program while changing my eating habits. One year later, I was a different man.

I don't know if it was the weight loss or the exercise, but I never had an Asthma attack since I lost all the weight. It was surreal. I didn't even realized that I was no longer using the spray until my mom told me that I should have more of them around the house.

I just wanted to say to all of you: thank you. Your post are inspiring and I wouldn't be were I'm right now if not for you guys."
I got the call to compete on American Ninja Warrior Season 8!,Electron_YS,2065,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4gjjhp/i_got_the_call_to_compete_on_american_ninja/,1461687159.0,"**Reddit, I am super stoked!** I just got the call that I've been waiting on for months. Out of 50,000 ninjas who auditioned from all across America, I was selected to be one of 100 to run in the Oklahoma City regional course! This is my first time ever on such a big show, and I'm excited and nervous.

I've been training for ANW this past year, originally being motivated by /u/PlanchePRO who competed last season. I really wanted a high quality video like his, so I tried to learn how to shoot video and bought all the equipment. The whole thing was a great big learning process, but it was one of the best experiences ever. I got to show off Austin, TX and even worked with a museum of bodybuilding to show some history of what I like to do.

A big part of my training is bodyweightfitness, and I have met many of my training partners on this sub. Shout out to my bro /u/KapperKalisthenics and /u/PlanchePRO who's gonna be making the trip with me!

If you have questions for me about how to apply to the show, my training, etc. let me know!

I hit my first ever set of 5 pullups!,None,2052,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/iximo1/i_hit_my_first_ever_set_of_5_pullups/,1600758568.0,"Im pretty happy right now. Ive been doing Calisthenics seriously for about 1 year now. I couldn't do 3 squats, a single push-up, let alone a pull-up. I started at around 275 lbs. I started off thinking that to get strong I needed to eat hella food. Having a slow metabolism and a sub par bodyweight circuit  I gained 12 lbs in 2 months. It was all fat, I came to this sub reddit and educated myself. I asked my dad and people I knew who worked out religiously for advice, I came up with a good weekly routine and a general sense of diet. In 6 months of trial and error i lost about 20ish pounds. Sitting at around 263lbs I managed my first pull-up 2 months ago. I've trained even harder since then, reaching my lightest weight since middle school at 251lbs. But recently due to improper pull-up form and impatience, I strained my neck muscles. I didnt want to let that keep me down, after 2 days of massaging and rest, I could to my routine with the exception of pull-ups or chin-ups. Today however, coming back in ready to do pull-ups again, I  made sure everything was right: retracted scapula, slight hinge in the elbow, and starting at a dead hang.  I made it a priority to engage the lats and not the neck or traps. Though I tried to go for 6 and ended up half repping the last rep, I still think it was a win. Ive made good progress thus far and I cant wait for whats next. Thank you guys for giving me knowledge and motivation.

Working out at the park jungle gym frowned upon?,None,2039,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/iex06s/working_out_at_the_park_jungle_gym_frowned_upon/,1598156653.0,"I'm a chubby guy who recently decided to get back in shape.

I can't do full pushups from the ground because of a recent radius fracture, so I'm doing pushups off of other surfaces at an incline with a higher number of reps. I push myself til I can barely get in that last rep so I know the workout is working. The local park bench is a great spot for this.

For pull exercises, I'm also too overweight to get in a full pull up, so I have to pull my bodyweight towards the jungle gym in order to strengthen my pull muscles, so I can start doing full pull ups when I shed 20-30lbs.

The thing is, I was doing pushups off the park bench earlier today, and this rather fit gentleman walking his dogs stopped and said something about it like ""Are you seriously working out at a childrens park?"" Like I had done something disgraceful.

I'm not harassing anyone's kids and hardly anyone actually plays at the park during the day. Actually no one was around at the time that I was doing this except for people walking by.

Is it socially acceptable to do body weight exercises using the local park jungle gym? It's all I got. I actually own a door frame pull up bar, but the door frames at my apartment can not handle it.

**EDIT:** Thank you for the support, I had suspected there was no problem with this. I would not work out there if there were actually kids using the jungle gym. He was not the first person to express disapproval that I didn't just have a gym membership, but when you're actually trying to improve yourself there will always be people who challenge your methods."
"At 42, it took a pandemic to get me going...but I’m about 8 weeks in and loving it",S2catzo,2029,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/glmhbo/at_42_it_took_a_pandemic_to_get_me_goingbut_im/,1589746562.0,"*Long post alert* 

So here I was, 42, and the Corona Virus gets real. The last 20ish years have been a bit abysmal in terms of fitness and really taking care of my health. 

After some self reflection I decided I’m going to come out of this thing a better person than I went into it.

Gyms closed, no problem, I’m not really a big fan. Have always been more into sports than pushing weight. Even during the last decades I’ve always been quasi doing something, hockey, golf, baseball, squash, something. Just never consistently since I was around 20.  

So I dusted off the elliptical that had been doubling as a clothing rack since a month after I purchased it a little over 8 years ago.

30 mins a day about 5 days a week on interval training setting. After a couple weeks I had slowly increased the difficulty and was happy I was just doing something.

I got cocky and followed my wife in a 5 exercise downward ladder. Starting at 10 each then 9 and down to 1. Pushups, lunges, crunches, planks and squats. I got down to 5 and I thought I was going to die. Did the pushups on my knees, and there was no going past the 5th set. The next 3 days were torture. But I kept on the elliptical and worked through the seemingly unrelenting soreness. 

The next week I started following a push up program another friend of mine was doing. 7 weeks to 100 pushups by Steve Speirs. 3 times a week, 15 mins a day, 1 min rest between sets. No way I can do this.

The thought of doing 1 pushup at that point was almost as daunting as 100. At about 275lbs I just couldn’t imagine it. 

Day 1 saw me do a total of 7 pushups over 5 sets, and push up 2 on set 5 was like getting to the top of Everest. And from that day on it’s been akin to a bit of an addiction. 

Fast forward 5 weeks and 2 days of failed attempts then repeating those days to completion and I just finished my first 7 set day 6 6 10 10 6 6 20

About 2 weeks in I started adding...now day 1 3 and 5 is pushups, body squats and bicycle crunches. All at the same rep and set counts. 

Day 2 4 and 6 is not off days anymore and I’m into reverse planks, lunges (these have been a real bitch) and bicycle crunches again. Starting at lower numbers on the lunges and doing 5 x 30 second reverse planks. 

Along with this I do a stretching routine after the daily workout, which is a hodgepodge of yoga stretches and some other stuff I’ve found for my lower back. I also can’t help myself and usually push out an extra few sets of 10 pushups every day. 

The elliptical is just not keeping my attention but I’ve been doing a ton of walking. Looking to buy a bike to get the cardio going more. 

The next big step is diet, I haven’t really touched it at all as I was focused on the activity routine first. I’m down around 8 lbs currently. But a lot of weight shifting so the number doesn’t concern me as much. 

Looking forward to following the posts and seeing how far this can take me.

To all of my chubby, old brethren out there, it’s tough, but you can likely do more than you think....just start doing it!!"

Calisthenics Intermediate Hypertrophy Program using Dr. Mike Israetel's Volume Guidelines,pranjayv,1999,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ee3ygd/calisthenics_intermediate_hypertrophy_program/,1577014270.0,"Dr. Mike Israetel is one of the most respected figure in the online fitness community. He is known for his volume landmarks for hypertrophy. You can find all the info related to his volume guidelines [here](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth/) and [here](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/expert-advice/hypertrophy-training-guide-central-hub).

He is not talked about much in bodyweight fitness or calisthenics communities but his guidelines can be used by us to create an effective calisthenics hypertrophy program. In this post, I have tried to create a bodyweight only hypertrophy program following his volume guidelines and by chosing the most effective bodyweight exercises for the particular muscle groups. You can do this program anytime anywhere. You only need a pair of rings.

This also provides the subscribers of this subreddit with options other than the RR. Don't get me wrong here. I am not trying to overcomplicate things or contributing to the problem of paralysis by analysis. I am just providing an option.

This post is inspired from [u/faithlesswonderboy](https://www.reddit.com/user/faithlesswonderboy/)'s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aoxuaa/mike_israetels_hypertrophy_guide_summarized_in/) on r/fitness summarising Mike Israetel's hypertrophy guidlines in one [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dc0oZnkxcFVZ6Cl8whOs2O1AiXNKSkhRCRJmJ103_QA/edit#gid=0).

* The exercise selection has been kept simple because the basics work! I have chosen basic exercises in which you can easily track progress. I have not chosen weighted exercises like deadlifts, weighted dips etc because I wanted to create a calisthenics only program that can be done anytime anywhere. You only need a pair of rings. You can do other exercises like ring pushups, weighted pullups, bench press or whatever.
* The rep ranges are as per Mike Israetel's guidelines. You can change the rep range if you want. Good example is of mantle chinups. Instead of building upto 20 reps per set(which is almost impossible), stick to 6-8 reps per set and increase intensity.
* Start with MAV and then increase total sets to MRV over a period of 4-6 weeks, then take a deload week and start another cycle if you want. Ultimately, you should try to move on to a harder progression of the exercise. The main way to progress is by adding sets but if you can progress to a harder variation of the exercise in the given rep range, fell free to do so.
* The sets should not be taken to failure especially with heavier exercises. Leave 1-2 reps in the tank (RPE 8). This way you can accumulate a lot more volume than if you took your sets to failure. Leaving more than 1-2 reps in the tank won't help ypu much because for hypertrophy, not only total volume, but also the number of sets taken close to failure is also important. RPE 8 is a sweet spot between volume and sets being close to failure. Try to stick to that. You can take the last set to failure if you want. Or for lighter exercises like tricep extensions and calf raises, you can take all sets to failure.
* Since we are using bodyweight exercises for legs, feel free to use a higher rep range (even 30+ or 40+ reps per set). You can also experiment by going beyond your MRV. It is highly unlikely that you will ever outgrow the shrimp squat and bodyweight hamstring curl. The real problem is with BSS. For BSS, you can use a very high rep range or add isometric pauses at various points of the ROM to make them harder.

# Possible Questions

* **Where is the work for forearms?**

Pullups, rows and curls will hit your forearms quite hard. But if you want to do extra forearm work, a good way to do that is to hang for as long as you can after the last rep of the last set of your pullups. This won't require any extra time investment and you would be able to accumulate a lot of volume.

&#x200B;

* **Where is the work for the lower back?**

Hamstring curls will work your lower back. But if you want some extra work, you can do reverse plank or reverse hyperextensions. A good way to do that is between rest breaks of upper body exercises. You can do a set of reverse hyperextensions in between the rest breaks of your dips or chinups.

&#x200B;

* **What about skill work, cardio and conditioning?**

You can do that on your off days. Just make sure you are able to recover well in between sessions. Since this is a hypertrophy program, your main focus should be to increase volume. In the later stages of the program where the volume would become very high, it might become hard for you to recover if you add skill work or conditioning work.

&#x200B;

* **How much rest between sets?**

Rest 3-5 minutes between sets of harder compound exercises which are being done for lower reps, 2-3 minutes for easier compound exercises which are being done for higher reps and 1-2 minutes for isolation exercises.

&#x200B;

* **Is this the best program ever created?**

As the name indicates, these volume guidelines are just guidelines that work for majority of the people. The exact values for MV, MEV, MAV and MRV are almost impossible to find and the figures can vary from person to person. These guidelines are just another way to look at things. This is not the only way to work out.

&#x200B;

EDIT : As u/rogor_ mentioned, there were some mistakes in the example upper lower routine. Corrections have been made."

###Your goal is a Freestanding Handstand. Here are the ways to get there...

------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Warm Up** 

 * Warm-Up however way you wish but we urge you to always do this [Wrist Mobility Warm Up.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE) that's part of our [Recommended Routine warm-up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_warm-up.3A_dynamic_stretches_.285-10min.29)

* **Progressions**

 * **Chest to Wall Handstand:** If you can hold a regular [Plank for 60secs,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ScXWFaVBs) start going into a [Wall Plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jm4R3K4sJA) and move toward the [Chest to Wall HS](https://i.imgur.com/PXTMOSe.png) eventually with your wrists close to the wall. To exit, walk your hands out or do the [""Pirouette Bail.""](https://youtu.be/fOy7sE1_vI0?t=2m59s) (Don't hold to absolute failure so you have energy to exit safely.)

 * **Back to Wall Handstand:** After you are comfortable in the Chest to Wall Handstand, practice getting comfortable in a Back to Wall HS. To do so, you need to learn how to [How to Kick Up Into HS.](https://youtu.be/qFHihLdj_xk?t=315)

* **Rebalancing Drills** 

 * After you are comfortable in back & chest-to-wall handstands, practice these:

 * [Heel Pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYehg2ruMN0)

 * [Toe Pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-7QXCsPL0)

 * Any Other Calibrations

* **Supplemental Work for the Core**

 * [Hollow Hold](http://youtu.be/44ScXWFaVBs?t=5m18s) will help you build core strength and full body tension in the shape you need to replicate while upside down. ([Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2cqg35/starting_handstands/cji88km))


---------------------
###If you already have a Freestanding HS, you have a ton of things to work on:

---------------

* Increase hold time
* Straighter bodyline: Open shoulders / reduce arch in lower back.([Emmets post is very thorough](https://emmetlouis.wordpress.com/2014/10/04/fixing-arched-back-in-handstand/))
* Handstand walking (forward and backwards)
* Head Tucked In Freestanding Handstand (Look at your Feet)
* Different Shapes/Leg Positions (e.g., Tuck HS, Straddle)
 * [Straight, Tuck, Straddle combination.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWEHO7rPa-0) 
 * [More leg combinations.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B50c3TinDCQ&t=24s)
* Different entries/exits
 * Tuck up, straddle up, pike up
 * Straddle Press, Puppy Press, Pike Press, Stalder Press
* Advanced Shapes ([One Arm HS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytjIgIe5CVQ), Figa, [Scorpion,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXppo4oE9L0) [Mexican HS,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW1Ej-YeuhU etc)
* Handstand Push Ups (Wall or Freestanding)

## Can I join even if I've never done *any* Handstand stuff before? 

Yes! Read the progressions above which basically tell you to: follow/memorize the wrist warm up video, master the hollow hold so your abs get strong, and practice the wall plank. As you gain comfort there, move your hands closer to the wall for a nice chest-to-wall handstand.

##But I'm too scared...

That's why we have you starting with the wall plank.

##But my wrists hurt...

* Then maybe the focus for your entire month should be on the wrist mobility so your wrists get stronger and hollow hold so your core is strong. Do NOT neglect the wrist warm up. Your wrists are the weakest link. They are not built like ankles, yet your entire bodyweight is going on them, so please, respect them! 

* **If you truly need a massive regression,** you can also [master the crow pose/frog stand,](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5lgudw/welcome_to_the_crow_pose_motivational_month_the/) as it might not be as hard on the wrists and is considered the baby foundation of all hand-balancing.

I had a powerful insight about the importance of working out,northmuscle_,1962,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nf47g5/i_had_a_powerful_insight_about_the_importance_of/,1621322750.0,"Usually when talking about working out and basically any form of physical excersise people really focus on the results. The reason for someone doing something is the end result, everyone has goals and the purpose of working out is almost always achieving those goals. But I noticed that means that you don't work out because you necessarily like doing it, you work out because lets say you want to achieve a certain physique.

Thats why a lot of people lack the motivation to continue practising this hobby or simply don't start at all. Thats really different from other types of hobbies where the activity itself is pleasurable enough that you don't care much about goals. 

I always though that I too focus solely on the results - getting stronger, achieving a certain move. But I just realised thats far from it.

Recently in my life a series of events made me seriously doubt my self worth. And soon after I got ill and couldn't work out or even *eat properly* for a few weeks. I lost a couple of kg of muscle mass and I felt terrible.

 But then when I got well I was able to work out again. And boy did that magically fix my mental health issues instantly. I didn't care about results. I didn't care I lost quite some strenght and now was pretty far from my goals. All that mattered was that working out was cool and people who do it are cool and if Im doing it too then that means Im cool too, even if just a little bit.

I realised that all this time my workout sessions were not only strenghtening my body but shielding me from all my insecurities and preserving my self worth."

Above are the results of the tread made here! (https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/75srwv/if_you_could_only_do_five_exercises_to_get_in_the/). I stoped reading comments yesterday at 8 pm, but I don't think any was left out. I made 2 tables, the first one with the sheer data and the 2nd one organized by categories. Please realize there was just one person doing this compilation, so of course my bias is somewhere (Like putting in the same category ""Clean & Press and Clean & Jerk"") but I hope overall it is helpful to you and faithful to what you wrote (I didn't picked the information or anything). Some of my thoughts:

-First of all, thanks to everyone for the great participation! It was much more than what I expected, I hope you enjoyed it and that this helps you greatly. Reading books and the ""serious research"" sometimes makes you forget or not appreciate how everyone has figured something out for themselves, and there is a lot to learn from each of those choices.

-Pull ups/Chin ups and Squats reign supreme! The back and the legs are really where the power is. Don't forget that.

-I hope you get to see that, even if sometimes training seems confusing, most of us are doing the same stuff. We all recognize pretty much the same movements as the key for strength, looks, performance, happiness, etc. Don't get lost in the details and keep your north in mind!

-I also hope you stay truth to the exercises you chose (in the past or with this new info). Something in you told you those exercises are the key to most of your physical goals (I left the ""best shape of your life"" to each's interpretation) and you should trust that! Whatever you do, my advice is to stay loyal to your intuition and prioritize your chosen exercises over all the ""information noise"" out there.

I'm eager to listen to your thoughts, so make sure to share them here :) "

A Compilation Of Free Calisthenics Workout Programs,rickdonohoe,1935,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ik3t17/a_compilation_of_free_calisthenics_workout/,1598899209.0,"After reviewing a bunch of paid calisthenics programs back in December 2019 ([see this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/e6dlgo/a_review_of_7_different_calisthenics_programs_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) , I thought I'd research what **free** workout programs there are available online, and compile a list of what I could find including:

* What is it
* Where can I get it
* Would I recommend it?

I've compiled [a list of 9 free programs here](https://www.calisthenics-101.co.uk/free-calisthenics-workout-programs) but I'd be keen to add to that list if anybody can recommend some other online calisthenics workout plans which are free? (Yes, it includes the RR!).

I have to admit I was surprised at how little there was available when looking on Google. So many things are listed as 'plans' but are barely more than a single workout!

I also remember there been quite a few paid plans that were temporarily given away for free earlier this year when most countries were in a lockdown, but looking back through the sub it would appear that is no more.

Has anybody found any success elsewhere that they'd recommend I add to the list?"
My Handstand Journey: What I wish I knew when I began,Deanosaurus88,1934,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g7rvrq/my_handstand_journey_what_i_wish_i_knew_when_i/,1587813326.0,"Hi all, thought I'd share this to help anyone who is struggling or just starting out with their handstands.

My HS journey began a good year and a half ago. It has taken me that long to competently and consistently hold 10+ second HSs (which was my original goal). I had a solid strength base (weightlifting background) and semi-decent shoulder flexibility, but mastering the balance was my biggest challenge. My HS is still far from perfect, but the entire philosophy in this community - which is something I absolutely love - is the desire to constantly improve, without all the macho bravado of some other fitness cultures out there.

Here are some (purely anecdotal) **Handstand tips and tricks that I wish I knew when I first began**:


**LOGISTICS**

* **Be in it for the long-haul**: HS training is not a short-term ""learn in 30 days"" type skill, despite what some YouTubers would have you believe. For the majority of people, without coaching, going from zero-to-HS-hero *will take a long time*. Don't fret though, the journey is what makes it worth it. Greatness can only come from overcoming difficulty.
* **Train as often as you can**: Frequency is key, rather than volume. In other words, 5 minutes every day is better than three 45 minute sessions per week. HSs are a mechanical skill, and therefore require procedural muscle memory (for balance). Procedural muscle memory is the same muscle memory you acquire when learning to ride a bike, or drive a manual car, or brush your teeth. You can't *push* your way through it, you just need to rinse and repeat until it becomes second nature.
* **Optimal training time**: With the above being said, volume is still of course important. For optimal volume, I personally found that 15 minutes daily practice worked best to build that procedural muscle memory, with days off here and there to rest my wrists. For me, those 15 minutes did not include the warm-up, but began with (1) back-2-wall practice, (2) chest-2-wall practice and (3) freestanding practice
* **Get help**: Coaching is expensive, and there are now hundreds if not thousands of callisthenics/handbalancing coaches out there. I admit, I have never used one, BUT I was lucky enough to find someone in my local area who was a strong handstander. He was incredibly kind and met with me to coach me and would review my form from videos I sent him. I can't stress this enough: *This was a big turning point in my HS development*. If you don't have the same luck, use the community: post videos in r/handbalancing, r/Handstands, r/bodyweightfitness, r/overcominggravity, etc and get some feedback. It really does help.
* **Record yourself**: Take videos of your form. Review it and make adjustments. This constant back-and-forth will slowly but surely improve your practice.
* **Improvement is not linear**: Distinct from other fitness disciplines, HS progression is not linear. You may be stuck for months, then one day and for no apparent reason suddenly find your center of balance, only to lose it again the following week. Don't get frustrated, just enjoy the ride. If it's not working for you, brush it off and try again tomorrow. So long as you show up to train, *you will improve eventually*.
* **Skill before strength work**: As most of you probably know from the RR / OG book, do your HS work early in your workout, before strength work, but after your warm-up/mobility.


**MECHANICS**

* **Never underestimate the importance of the wall**: IMO all freestanding HS practice should begin with wall practice, both chest-2-wall and back-2-wall.
* **Always warm-up your wrists**: If your wrists get injured, your training gets limited beyond recognition. No more HSs, no more levers, no more pullups, pressups, L-sits, etc etc. Don't risk it. Warm-up those wrists before *every* session. I highly recommend [GMB’s wrist warmup](https://youtu.be/mSZWSQSSEjE) as a warmup, along side [Antranik’s wrist strengthening exercises ](https://youtu.be/T58Gmo77Iow), which I personally do every morning *and* as part of my warmup routine.
* **Always Listen to your body**: If your wrists (or any other body part) begin to hurt frequently, take some time off. One or two weeks off is *far* better than 6 months if you get injured. Heck, in my personal opinion, if you're just not in the right head space that day, don't beat yourself up for not *battling through*. That mentality is collateral damage from other, more bravado-inspired, fitness cultures. Are you a professional athlete? Does your livelihood depend on you pushing through a workout your body doesn't want? No? Then take a day off.
* **Kick up slowly, with straight legs**: The aim of the game is *control*. Aim to get your hips above your shoulders with each kick-up. Better to undershoot, and keep practising the kick-up than to continuously overshoot.
* **Kick up with your strongest side**: Don't dilute your training efforts by trying to master each side. Like I mentioned above, you need to develop the procedural muscle memory (neural pathways) necessary to balance yourself upside down. Focusing only on one side may be counterproductive in other disciplines, but with HSs you will want to master the balance first. Then you can balance out the skill by kicking up in different ways (weaker leg first, straddle HS, etc)
* **Find your favourite starting position and stick with it**: In the early days I practised kicking up from standing, from kneeling, with one leg and then the other. In short, it was too *diluted* (as mentioned above). Choose one, and stick with it until you master the muscle memory needed to balance. I personally preferred kicking up from a kneeling position (not dissimilar to a sprinter's starting line position).
* **It's in the palms of your hands**: Quite literally, you will be holding balance with your palms, or more specifically, tiny intricate muscle movements going back and forth between your fingers (when you lean too far forward) and the 'heel' of your palm (when leaning too far backwards). Focus on this, practice it in frogstand to help acquire the muscle memory, concentrate on it every time you are upside down. The muscular adjustments you will make will be too much at first, since the neural connections are weak, but over time they will become more precise, just like how the fluidity of brushing your teeth with your weaker hand would improve if you used it every time.
* **Hands shoulder width apart, elbows locked**: This is perhaps an obvious one, but despite being aware of it I never focused enough on it until I got some advice and started recording myself. My hands were too wide apart and elbows would (and admittedly still sometimes do) bend a little. Keep working on it.
* **Hands and feet not too far apart:** Picture a downward dog starting position as a HS starting point. If your legs are too far away from your hands, it is more difficult to find your center of gravity when you kick up. Bring your legs closer to your hands.


**PHILOSOPHY**

* **It's the journey that counts**: Your HS journey will be long and challenging, yet at the same time immensely fun and interesting. Everyone's journey will be a little different. There is no finish line, really; for every goal you achieve there is something else to learn. This doesn't mean there is no point in trying though, instead, it is the continuous process of *attentive learning* that provides the purpose. In 10 years from now, you can look back and witness incredible personal progress, determination and commitment, or you can witness procrastination, laziness and regret. You choose your journey.
* **All you have to do is turn up**: The human desire to *do nothing*, put things off, and essentially save energy is dangerously powerful. But is manageable. If you find yourself the type of person who only sticks to things for a few weeks before giving up, remember this: *all you have to do is turn up*. You don't actually *have* to exercise today, for now, just put on your exercise clothes. You don't actually *have* to do a long session today, for now, just do 5 minutes. You don't actually *have* to break any records today, for now, just finish the session. One brick at a time builds a city.
* **Share the wealth**: I wonder how much money combined this community saves by *not* paying for gym memberships? I wonder how many of us shed those extra 10kgs, got our first chin-up, got that six-pack, or mastered the HS *without* expensive gym memberships? A healthy, fit and strong lifestyle is there for the taking, but most people don't know. Share the wealth! Spread the word and get more people into this lifestyle.


I hope that helps some of you! Best of luck.

For the first time I didn't care that people were watching me workout,hobo2166,1902,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nb6r7h/for_the_first_time_i_didnt_care_that_people_were/,1620874462.0,"I have always worked out either in my room or basement and never outside. I am an introverted person and caring about other peoples opinions has affected my relationship with others and my confidence. 

However, for the first time in my life, I trained with gymnastic rings on a path way that people walk on and completed a workout.

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I'm perfect but proud of myself for not just the physical aspect of working out but the mental. I even talked myself out of not working out outside because I was worried that I would look stupid but had no choice but to do it outside as everyone in my house was sleeping. 

To anyone who is worried about the awkward gazes people give you or the mom telling her kid to come to her when you're doing pull ups at the park, try using headphones and music those really helped me a lot and at the end of the day no one will remember the guy working out. 

I promise no one really cares unless they're genuinely interested in calisthenics too. And people are probably just curious too as to what you're doing especially using rings on a tree.

Realized how much stronger I've gotten after 6ish months of the recommended routine.,UnhappyAmoeba,1906,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kjr5wt/realized_how_much_stronger_ive_gotten_after_6ish/,1608861766.0,"I've always been an overweight, completely out of shape guy. Started doing the recommended routine in the beginning half of the year. While I've seen my progress growth (went from struggling on dead hangs to being able to do 3 sets of six pulls up), I guess i never realized it outside of my workout routine. 

Yesterday I went to an obstacle course with my girlfriend and there was a section that was a slackline with hanging logs blocking the path with ropes dangling in front of the. for you to climb over the logs with. I was standing there thinking it was impossible for me to do something like that and almost turned around. My girl was encouraging me and when I tried it was so easy it shocked me. It was the weirdest sensation realizing I could do something like that. My mind is still so use to my clumsy, out of shape body that things still feel impossible for me, but when i actually tried it was so easy. 

Just wanted to share. This was really motivating and it pushes me to stick with body weight fitness."
Finally achieved my first pull up - the feeling is unbelieveable,CookingSirloin,1892,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i775j2/finally_achieved_my_first_pull_up_the_feeling_is/,1597073990.0,"Hey r/bodyweightfitness, I started following this sub since the beginning of this year as I was trying to find a way to stay fit during these uncertain times. I initially started off with no equipment so the only exercise I did was the pushup. As a kid, the most amount I ever done in a single session was 40, so naturally, I wanted to first be able to do 40 strict military style pushups in a row. I eventually achieved this and I was more than satisfied with my progression. My personal best now is 50 pushups in one minute which I worked up to by always practicing pushups (and its variations) explosively.

However, I realized that the feeling of 'finally achieving one rep' in the world of calisthenics is like crack; as once I experienced this euphoria, I knew I needed to delve further. The next goal was the one handed pushup. Which I progressed to using a combination of assisted one arm pushups, archer pushups and pseudo planche pushups. After a month of practicing these moves, I finally was able to push myself up from the bottom position with one arm - albeit with questionable form. The excitement that I enjoyed in that moment is something that I will never forget. In the weeks following my first rep, I worked my way up to 5-6 reps with both arms.

Which brings me to the pullup.

I have never been able to do a single pullup in my life. The hardest part for me was pulling out from the dead hang position. If I started in a slightly bent arm, active hang, I could pull myself up and lower my self in a controlled manner. To increase my strength, I used the resistance band progression method, and negatives - which I routinely did (3 times a week) for about 2 months. Last week, I tried to do a real pullup thinking I had the strength - nope. I still could not pull out of the dead hang. I felt like I had a nail in my shoulder when I tried pulling up. At that point, I almost gave up as I read others were able to achieve the pullup in a much shorter time. I simply felt that maybe the pullup wasnt designed for me as I was able to achieve other exercises in a shorter time.

Today, I finally did it, I pulled out of the dead hang into the active hang, pulled myself over the bar and lowered myself back into the dead hang. I honestly didnt believe what I just did, so I did it again - which I confirmed that it was using strict proper form. Once again, that familiar feeling of excitement, and energy flooded over me. Just last week, I thought I was never going to be able to get it.

I know two pullups isn't much for most people on this subreddit, but I literally feel so happy right now because this was an obstacle that I just could **not** overcome in the past and finally overcoming it is a dream come true. If there is one thing I learned from these experiences, its to never doubt yourself if you are doing the right things at the right times - because you will undoubtedly get it some time down the road."

Hey folks! Nick-E here. Welcome

Many of you will be coming to exercise for the absolute first time ever. Some of you will be coming from time off and want to really ease your way back in, and yet still some others will be wanting to simply reinforce their foundations and knowledge by reading up on the daily readings!

In any case, thanks for coming!

The way the community workouts will be structured is that for the next 14 days, every day you can come onto the subreddit and there will be a workout for you and some informational reading. The reading will be split evenly between:

**Reading about how to properly perform an exercise**

and

**Reading about how training works**

In any other training program you would have to read all of the information spread across these 14 days in one go, or already know it, in order to start a strength training program and also know what you are doing. This 14 day spread should make it much more achievable to get the info in!

By the end of the 14 days, you will have eased your way straight in to the full BWF Primer Routine!

# Reading #1: Understanding Training Nomenclature:

**Reps:**

A 'rep' is short for 'repetition' and refers to a single execution of a movement. If you were to sit in a chair and extend your knee straight out in front of you and then return it to the start position, that is '1 rep' of a knee extension. If you did that 10 times in a row, thats '10 reps' of a knee extension.

**Sets:**

A set is a specified number of reps to perform of an exercise. If you do 10 knee extensions, then wait a bit, 10 more knee extensions, then wait a bit, and 10 more, you've just done 3 sets of 10 knee extensions. In most training programs, you will see this shortened to '3x10 knee extensions'. You can read the 'X' as 'sets of'.

3x10 = 3 sets of 10.

**Rest:**

This one is self explanatory, it is just the period of time between sets of an exercise where you rest. But more specifically, it refers to the amount of time that the parts of the body that are involved in an exercise are resting (not doing anything). You do not necessarily need to be completely immobilised during your rest periods (we can go into more detail on the implications of this on a later date.)

**Adding in Rep-ranges:**

You will see in this program and others, thigns looking like this:

3x5-8

This means '3 sets of 5 to 8 reps' and usually refers to a set progression scheme, where you will try to increase your reps performed by 1 rep every session within that range until you reach the top range, at which point you will move on to a harder exercise.

For example:

If you had a program that said 3x5-10 Squats. You would do your first workout doing 3x5 squats, and then next workout, try to do 3x6. If you succeeded, then next time do 3x7. If you succeeded, then next time do 3x8, etc. etc. etc. repeating until you can do 3x10 squats. Then you would move on to a harder exercise that works the same muscles, and start back at 3x5, repeating that process for the new harder exercise. This is the basis of how most simple strength training programs will work in bodyweight fitness given the lack of external weights to add on to make movements harder in a simpler way.

# Reading #2: How to do Push-ups (At any strength level).

The following is a guide I've made on how to do push-ups, which will be the very first exercise you learn in this program.

It's bit long, but if you set aside about (15-20 minutes?) you should be able to read through the whole thing, try it out a couple times, and feel relatively confident about how they work. The exercise in the section '**How to Build Up To a Push-up if You Can't Yet Do One'** will be the focal point of the guide for the purposes of this workout, but it is worth reading and trying to comprehend the whole thing.

# [Nick-E's Push-up Guide](https://www.nick-e.com/push-up/)

Many if not all of the exercises in this routine (and in general) will appear simple to do, but will be deceptively complex to do **well**, so if you don't grasp 100% of the nuance in the guide in the first go-around, don't worry. You're not really expected to, we just want you to have access to it to check back and learn more over time.

Once you've finished that, head on down to the next section!

# Workout #1:

This workout is actually very quick and straightforward. It will likely not feel like a 'workout' in the sense that it tires you or makes you feel especially sore. Consider it more as a self-directed learning exercise. The workouts will become harder throughout the days, do not worry!

For today: **You will simply perform 5 sets of 5 reps of push-ups at whatever incline is appropriate for you, with 60 seconds of rest between sets (or however long it takes you to review your footage).** This would be written as:

5x5 (Incline) Push-ups, 60s rest.

*For reference, the '****appropriate intensity****' of these push-ups should be very* ***moderate***\*. The focus of this 14 day build-up to the full primer routine is technical competence, rather than pushing yourself. You should start by picking an intensity that you could easily do several more reps of if you wanted to.\* ***It should not feel trivially easy, but if you are struggling to manage 5 reps, or struggling to finish all sets, you've started out way too hard***\*. You will be exercising 6x per week in this period, and you don't want to be maiming yourself with intensity. Leave that for the full primer after the 2 weeks!\*

It is highly recommended that you film yourself from the side and front in your sets, so you can watch this footage back in your rests to evaluate your form and compare them to the videos in the above guide, so you can learn how to identify errors in your own form and improve independently!

# Ok, I did it!

Congratulations!

DAILY HABITS THAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW TO IMPROVE YOUR POSTURE,Vforged_,1879,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jp2g5v/daily_habits_that_you_should_follow_to_improve/,1604656452.0," 

Our daily habits have a huge impact on how our posture will look. So by adopting good daily practices, you can easily improve your posture to a great extent. We have mentioned below the top 10 daily habits that you can follow to improve your posture.

### 1. STRAIGHTEN UP

Straightening up your body every time possible is the best thing you can do to improve your posture. Always imagine a string is attached to your head, and some force is pulling you upwards, making you straight and tall.

 Straight posture will help in generating the least strain on your body while performing physical activities like sitting, standing, walking, etc, and provide you a good posture. However, you should avoid slouching every time possible as it adds stress to the spine, resulting in the wear of bones, muscles, and joints during any physical activity.

Also, it sometimes makes it harder for lungs and intestines to work, as our internal organs collapse during slouching. Further, it will eventually make it hard to digest food and inhale enough oxygen.

### 2. NEVER SIT FOR LONG HOURS

Sitting for long hours can be very hazardous that you may not have imagined. According to researches, sitting for long hours results in obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist, and many other problems along with cardiovascular activities. So you should always consider breaks after every 30 min, and stretch your body to release all the stresses from the body.

### 3. USE PHONES EFFICIENTLY

Slouching your neck while using the phone strains the spine and neck muscles. Continuous practice of which can result in forwarding head posture. According to researches, for every 1 inch, forward head tilt, an additional 10 pounds load on the cervical spine is exerted. 

This can further lead to pain that stems from joints, discs, nerve roots, and other nearby structures.  
So, the best thing you can do while using a phone is to keep your head in the standard position. Either move your eyes or just lift the phone parallel to your eyes, such that the load on the spine decreases.

### 4. MAKE STRETCHING YOUR COMPANION

Stretching is very useful to improve your body posture. Regular stretching results in strengthening your muscles, which results in making your body align with a good posture. It also helps in increasing your flexibility, further increasing range of motion. So, it is always preferable to stretch your body continuously during the way after some intervals to reduce tension from your muscles.

### 5. SAVE HEELS FOR RIGHT OCCASION

Wearing heels can result in misaligning the balance of your body, as most of the weight concentrate towards the ball of the feet. This concentration of weight on the balls of feet results in 

* Making your lower back move forward, resulting in the misalignment of hips and spine.
* Excessive pressure on the knees.
* Bulging out of the chest in the forward direction.
* Increasing pressure on the balls of the feet.

Therefore, we’ll suggest limiting the use of heels as it can be the main factor contributing to your bad posture.

### 6. EXERCISE REGULARLY

Regular exercise has numerous amount of advantages for your overall health. In case of maintaining a good posture, the main thing you require is body stability exercise provides you with that stability. It strengthens your core, which includes the abdominal and lower back, which are the main muscles stabilizing your whole body. So, if you want to get good posture, the first thing you should do is to work on your core. Good posture while performing any exercise is the first thing you should work on.

### 7. DON'T SLOUCH NECK WHILE EATING

Almost every person has a habit of bending their neck to reach the food, instead of making their hand reach the mouth. You may not realize this, but you are straining your neck while doing this movement, which sometimes results in difficulty in swallowing food. It also results in making your face asymmetrical. So, you should always try to keep your neck straight and make your hands do the work.

### 8. DON'T RECLINE YOUR CAR SEATS

Maintaining a good posture while driving a car will also help reduce lots of strain from your body. Some car seats do not accompany the natural curve of our body, and we make it even worse by reclining it. Bad driving posture can lead to discomfort in the neck, spine, hips, shoulders, feet, and arms, which eventually become vulnerable with time if not corrected. We have mentioned below all the rules that you need to look at while driving a car.

### 9. KEEP SHOULDERS DOWN AND BACK

The shoulder is one of the major muscles in determining the overall physique of a person. However, continuous sitting and slouching results in bending of the shoulder internally, causing rounded shoulders, which is not the comfortable position of the shoulder. So, you should try to externally rotate your shoulder whenever possible and let your shoulder free under the action of gravity. 

### 10. KEEP CHIN TUCKED IN AND PARALLEL TO THE GROUND

Tucking your chin in and keeping it parallel to the ground every day can help your neck by saving it from all the strains. While performing any activity, always try to tuck your chin in and keep it parallel to the ground, and let your body move accordingly. When you tuck your chin, you will experience an automatic back movement of the shoulder, which is good for the posture.

### 11. STICK YOUR TONGUE TO THE ROOF

Most people don’t notice it, but correct tongue posture has a great impact on your posture, especially Face Posture. People who rest their tongue at the bottom may see changes in their facial appearance gradually. Their face will become flatter and longer, and their chin and forehead will start coming forward. Moreover, it will increase the aging process on your face making you look dull and old.

So it is always advised to stick your tongue to the roof of your mouth with your teeth slightly open. The best thing you can do to correct your tongue posture is to perform a very easy practice. 

The first step you need to do is to bring your tongue to the back of your middle tooth and slide your tongue back. As you slide, you will feel a place where the roof of your mouth moves upwards. The spot right before that is where the front tip of your tongue should rest. After you find your tip resting position, start sticking the rest of your tongue to the roof."
"Pro tip: If trying a wall supported handstand against a door, lock the door first",Thrusthamster,1877,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8rqo3k/pro_tip_if_trying_a_wall_supported_handstand/,1529237947.0,"The landing gets pretty gnarly if you accidentally open it with your foot, is what I'm saying"
"Getting told by a parent that I had ""no right to be at the park""",SenseiOfSenseis,1871,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9cszje/getting_told_by_a_parent_that_i_had_no_right_to/,1536041424.0,"So I've started doing park workouts for a couple weeks now. I bring my gymnastics rings and set them up at the side of the swings so I'm on the very corner of the playground not being in the way of any kids that might be there. Today I finished my first set of dips and some kids are playing on my rings. I don't want them to get hurt on my rings and have it be my fault, so I say ""Hey guys, sorry, but those are mine"". I'm going in for my next set when an angry lady, who I presume to be their mother, tells me that they have a right to play with the rings since I'm hanging it on public property. Baffled, me and my friends argue with her for a couple of minutes, and then she changed her stance to ""you shouldn't be working out at a kids park since the park was built for kids"". After a while, she said that she would call the cops, and I told her that if she did, I would respect whatever outcome came out of it. I didn't hear what the cop said verbatim, but it was obvious by the lady's demeanor and responses that he said I was perfectly within my rights to workout at the park, and that I not allow kids to use my equipment, for whatever reason. She wasn't satisfied, so she argued with the guy on the phone, hung up, then called public security. Exhausted, my friend convinces me its not worth it, so I go and set it up on the door frame of a door on the neighboring baseball field.

Just wondering, has anyone ever run into someone like this?

tl;dr
Lady was very angry that I was working out at the park"
Doing Pull-ups during the pandemic increased my height by over 1 inch at 23.,None,1855,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nohw0w/doing_pullups_during_the_pandemic_increased_my/,1622401134.0,"Hi everyone during the pandemic I was recovering from a virus and had suffered lower back problems.  The doctor recommended I start hanging so the cartilage would go into place as I avoided steroids and surgery. Before the injury, I was 5ft10 inches.

As I started hanging and doing pull-ups it hurt initially like a bleeding sensation in my spine L5-L6. But with the consistency of hanging for 5 mins every day and doing 30+ pull-ups throughout the day. 1 year later my parents and friends started saying that I had grown taller. I did not believe them. But today I measured myself and it was 5ft 11 at the end of the day and 5ft 11 ^(1/2)  Inches on my morning height.

I don't if it was the injury that reactivated the growth spurt of my spine, but if it is possible if my spine injury is the reason behind the height gain?

Edit 1: Oh dear this blew up. Thank you, for the awards kind people of the internet. Hopefully, my journey helped other people who are suffering from back problems too."
"The Reverse Plank is one of the most underestimated bodyweight strength exercises: everything you need to know about the RP, including its great benefits",Leo-HolisticStrength,1852,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a6rv0z/the_reverse_plank_is_one_of_the_most/,1544987652.0,"# What is the Reverse Plank

The Reverse Plank is a bodyweight strength exercise which consists in extending your shoulders to a 90° angle while depressing/retracting the scapula with your belly facing upward, with straight joints forming a line and with the feet touching the ground. Here is a picture of me performing the exercise: [https://i.ibb.co/BT8xVvH/33298579-10213434788998006-7255174909498753024-n.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/BT8xVvH/33298579-10213434788998006-7255174909498753024-n.jpg)

There are several progressions for the Reverse Plank. While the Reverse Plank is clearly a beginner level exercise, a Reverse Plank with elevated feet and supinated forearms is much harder and is an intermediate level exercise.

# My observations

* **This exercise is underestimated**: I have been familiar with bodyweight strength training since 2012 and I found that almost nobody is doing this exercise. I have been training in one gym since June 2018 and I never saw anybody doing this exercise in more than 6 months!
* **Few people can perform it correctly:** most people who try this exercise are absolutely incapable of performing it with good form. Almost none of my friends that I met during my calisthenics experience were even able to reach that 90° shoulder extension angle position
* **People put all the blame on a lack of shoulder flexibility**: you definitely need some flexibility to perform this exercise but you also need shoulder and scapular **strength** with straight arms

# The benefits of the RP

I am not going to make a disorganized list of 48 reasons why this is a great exercise. Here are the key reasons based on some critical issues and stakes in the context of the world we live in and bodyweight strength training:

* **Improves posture by working almost all the posterior chain**: contrary to what some dishonest physiotherapists say (they are trying to protect their business),  some strength exercises can help to correct your posture. If you are sitting in a chair for several hours a day, the RP will contribute to correct:
   * **Rounded shoulders**: it strengthens the shoulder extensors at a 90° angle (posterior delts, sternal head of the pecs, triceps) and the scapular retractors (lower/mid traps, rhomboids) & depressors (pec minor, lats) while stretching the shoulder flexors (anterior/lateral delt, clavicular head of the pecs, biceps), which is exactly what you need to fix rounded shoulders
   * **Anterior pelvic tilt**: it strengthens the lower back, the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings while stretching the hip flexors, which is part of what you need to fix APT
* **Improves shoulder extension strength at end range of motion:** ever heard of the German Hang for shoulder extension work? This is indeed a great exercise but as gravity is causing the shoulder extension, the muscles strengthened are the shoulder flexors (which must resist the extension caused by gravity) and not the shoulder extensors. What I mean here is that the German Hang is NOT enough for shoulder extension work. Working on shoulder extension AGAINST gravity is also necessary and this is what will allow to strengthen the shoulder extensors, like in a Front Lever for instance. The RP allows you to strengthen your shoulder extensors at a 90° angle with full scapular depression and retraction, **which is a very common weakness in the general population AND for trained people**. Use it or lose it!
* **Prevents shoulder injuries**: we live in an ""anterior chain dominant"" world. By working the posterior chain, the RP will contribute (I am not saying that the RP is enough) to ensure structural shoulder balance, which will allow to prevent some common shoulder injuries
* **Lack of Reverse Plank work is the reason why the Manna is so rare**  **^(()**[**^(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yowJFre0LgM/hqdefault.jpg)**](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yowJFre0LgM/hqdefault.jpg)**)**: one massive misconception in our community is that the road towards the Manna begins with the L-Sit and the V-Sit. This is absolutely wrong. The road towards the Manna begins with the Reverse Plank. It would take too long to explain (again) in this post so please refer to this post for further explanation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9nlcn7/when\_are\_lsits\_and\_handstands\_not\_considered/e7nn0xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9nlcn7/when_are_lsits_and_handstands_not_considered/e7nn0xx)
* **Counterbalances Handstand work**:  it has become very fashionable to pair HS work with L-Sit work. What a poor choice! The best way to counterbalance the 180° shoulder flexion of the  Handstand is to select an exercise with 90° shoulder extension. In a  standard L-Sit, the arms are in an anatomical position (and the core is  50% compressed), which is why it is not a good exercise to pair with the  Handstand. A very good exercise to counterbalance the Handstand is... the  Reverse Plank, which requires 90° shoulder extension supported by full  scapular depression and retraction as opposed to the Handstand  biomechanics.

# The progressions

* To scale down:
   * Elevate your hands (ex: on a chair)
   * Bend your knees (Tuck Reverse Plank/Reverse Tabletop)
* To scale up:
   * Supinate your forearms
   * Elevate your feet until they are at shoulder level
* Logical progressions until the Manna: Reverse Tabletop > Reverse Plank > Supinated Reverse Plank > Supinated Elevated Reverse Plank > Wall Manna Slides > Assisted Manna work (many exercises here that would deserve a post on their own) > Manna
   * Do not forget to work on active core compression (Hanging/Lying Leg Raise): no core compression strength and mobility, no Manna... But also remembers that 90° shoulder extension strength is the most important component

# Common mistakes

I have heard several times guys saying that people tend to perform this exercise incorrectly (which is true), which outweights the benefits of the RP. The second part is absolutely not a valid argument! Any exercise can be performed poorly, that is not a reason not to exercise... Here are some tips to help you to correctly perform the RP:

* To have a good form, focus on forming a line with your body
* Do NOT bend your neck (for god sake), keep it neutral
* Do NOT overextend or flex your lower back, keep it flat (neutral)
* Do NOT supinate your forearms if you are just beginning RP work, keep it on the sides like on my picture at the beginning of the post. You can injure your elbows if you are not careful. Similarly, if you typically have wrist pain by performing Push-Ups, do not put your wrists in front of you. Again, the safest option is to keep them toward the sides and to listen to your body. If you have pain around the elbows or even shoulders, scale down!
* Keep the shoulder extension angle at 90°, this is neither a Reverse Planche Lean nor a German Hang on the ground

# How can you implement the RP in your training

* **Pair Reverse Plank work with Handstand work**: forget about the bloody L-Sit. Just after performing a Freestanding HS, perform a RP. As previously discussed, these exercises work antagonist shoulder and scapular muscles so they perfectly fit for pairing. Here is a video of me applying this principle: [https://www.instagram.com/p/BngKp6FAFQN/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BngKp6FAFQN/)
* Aim at **4 sets of 30 seconds** of RP with good form before scaling up
* The RP should primarly be considered as an **upper body exercise for straight arm strength development**, rather than a core exercise

# Your opinion

* What do you think of the RP?
* What is your experience with the RP and your personal observations?
* Did you find this post useful? Any suggestion? Any criticism? Any thing that you liked or did not like?
* Are you planning to include this exercise in your strength training sessions?

Hello everyone!

There are many reasons why r/bodyweightfitness is awesome but for me the number 1 reason is the no BS advice that is free for everyone. This is something that the fitness community in general seems to lack but not here. The recommended routine is one of the best free resources for anyone getting started with bodyweight training. This along with countless users who spend their own time helping out others for nothing in return. People like u/antranik , u/tykato , u/FitnessFAQs , u/eshlow  just to name a few.

The online bodyweight community has give me so much that I have devoted a lot of time over the past 18 months in trying to give something back [through my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/VitalityAndAgilityTV).

Now in 2017 this has all come together into my own personal recommended routines, **[The Bodyweight Warrior Program](https://payhip.com/b/Z0EN)**. A training template for various goals at various stages in this journey. A completely free guide to get people started and working towards there goals.

The eBook contains 3 programs:

* Beginners - Full body routine similar to the RR.
* Skill development - Split routine focused around developing bodyweight skills.
* Mass gain - Split routine focused on building a functional and aesthetic body through bodyweight training.

All 3 programs contain both example workouts and structures as well as a template for you to apply your own ability and goals to create your own program unique to you. Remember this eBook is not a final solution but a foundation for you to build upon.

I really hope you check out the program and most importantly get some value out of it that helps your training.

I've coached at a CrossFit gym all summer. My review of CrossFit,None,1816,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/coawhe/ive_coached_at_a_crossfit_gym_all_summer_my/,1565396481.0,"I'm not a crossfitter, I'm a very amateur gymnast, trained by gymnasts. I'd never done crossfit before I got this job. I unashamedly made fun of kipping crossfitters as long as I've known about Crossfit. 

WHAT IS CROSSFIT?

Overall I'd describe it as a type of circuit training that includes weight training, gymnastics, and (somewhat) high intensity cardio 



A normal Crossfit workout goes: 

- very active warmup (ball slams, assault bike hard etc), mobility work
- Skills drills and demonstration of a movement (either Olympic lift, big 5 lift, or gymnastics move)
- Work up to your current X rep max of the demonstrated movement
- Crossfit Workout of the Day (WOD), a weightlifting/cardio circuit 

PROS

- It's actually a really nice structure, the classes are extremely informative. I've learned a lot about lifting

- great community feel, you always see the same people and even though everyone's at a different level you've got the giant muscular chick clapping for beer-gut-Joe like he's the most god damn inspirational thing she's ever seen. 

- Good balance, it's pretty much all picking shit up and pushing it overhead (or for gymnastics, it's things like muscle ups). You don't have to worry about what muscle group you're gonna do today

- I know people make fun of crossfitters for getting injuries from all the kipping, but idk where those gyms are because there's no kipping going on unless you have a mastery of the basic move. I think it is a very good way to get non-athletes exercising and not at all unhealthy. 


CONS

- The WOD (workout of the day). The actual crossfit part... it's just kinda pointless. ""It's more volume, though"" ""It's for conditioning for general athleticism"" ""It's for cardio"". Maybe... but it's really just a cheap version of all of those packed into one. Like it's not really that great of a cardio session. It's only ~12min. It's not good volume -- the reps are super sloppy after like 5 min. I don't know that much about general conditioning so maybe there's benefit there? 

- Progress in the trainees is *really* slow. Let's say you go 3 days a week like most people. You did your 2RM of bench once. You did your 3RM of deadlift once. You did your 5RM of clean and snatch once. There's hardly any volume there and it shows. If you bench that day the WOD isn't necessarily gonna have benching, it's usually just a mashup of pullups, cardio, and cleans, and those reps are heavily diminished because you're doing them with no rest. 

FUNNY THINGS I NOTICED

- They really get a kick out of comparing their calluses. Tearing a callus is a major mark of pride

-  God damn these people are inflexible. I run them through the wrist warmup and these big muscular olympic lifters cannot believe my meager shoulder/wrist/hip mobility. 

- Things I take for granted in gymnastics are mind blowing to seasoned, very strong crossfitters. ""this is shoulder depression"" ""this is false grip"" ""this is how you increase ankle mobility""


SUMMARY

You can definitely make a program out of crossfit, and you can get in good shape doing crossfit. But I really think the Crossfit experience for 95% of the crossfit population is best summed up best by my boss's words when he hired me:  **""look, just make em sweaty and out of breath.""**

Don't tell r/crossfit I made this post

EDIT: I was trained by the gym in all things CrossFit and lifting, but not sent to get certified. Most of the people who attend the gym are far from athletic, so I rarely teach higher level skills

Exactly 1 year apart progress My Rant on body weight fitness,None,1812,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hekerz/exactly_1_year_apart_progress_my_rant_on_body/,1592938023.0,"https://imgur.com/gallery/4TRuh4P

This is my progress exactly 1 year apart from each other from when I started working out to right now

A few feats of strength I’ve achieved within calisthenics in a year are- HSPU, 90 degree HSPU, Straddle Planche, Back Lever, L sit, Muscle Up, Pistol Squat, One handed Push-up, Human Flag, and I’m currently working on my front lever, the full planche, one handed pull-up, and hefesto curls

I’ve been working out from the start with calisthenics and weight lifting, I’m thinking of switching completely to calisthenics because of how much I enjoy it, calisthenics really humbles you and makes you grow as a person, did to me at least. aesthetics don’t really matter but they are definitely a part of working out, what matters is that you are healthy and happy calisthenics definitely gives me both of these and has shown me role models it has made my life better. If you’re sad rep it out, if you’re happy rep it out, if you’re bored rep it out, and when it starts to hurt REP IT OUT

My workout; I switch it up ALOT because theirs a million ways of working out with calisthenics but it has always consisted of “The Foundation” and static training and whatever else I find fun! Remember to always tailor your workout towards your goals right now I’m doing the foundation exercises and incorporating FL HSPU BL and Planche training in it

My diet; I lost 30+ lbs of fat, I tried fasting, worked tremendously but I couldn’t maintain it this helped me loose ~ 15 pounds I don’t fast anymore unless I need to , then completely not eating fast food helped me drop more, anything I ate at home was cheaper and better, I’ve started not to enjoy fast food, yes it taste good for 5 minutes and then you feel guilty because you just ate shit, when I go out I go for the healthiest but tastiest option like chicken sandwiches, I never buy salads when going out cuz going to a McDonald’s for a salad is like going to a hooker for a hug. Anyways let’s not use diet anymore because it’s even in the name it DIE-s , my nutrition plan is basically the Greg doucette plan (VOLUME EATING)- Wraps, Salads, Popcorn, IceCream, Oatmeal (my absolute favorite food), lava cakes, protein bars, as a picky eater for like 10+ years this nutrition plan is the best. Intuitive eating is a nono Mindful eating is a yes yes remember the most important thing is your caloric intake and protein get protein in every meal if you can.

Why I began working out; Anime inspired me every single anime character that I have admired does some sort of calisthenics and you’re the hero of your own story so why not become strong? I’ve began to believe that calisthenics is true strength... besides if you can’t lift up your own body why should you start lifting iron? But in all seriousness anime and me just wanting to not feel like shit is what inspired me to do something

Tips to beginners: start before it’s too late, what I mean is start before your health is truly at risk, obesity kills. Another tip Do what you enjoy maybe it’s CrossFit, maybe weights, or like me calisthenics do something that doesn’t feel like a workout something you enjoy! Another tip don’t fuck with your legs just do normal squats (this may be controversial but hear me out) do one or two SAFE exercises that hit your entire lower body, don’t do any pistol squats or sissy squats because your knees are at risk, blah if you use proper form blah I would personally say not worth it even with proper form you want to keep your knees trust me on this one. Last but not least don’t neglect cardio the heart is the most important muscle, do it at-least twice a week for like 15 minutes

Edit: Thanks for the Gold award it’s my first award ever! Never really expected my first award to be in a post like this! I thought I was going to post a meme or something and get an award... THANKS SO MUCH

"First knee, yes, knee pushup.",LazerBeanBoi,1812,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/sgqiiy/first_knee_yes_knee_pushup/,1643598034.0,"Yesterday marked the day I did my very first knee pushup with proper form. Chest very lightly touched the ground and pushed up. It was hard.

I've posted here before so some may know that I'm overweight. I have lost 43lbs so far and I've been training but have recently discovered a minor chest tear from doing too much. After lengthly physiotherapy sessions, I've recovered and began training again.

And yes, I know this milestone is...well not even a milestone for some. But damn I felt so cool. It was like for a brief moment, I realized my efforts aren't going in vain. 

I like to think of it as a stairway to heaven (heaven being my goal). With each successful day of maintaining a calorie deficit and exercising, I am one step closer to the goal.

Just thought I'd put this here.

Edit: holy shit the responses. I just want to say thank you to everyone for the kind words. This is a very supportive community and it's nice to see people who understand that everyone starts from somewhere. That being said, I'm not gonna get full of myself. I'm aware that there's many more challenges down the road and there will always be temptations to quit. Hell I've quit many times in the past. But every time I dusted myself off and kept going. And it's certainly a lot easier when others are there to help.

Edit 2: HOLY FUCKING SHIT I DID 3 I DID 3 ITS WORKING ITS ACTUALLY WORKING I have it recorded too so one day I can look back and be one happy boy.

Edit 3: Yoo thank you so much for the platinum award!

Edit 4: 1.6k upvotes yay. Also just want to point out that this post was probably the best decision I've made in a while. In so happy to see us supporting each other. Honestly it sometimes brings tears to my eyes. Lowkey I was scared of getting absolutely shit on by gigachads who can pushup with their balls or something. But anyways, these lovely comments have boosted my motivation to such heights I don't want to give up, ever. Mark my words, friends! I will post here again and I will reach my goal. You have my upmost support in reaching yours too!"
70 Days BWF Transformation 22/M/5'6,None,1809,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qzqwsk/70_days_bwf_transformation_22m56/,1637602666.0,"I recently  took advantage of the work from home situation  and lost  6 pounds going  from  169 lbs  to 163 lbs 

I have always had a bad relationship with food.

I achieved this transformation  with only bodyweight exercises and have cut out sugar and fried foods from my life.
I would honestly say diet was more important than specific exercises but I want to show what can be achieved without weights .

 My  routine consisted of  variations  of pushups  , pullups , bodyweight squats , dips, , leg raises and athleanx , ab exercises , box jumps  and skipping  

Every morning after I wake up and every night before I sleep I do a 2min plank , 25 pushups and 25 squats . 

I am addicted to the results . I feel great and I plan to start using dumbells for isolation exercises soon as I am finding my biceps and shoulders lacking immensely . 

I don't have a pic of my legs here but I've always had big legs so heavy squats would cause major issues for me clothing wise.

"Getting Started: A Beginner's Guide to Building Strength, Flexibility, and Motor Control through Bodyweight Training before starting any type of Exercise Routine.",s_shivam,1805,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/by64bu/getting_started_a_beginners_guide_to_building/,1559984954.0,"Hey r/bodyweightfitness

I came across a pdf book -56 pages, which also includes links & videos for proper guidance from GMB (Gold Medal Bodies)  (link is down below) that guides on Basic Elements of Strength, Flexibility, Movement, and Control over your body which is very very important to build before you start any kind of exercise routine like Bodyweight Training, Weight Lifting, Crossfit, HIIT (high intensity training), Martial arts, or any kind of workout.

I think before even starting any form of exercise/ workout one should have flexibility, strength, mobility, and control over their own body.

For example,

1. If you wanna do or start 'PUSH-UPS' you must have strong and flexible wrists to hold yourself steady, and an appropriately strong core to keep your back straight. Your triceps, shoulders, stomach, back, legs and hips need to be strong enough and coordinated to allow you to move into to the start of the push up with control. Push-ups requires all of that plus the addition of controlling it all in motion.

2. Let's take 'HANDSTAND',  for example, most people say a one minute handstand hold is a basic towards progression and getting expert at that. But that's not really true. A one minute handstand hold can't really be called a ""basic"" because the handstand itself is built upon other components. Working on your wrists, opening your shoulders, and strengthening your core and hips are the true basics of the handstand hold - not the hold itself and not a number pulled out of thin air.

An appropriate amount of strength, flexibility, and motor control has to be developed before even starting on the exercise itself. 

So choose your fundamental areas of training as strength, flexibility movement and motor control. Then after building your fundamentals strong you can follow any bodyweight training routines/ Programs that you wanna follow. I really think that no matter what your fitness goals are it will really help you to build up, maintain overall strength & control over your body & take your fitness goals to the next level.

The world is reopening. For the past 3 months, I’ve given away almost 10,000 copies of the BWF Journal. I’ve had covid myself, it took me 10 weeks to feel well again. I had a blood test a couple weeks ago which the nurse did a terrible job of, which has left me with ongoing circulatory problems and pain in my left arm. My future employment looks uncertain. As such I’ve decided to charge again for the journal download, to cover the site hosting costs etc. 2020 has been a wild ride so far! Stay safe out there
**END OF EDIT**

Hi all, in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the absolute shit storm the world is facing right now, I’ve made the Bodyweight Fitness Journal free to download for all, from 

http://bodyweightfitnessjournal.com 

The journal helps track the excellent r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine

I understand most people are gonna be stuck at home, as is the responsible thing to do, so hopefully this will help you still get after some gains without having to / being able to go to the gym etc.

If you found this useful and are so inclined, please consider making a donation, however small, to the World Health Organisation’s COVID responde fund charity, here (please DM me if there are better charities to support):

https://www.covid19responsefund.org

Instructions:
You might need to use a browser instead of the Reddit app to download the journal. The journal is FREE, but don’t click the PayPal / ApplePay etc options as it can try to charge £0.01. I don’t get this money. The easiest way for me to share this, and make use of the platform I’ve already paid for, was to change the price of the journal download to £0.00

I finally achieved the muscle up at age 38. It’s never too late!,DadBodyweightfitness,1790,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nw7x8d/i_finally_achieved_the_muscle_up_at_age_38_its/,1623277037.0,"I’ve been practicing bodyweight fitness for a little over a year now, primarily on rings. The rings muscle up was one of dream goals and today I finally did my first one! And then 3 more because I couldn’t believe it. 

I am very grateful for this sub for keeping me motivated and providing tons of tips and suggestions. 

Here are the 3 tips that really helped me:

False grip training - my false grip was really, really week. So I focused a lot on false grip hangs, rows, and pull-ups. 

Weighted pull-ups - my max bodyweight pull-up count was 15 but I had never tried weighted pull-ups until recently. So I loaded up some weights on a chain until I could only do 6. 

Pull-up assistance band - I used this to help train the transition. It helped to psychologically motivate me and build that muscle memory and technique. Even the first time I did a band-assisted MU I was ecstatic!

Just a couple weeks ago I was seriously discouraged and thought I would never reach my goal. I’m so happy I stuck with it and am excited to keep improving. Good luck to anyone still struggling on this skill!"

I thought that was because as it was my first time doing it my core was not ready, but hell no; today, without any warm up I did the exercise for a little bit longer than yesterday for telling if it just happened because I had never done it; I keept holding it thinking it would just fade away like in some exercises you kinda feel a stretch that then fades away, but hell no, without even being excited or horny I nut myself, wtf.

I have read that it is a coregasm and the only way to avoiding this is not doing the things that causes it, so; am I doomed to never being able to train the FL??"
The Most Important Muscle No One Trains: The Lower Back (Here's How to Train It),BarSeraph,1778,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8coqsa/the_most_important_muscle_no_one_trains_the_lower/,1523895473.0,"I know us calisthenics guys and girls (including myself) are pretty lazy when it comes to training our lower backs, but it's actually super important. Training your lower back will help you to learn more advanced skills like the back lever and human flag because it will help strengthen your core enough to be able to withstand the burden that is placed on it during these extreme positions. Most people think of just training the abs when it comes to training their core, however your lower back is a big part of what makes up your core strength, so it's crucial that you train it so that you can both progress quickly and also avoid injury. **Hannibal for King even said in an interview that he regrets not training his lower back enough, and that not training it caused him significant injury** ([link here to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn802bPSEtw) - skip to 21:16). 







It's pretty difficult to explain how to work your lower back via text post, so that's why I have included a link to the video (which I've seen other people do on this subreddit). My favourites from this video are:



**Lower Back Raises** (they're like reverse leg raises, but instead of working your abs they're working your lower back. You lay down on a bench face-down with your legs hanging off the edge and raise your legs up into the air)



**Lower Back Kick-Outs** (again, laying face down with your legs hanging off a bench, bring your knees in and out and you will be able to feel it in your lower back)



**Lower Back Static Hold** (once again, laying face-down with legs off the bench, raise your legs until they form a straight line with your upper body and hold your legs there. This is a great one because it is a static hold, which will make learning lever skills (i.e. back lever, human flag, front lever) easier because you're getting your core used to holding your legs away from your body. 



What other lower back exercises do you guys find useful? I'd love to hear and get a discussion going so we can all learn from each so we can get stronger and stay injury feree! These ones are really good, so I hope at least one person finds them useful - thank you :D"

Ohhhh so many. Forearm Splints, Tendonitis, Chronic Neck pain, Sprained Shoulder, and a few skateboard falls.

8 months total of these past 36 months I haven’t been able to train because of these injuries.

I regressed basically back to scratch at the end of 2019 (1.5 years into training).

It's given me a new respect for how precious strength is, how hard it is to actually make it to an elite level, and a lot of knowledge on how to rehab myself.

# How I train:

***\*My exact training plan is on the bottom of the Stats sheet*** [***here***](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NO_TGZwDbi8AMXnd6AOZ55X2SFIH2mQNS5EAjsh7d0c/edit?usp=sharing)***\****

***Split***: Upper/Lower split for the past year. This year, weekly frequency is every 3 days, so a little bit more than twice a week. I don't train legs that consistently, usually only once per week, sometimes less...

***Handstands***: 1-4 times a week, 15-60 min, right before upper-body sessions, after leg training, or when I feel fresh on off days. There is no structure to my handstand training, which I think is hindering my progress (need to fix this moving forward)

***Flexibility***: Usually, train flexibility during/after leg days or before Handstand training. I’ve been very inconsistent with flexibility this year compared to previous years.

***Strength Training Ideology:***

I train with a loose structure and keep a focus on RPE/RIR and periodization. If that sounds complicated, it’s basically going a few reps shy of my limits at the beginning of a training cycle, then adding reps/difficulty weekly, to get to something I can barely do. Rinse and repeat.

I say loose training structure because I’m very willing to break away from the plan if I’m feeling weak or particularly sore with an exercise. I don’t do this with my main pushing or pulling exercise, but I’ve found that being flexible with the rest of my plan helps me manage my fatigue and DOMs much better. (I would not suggest this for beginners, <1 year of training)

Long story short, started around 180lbs/81.5kg. Lost about 10lbs/4kg in my first 3 months of training. I've pretty much been low 170lbs/77kgs when training. I gained a lot of weight when I had injuries and stopped training. (\~10lbs/4kg)

Also, I’m eating Gluten Free as of this year! Never thought I would say that, but I was having a ton of problems with digestion, IBS, and other things all of 2020. I had hemorrhoids that made it very uncomfortable for me to walk, stretch, work out, live life since January of 2020. I tried cutting out dairy and a few other random things, but nothing worked for me until I went gluten-free at the beginning of 2021. It didn’t have much of an effect on my weight or anything else in my life other than fixing those digestion problems and making it much more comfortable for me to live my life.

***Am I celiac?***

No (as far as I know), my stomach just doesn't agree with gluten anymore. If I was on a deserted island with only bread to eat, I would make it work. But if I have the option, gluten-free will make my life easier 100% of the time.

***Do I track Calories?***

Only for about a month out of the year, usually in April or May, so I know I have a good understanding of what I’m eating and what macros I’m under on. (Always low on protein and high on Fat & Sodium) Aiming for 2800 calories when I’m trying to maintain/cut.

***Do I eat Healthy?***

Not always, I enjoy getting take out (Probably average once a week). I also have a frozen/premade meal a few times a week. Other than that, I eat fairly clean.

***Am I naturally Lean?***

Yes, I have always been lean most of my life. Before I started calisthenics in 2018, I was starting to gain weight, but I was basically only playing video games and eating trash food for years before, so I was bound to start putting on weight at some point.

***Am I Vegan?***

No, but I've started using much more meat alternatives this year. About 25% of my meals are vegan now. Pretty much all my breakfast meals are as well. It makes me feel better about my impact on the environment and I still enjoy what I'm eating, so why not do it as much as I can.

***Supplements?***

Creatine and protein powder. Both pretty much every day.

# What got me started with Calisthenics:

Who knows who Mike Boyde is? A few years ago I came across his learn to muscle up video on youtube. Not going to lie, it almost brought a tear to my eye at the end of the video. I had so much respect for his achievement and it motivated me to create my own success. I went down a rabbit hole on ThenX’s videos. Then, I found people that were informative and helpful like FitnessFAQ’s and Tom Merrick, and the rest is history…

# Current Goals:

1. Front Lever Pull Up with perfect form (youtube series about this already started)
2. Multiple reps of Handstand Push Up
3. Fingertip supported One arm Handstands (10+ seconds)

# Youtube:

If you want to support what I do, by far the best way to do it is by interacting with the channel so if you’d like to check it out, [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgar25QJHH16fk0sHf4fc9w/featured).

Video version of this post (8 min) - [here](https://youtu.be/Vd7cvaNyp9Q). I'd love for you to watch it, I put a lot of thought and time into it. It contains a lot of training footage over the past 3 years, and highlights all the ups and downs of my journey.

I started the channel 8 months ago that currently has a little over 700 subscribers at the time of posting this. I have been consistently uploading Calisthenics-related content every other week. I also started a road to Front Lever pull-ups series that will have a new episode very soon!

# Questions:

You have questions, I have answers (probably).

Seriously, I’m obviously quite obsessed with calisthenics, so I love talking about it. I’ll answer as many questions as I can, so shoot away."

TL/DR: [Pull up progression side by side](https://imgur.com/a/JitGHTY)

Background 

This place has been a HUGE source of inspiration and education for me over the past year. 

I was pretty healthy and active for most of my adult life. Got to my late 30s and a bunch of shit; kids, work, drinking, etc…started to take priority over wellness….And I gained weight…a lot of it. 

By last year I was [281 pounds ](https://imgur.com/a/ZIo0DM6). I’m not entirely sure what finally clicked in me, but something, and I proceeded to lose 100lb in like 9 months, by eating whole foods, counting calories, exercising, and starting body weight exercises in my house. 

When I started my ‘journey’ I could do 8 (total) push ups and ZERO pull ups. 

I learned about greasing the groove here, and started to do it, with push ups and pull ups, while losing weight…

Push ups were easy(ish)…I’d do sets of 8, then 10, then 15, then 20, etc…throughout the day, whenever I felt inspired. Now I do sets of 43 (my age), and on push up days I do 7-10 sets…

Pull ups were WAY harder, cause at the beginning I couldn’t do any. But as the weight fell off, and I kept trying…eventually I could do 1, then 2, then 3…but they were HARD, and I didn’t make much progress for like 6 months. 

In February I more or less reached [a weight I was happy with](https://imgur.com/a/okuYwo1), and started to focus more on getting stronger. 

At the time, I could do 3 strict pull ups…progress continued slowly, and now I can do 10. They’re not perfect, and I still have a long way to go, but I’m proud of my accomplishment and want everyone out there who’s over weight or can’t do a pull up to know that it’s possible, that you can do it, and that all it takes is time, patience, and determination. 

This is me [now](https://imgur.com/a/O8bBR1J). I’ll be 44 in a few weeks, and I’m in the best shape I’ve been in since college, over 20 years ago. 

I eat clean, with a few splurge days here and there, I hike with my dog, I ride a Peloton bike and mountain bike, and I do a lot of push ups and pull ups…and that’s about it. 

Thanks again for the guidance along the way!!

"Pike Pushups are an excellent progression exercise toward Handstand Pushups but difficult to setup for consistency AND execute with proper form, so here's my very comprehensive tutorial (with gifs!) to help you succeed!",Antranik,1704,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/b2z06d/pike_pushups_are_an_excellent_progression/,1553010432.0,"## Link to blog post here: https://antranik.org/pike-pushups/

As a fun experiment, I did Pike Pushups as the only progression exercise to see how many it would take to translate to a single Handstand Pushup (HSPU). I documented that entire journey in a 3 part series on my blog [here](https://antranik.org/tag/hspu/) and as I got intimately acquainted with this exercise, I started to put together all the things I learned along the way to help you succeed with it too! So in this post I will point out what is proper form & how to set yourself up for consistency, so here goes!

###Pike pushups are more technical to setup and execute than expected

* Changing any single one variable can make the exercise seem a lot easier or harder so having a consistent setup is crucial for success. And because it’s a difficult exercise, it’s easy to do it with bad form without even realizing the body is taking shortcuts. 
* Some people find pike pushups so frustrating to master that they resort to doing the barbell equivalent, the overhead press, because they can incrementally increase the load on the bar with far fewer variables to deal with. I’m here to help you to not experience that frustration.

###Pike pushups done with proper form are deceptively hard.

* I mean like, *really* hard. It's very difficult to perform them with proper form. *So hard in fact that most demonstrations on YouTube are shown with poor form.* 

* **[GIF: Demonstration of Pike Pushup](https://gfycat.com/bronzepositiveiberiannase)** 

#*Section 1: How to do Pike Pushups with Proper Form*

**Form Check #1: Just like with normal pushups, the elbows should not be flaring out to the sides**

* Since this is a progression exercise toward handstand pushups, it's important to note that a real handstand pushup will never be performed with the elbows flaring outwards. As such, during pike pushups, the forearms or elbows shouldn't be moving backwards or flaring out to the sides as well. They should remain vertical and fairly static.

* To facilitate this, turn the hands out slightly so the index finger faces forward. You can even make it more extreme so the thumb faces forward if your wrists are bothered.

* **[GIF: Bad Form / Good Form, Front View](https://gfycat.com/ifr/ElectricOddballFly)**

**Form Check #2: Your head should go MUCH MORE FORWARD than you think is enough**

* This is definitely the #1 offender of all: people dip their head down to go between their hands. No. Stop that. The head should not go down between your hands. The head should go *forward* and down. So far forward that your head ends up ahead of the fingers. So far forward that the elbows don't move backwards whatsoever but maybe they even go forward a teensy bit when you're even stronger. 

* When in doubt, go more ahead than you think you can. (In any harder variation, like a hollowback press or bent arm planche, your head will need to go even more forward.)

* **[GIF: Bad Form / Good Form, Side View](https://gfycat.com/ifr/ThisVacantFalcon)**

* What happens if you put your head straight down between the hands? The elbows flare out to the sides and it increases the strain on the elbow and shoulder joints. You'll be able to do more reps with this improper form, misleading you to think that you're stronger than you actually are. (Remember, this exercise is deceptively hard when done right.)

**Form Check #3: Your nose should touch the ground**

* Rather than aiming for the top of the head to touch the ground, have the nose touch it. You get more range that way.

**Form Check #4: Practice full range of motion (ROM)**

* This goes without saying. Press up until arms are straight and the shoulders are over the wrists.

#*Section 2: How To Set Yourself Up For Consistency*

**Setup Tip #1: Start with (Feet-Elevated) Decline Pike Pushups**

* Doing pike pushups with feet on the ground is OK but I suggest you start with decline pike pushups where the feet are slightly elevated. This will mitigate any hamstring flexibility issues and make the exercise feel less awkward.

* Even if the flexibility is not an issue, I highly recommend it. Also, one should be comfortable with regular pushups.

* If you have been doing pushups properly, [the way I recommend,](https://youtu.be/4dF1DOWzf20) then you have a solid base.

**Setup Tip#2: The hands should be about shoulder width apart**

* Setting the hands far wider than shoulder width will feel easier because there's less range of motion.
* Setting the hands narrower than shoulder width will feel very difficult and is an advanced variant.
* Keep the hands at around shoulder width apart for optimum range and intensity.

**Setup Tip #3: Choose an object you could elevate your feet on and stick to that height**

* I put my feet on a chair (about knee height) and did that for 6 weeks minimum before elevating the feet onto the couch (about hip height) and doing that for 6 weeks.

* **[Pic: Left: Feet elevated to knee height \(on a chair\) is about 77% of my bodyweight. Right: With feet at hip height \(on couch\), this is about 83% intensity.
](https://i.imgur.com/e3ywcH3.jpg)**

* The difference between the above settings for the feet is only ~6% which doesn't sound like much, but it is considering the chair-setting is already quite difficult at ~77% intensity so don't start at the highest possible setting. This exercise is humbling. The height of the feet should be the same for a while.

**Setup Tip #4: Place the feet near the edge of the platform**

* When I was using a chair, I would make sure my feet were placed right near the edge of the chair. If I placed the feet further back, toward the middle of the chair, the exercise would be far easier.

* When I elevated the feet to hip height, I was using the side of my couch. Luckily, arm-rest was narrow so I couldn't set my feet too far back or forth.)

**Setup Tip #5: If using a movable object to put your feet on, always place them in the same spot.**

* When I was using a chair, I would place the legs of the chair exactly at the edge of the carpet each and every time. Then, my feet would go at the end of the chair and my hands would go on the same spot on the carpet everytime. And finally, when doing the actual pushup, my nose would always hit the same spot on the carpet as well.

* **[GIF: Example of what constitutes a Consistent Setup](https://gfycat.com/ifr/PortlyImpureItalianbrownbear)**

**Setup Tip #6: Use a landmark for where your nose should touch for each and every rep.**

* Do this to ensure you're going forward enough. On the carpet, I chose a pattern to aim for. One inch forward or backward makes a huge difference so I always made sure I was going forward enough

* On a smooth floor, I use a piece of invisible tape to mark the spot.

* **[Example Pic: This is how I chose to remember where to place my hands and nose each time.](https://i.imgur.com/6vazB47.jpg)**

**Setup Tip #7: The distance of the hands from the feet should always be the same.**

* Setup the hands close enough to almost be an L-shape, but not tighter than an L-shape. (This was a distance of about 36"" (1 meter) for me. Your mileage may vary.)

**Setup Tip #8: Don't place the hands too close to your feet even if your flexibility allows for it.**

* The closer you bring the hands to the feet, the harder the exercise becomes. So you might think closer is better to maximize the intensity. But it's not the best course of action for consistency sake because placing your hands further back makes the exercise exponentially harder as mere millimeters change the load *significantly*.

* If your hamstring flexibility and pike compression is great and you can compress yourself tighter than an L-shape, you may be tempted to make the exercise harder by simply moving your hands backwards, but the inconsistency can cause frustration and make you think you're weak, so don't do it.

* Note: I'm not saying you should NEVER bring your hands close. Eventually, you will be able to place your feet close to your hands, do a pike pushup and lift your feet up and press up into a handstand. You can even ""teeter totter"" like that if you stay piked and are obscenely strong. But you need to choose a setting that's going to help you get the reps in.

#Tempo Tips

* **[GIF: Demo of Appropriate Tempo to Aim For](https://gfycat.com/ifr/CreativeCourageousDragonfly)**

* **Don't rush the negative phase.**
 * Slow down the negative phase so it takes a solid 2-3 seconds rather than just one second or less. In doing so you build more strength and make better use of your time.
* **Pause at the bottom occasionally**
 * This strengthens you in the hardest part of the exercise and forces you to press up using all your strength without utilizing the elastic nature of your muscular tissues because you made all the potential energy dissipate from pausing.
* **Explode up with good form**
 *  In the beginning it was hard to push quickly. It was actually impossible. But the intention is what matters. I tried to pushup as fast as possible and although it was slow, it got slowly faster. It wasn't until exactly one month into the training where I was pushing actually faster for the first time during the concentric phase. After 3 months, I could feel the quality of my strength had changed dramatically. I could muster through reps where otherwise it would've failed in the past and perform the concentric faster than ever.

So there you have it! Your comprehensive guide toward tackling the pike pushups! If you have any questions and comments, please let me know!

Confused by all the fitness terms? I wrote up a BWF glossary,HandstandAddict,1693,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cnzs21/confused_by_all_the_fitness_terms_i_wrote_up_a/,1565341596.0,"Hey guys, HandstandAddict here.  

If you're new to bwf, you're probably overwhelmed by all of the specific terms you see around here and in the [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine).  

Although it's impossible to cover everything in one post, I've written out the most commonly used ones here.  
_______________________
General Fitness Terms

**Reps** (Repetitions)  - How many times you complete a specific exercise.  

*Ex)  I did 10 reps of pushups = I did 10 pushups.*

**Sets** - The amount of cycles you do of a certain exercise, with rest in between each attempt. 

*Ex)  I did 3 sets of 10 pushups today = I did 10 pushups, rested, did another 10 pushups, rested, then did another 10 pushups.*

**Sets x Reps** - An easier way of writing out how many sets and reps you do.  First number is always amount of 'sets'.  Second number is always amount of 'reps'.

*Ex) 3x5 pushups = 3 sets of 5 pushups*

Set 1 - 5 pushups

Set 2 - 5 pushups

Set 3 - 5 pushups

*5x3 pushups = 5 sets of 3 pushups*

Set 1 - 3 pushups

Set 2 - 3 pushups

Set 3 - 3 pushups

Set 4 - 3 pushups

Set 5 - 3 pushups

**Volume** - The total amount of work you do for a given muscle group or exercise.  Generally, more volume means better results, though too much volume can be an issue as well.  

*Ex) I did high volume pull ups last week = I did a large number of pull ups last week.*

**Intensity** - The difficulty of the exercise based on how much you can maximally lift/move.  

*Ex) High intensity bench press = Bench pressing with close to maximum amount of weight you can handle.*

*Low intensity bench press = Bench pressing with a relatively light amount of weight*

**Failure** - When you physically can't complete a rep of an exercise anymore due to muscle (not mental) exhaustion.  

*Ex) I did squats until failure  = I did squats until I physically couldn't anymore.*

**Hypertrophy** - Increase in muscle size.  

*Ex)  I'm doing pushups for hypertrophy = I'm doing pushups to increase the size of my muscles.*

**Concentric** - The part of the exercise when the muscle contracts.

*Ex) Pushup concentrics = The part of the pushup where you push up off the floor.*

*Pullup concentrics = The part of the pullup where you pull yourself up to the bar.*

**Eccentric** - The part of the exercise when the muscle lengthens.  

*Ex) Pushup eccentrics = The part of the pushup where you lower down towards the floor.*

*Pullup eccentrics = The part of the pullup where you lower down to hanging.*

**Negatives** - Exercises that focus on the eccentric half of a movement.  Negatives are easier than the full version of the exercise and are used as a stepping stone to the real thing.  Negatives are especially useful for stuff like dips, pullups, and pushups if you can't complete one yet.  

*Ex) I'm working on pull up negatives = I'm working on the lowering down part of the pull up.*

**Static Holds** - Exercises that involve using muscle to hold a specific body position without moving.  

*Ex) Planche, ring support, and hollowbody holds are all examples of static holds.*

**Dynamics** - Exercises that involve using muscle to create movement.  

*Ex) Pushups, pullups, and leg raises are all examples of dynamic movements.*  

**Pronate** - Turning the hand so that it faces downwards. 

*Ex) Pullups use a pronated grip = The hands are face downward in a pullup*

**Supinate** - Turning the hand so that it to faces upwards. 

*Ex) Chinups use a supinated grip = The hands face up during a chinup*

**Extension** - Movement that increases the angle between two body parts. 

*Ex) Extending the elbow = straightening out the elbow*

**Flexion** - Movement that reduces the angle between two body parts. 

*Ex) Flexing the elbow = bending the elbow*
______________________________________

Workout Routine Terms

**Dropset** - Doing a second set with less weight/resistance than the first set.  This is a strategy to be able to add more volume to your routine.  

*Ex) Set 1 = Bench press with 100lbs added*

*Set 2 = Bench press with 90lbs added*

**Superset** - Doing two different exercises one after another without resting in between.  This is commonly used to either save time or add a cardio component to the workout.  

*Ex) I did Pullups supersetted with Pushups = I did pushups immediately after doing pullups without stopping to rest.*

**PPL** - Push Pull Legs.  A common workout routine that separates push, pull, and leg exercises into different days.

*Ex) Day 1 = Push exercises*

*Day 2 = Pull exercises*

*Day 3 = Leg exercises*

**Deload** - Lowering the amount of weight/resistance to avoid overtraining.  Used by more intermediate practitioners as a way to reduce cumulative fatigue caused by long periods of hard training.  

*Ex) I'm deloading next week = I'm taking it easy next week so that my body has a chance to recover.*  

**Periodization** - The creation of a long term training plan which focuses on progression over a period of time. Generally used by more advanced trainees.  

*Ex) Linear periodization - A training plan that gradually increases intensity and decreases volume over time.*

*Non-linear periodization - A training plan that frequently changes up different aspects of a training program on a regular basis.*

_____________________________
Acronyms

**CNS** - Central Nervous System.  The connection between your brain and your body.  

*Ex)  Doing too many pullups fries my CNS  = Doing too many pullups makes me mentally tired.*  

**GTG** - Greasing the Groove.  A training method where you practice a specific exercise multiple times throughout the day in order to train your central nervous system.  The idea is to do it a few times every couple of hours without hitting failure in order to increase volume.  

*Ex) An example of GTG is doing a few pullups every time you pass by a pullup bar over your door.*  

**AMRAP** - As Many Reps As Possible

*Ex) Pushups AMRAP = Doing as many pushups as possible until you can't anymore.*

**1RM** - One Rep Max 

*Ex) My 1RM for bench press is 200lbs = The maximum amount of weight I can lift for bench press is 200 lbs.*

**BF%** = Body Fat Percentage

*Ex) My BF% is about 15% = I have about 15% bodyfat.*  

**PR** - Personal Record.  The most amount of weight or reps that someone has personally done.  

*Ex) My PR for pull ups is 20 times. = The most amount of pull ups I can do at once is 20.*

**ROM** - Range of Motion.  The distance that a joint or limb travels during an exercise.

*Ex) Make sure you're doing full ROM for pullups = Make sure you do pullups all the way up and all the way down.*

*I saw a guy doing partial ROM squats = I saw a guy doing squats without going all the way down.*   

**RPE** - Rate of Perceived Exertion.  It's a measure of how hard you feel your body is working.  The scale goes from 1-10 with 1 being almost no effort and 10 being pushed to your absolute limits.  

*Ex) I tried doing 5x3 today and my RPE was about an 8 = I did 5 sets of 3 reps today and it felt pretty hard.*  

**RR** - [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine).  The most commonly recommended beginner routine on /r/bodyweightfitness.   It is located on the sidebar to the right on PC or in the ""Menu"" tab on mobile.  

*Ex) If you're new, just follow the RR =  If you're new, just follow the Recommended Routine.*

Finally did 20 pushups in a row,AlpineDyno,1676,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/df7s7o/finally_did_20_pushups_in_a_row/,1570574928.0,"A lot of backstory, about 4 years ago I broke my back. For those of you who know what this is, it was a pars defect ""stress fracture"" of my 5th Lumbar vertebrae. I was 16 at the time and had been a year-round athlete of 2 sports. 

The doc basically said he didn't know if the injury was congenital or caused by swimming (sport #1), and that I wouldn't be able to swim MY strokes again, let alone climb (sport #2). I was devastated, as I had been swimming for nearly a decade and wanted to go to college for the sport. The doc also said I wouldn't deadlift, squat, or lift any weights again for the rest of my life (he was being dramatic, yes, but to naive me, it was world-shattering). 

I didn't do anything but rest for 2 entire months, which resulted in a crazy amount of lost swimming and climbing gainz. Then I got into PT, where the focus was on core strength, as the ""plan of action"" was to strengthen my core so much that it was basically keep my fractured vertebrae in place at all times. I did basic stuff like pelvic tilt, pelvic clock, and breathing exercises for weeks, building a foundation for my core. 
Then I got into medicine ball stuff, leg lifts, planks, and lower back stuff. It was great to finally get back to doing semi-normal stuff, as my life had been solely centered around exercise prior to the injury. 

This is how I found calisthenics... 

I loved the feeling of having a strong core — strong enough to basically keep my back from ""slipping out of place"" (it was extremely painful when my lumbar would essentially hinge like a book). I basically took the exercises I had from PT and did them every day, multiple times a day, and got really quick results. 
I wanted to do more, so I looked up body weight core exercises online and BOOM, the rest was history. 

After an extremely solid core foundation was built, I started with L sit training and had a full, palm to ground, 24 second L-sit in 2 months. Then I basically did what you all did/will do and went crazy. I added weights. I did muscle ups, hand stands, I started tricking. I swam again and got back to the times I had before I was injured. I sent harder than I ever did in climbing. Life was great...

Until I injury my right rotator cuff from swimming and climbing (both a similar movement anatomically). This put me out of anything press or pull or overhead related for 9 months. It did get better, but then it got much worse. Then better again, and then recently (February 2019) it got worse again. For these 2-ish years of rotator cuff problems I was extremely inconsistent with my body weight training and went from advanced planche tucks for 11 seconds to 4 sketchy pushups and a lot of pain.
However, after a lot of patience and a lot of ""sucking it up"", I have reached a point where my shoulder is healthy enough to semi- consistently train all muscle groups again. 

Today, my shoulder was feeling sore and I am a little worried about it, but I said fuck it and did some pushups to feel it out (if it was soreness vs. pain). To my surprise I did 20 pushups in a row! 
This is not much compared to most if not all of you, and it certainly isn't much compared to the amount I used to do (with +50kg). 
But, it's a starting point, and I am extremely proud and emotional about it. 

Tl;Dr: I broke my back and found calisthenics while in PT, I loved bodyweight so much I became a BW junkie and got strong. Then I messed up and injured my rotator cuff, put me out of anything BW for nearly 2 years, but now I'm back and feel great!"

The good news is that there are still plenty of great home leg exercises and squat variations you can perform with little to no equipment (and a splash of creativity). 

You’ll already find some great base progressions in the RR, so I recommend checking that out if you haven’t already. In this post, I thought I’d list everything available, alongside some alternatives that you can incorporate into your at-home leg workout.

Note - this is just squat variations. I'll put together another guide on hinge-dominant movements at some point if that would be helpful.

# 🏋️‍♂️ 9 Primary Squat Progressions

These squat progressions are a great bodyweight leg exercise to start with if you’re new to training or returning from a long layoff. The weighted versions are also suitable for more intermediate movers who have access to weights.

**1. Deep squat**

The deep squat is one of our primary resting positions. Spending time down there will help open up the hips and ankles, and generally provide more freedom of movement when you're low to the ground. You can elevate your heels or use a support if required, gradually moving towards flat feet and an upright torso.

**2. Box Squat**

The box squat is a great way to scale the air squat. Squat down to a sturdy box or chair, gradually reducing the height over time. Begin with your feet at hips-width apart or slightly wider, with the feet forward or slightly out. Maintaining the arch in your feet by screwing them into the floor, you're going to initiate the movement by hinging at the hips (sending the hips back) followed by bending at the knees. Pause for a second as you touch down on the box, then drive back up to an upright position.

**3. Air Squat**

Use the same cues as the box squat, but without using the box or chair as a support.

**4. Goblet Squat (Box)**

If you have access to a kettlebell, dumbbell or a backpack you can fill with heavy items, grasp it in front of you like a goblet and perform a squat. Keep the chest lifted. This front-squat esq position adds the extra challenge of maintaining an upright torso. Use a box to begin with if needed.

**5. Goblet Squat**

Remove the box and perform a full goblet squat.

**6. Partner Weighted Squat**

A partner can be used to apply varying amounts of force onto your shoulders to increase the difficulty of the squat in the upwards or downwards phase of the movement - also known as accommodating resistance. This can range from light pressure on the shoulders, to a full piggyback position.

**7. Back squat**

I thought I’d include a few of the more traditional squat variations as well. For the back squat, you can go low or high bar. Heavy sandbags, a weighted vest and backpack can all work as fairly decent at-home options, although the barbell is ideal. As with the other variations, send the hips back first and screw the feet into the floor throughout.

**8. Front Squat**

The front squat adds the extra challenge of maintaining an upright torso, so requires more thoracic mobility compared to the back squat. It's also a little more quad dominant. Keep the chest lifted, elbows high and torso upright. Again, a barbell is ideal, but double kettlebells or dumbbells can work to a degree.

**9. Overhead Squat**

The overhead squat might be the ultimate test of ankle, hip, thoracic and shoulder mobility. It's a great exercise to experiment with if you have access to a barbell or a couple of kettlebells. Heck, even a broomstick is enough to get started with. Try hard to maintain an upright torso, straight arms and ribs down.

# 🦐 6 Shrimp Squat Progressions

The shrimp squat is a challenging bodyweight leg exercise that builds an excellent foundation of single-leg strength for the pistol squat, as well as more advanced tricks like the dragon squat.

**10. Negative Shin Shrimp Squat**

Begin by focussing on the negative portion (also known as the lowering phase or eccentric). To start, stand on one leg, ensuring the arch of the foot is lifted. Hinge back at the hips with the trailing leg trailing behind, knee bent. Controlling the descent, touch the rear shin to the floor. You can then stand up using assistance (a wall or partner) or via the air squat. If this is too challenging, you can shorten the range of motion using a pillow or block, or use assistance on the lowering phase.

**11. Reduced ROM Shin Shrimp**

Using a step or some blocks, perform a full shin shrimp with reduced range of motion. Allow the shin to gently touch down to the floor/block/step, then drive back up to standing on one leg.

**12. Shin Shrimp**

For the full shin shrimp, you're going freely to lower the shin to the floor with control, and then drive up from the same position using only the standing leg. No blocks or steps.

**13. Full Shrimp**

For the full shrimp, we eliminate the shin touch entirely. So you're going to slowly lower down to the knee on the back foot and drive up from there. Be careful to land as softly as possible with the knee. For an extra challenge, you can keep the heel of the non-standing leg in contact with your glutes.

**14. Increased ROM Shrimp Squat**

Stand on an elevated surface - a step, bench, blocks - and perform the shrimp through an extended range of motion. As a general rule of thumb, increasing ROM makes a movement harder. It’s also a great way to improve mobility.

**15. Weighted Shrimp**

Add weight to your shrimp squat via a weighted vest or backpack. Dumbbells / kettlebells may also work, but be careful with your balance.

# 🦵 5 Pistol Squat Progressions

The pistol requires a high degree of ankle dorsiflexion and hip flexion. It's a great unilateral squat alternative that you can do pretty much anywhere. Some people who find the shrimp squat a bit dodgy on the knees get on much better with the pistol.

**16. Pistol Negative**

The setup for the pistol squat is similar to the shrimp squat, but as opposed to having the non-standing leg trailing behind, it comes straight out in front of the body. Initiate the movement by hinging at the hips and sitting backwards, keeping the quads on the non-standing leg active to help it remain straight out in front of you. Lower with as much control as possible to the floor, then you can either go straight into an air squat to return to standing, or roll onto your back and pop back up into the air squat.

**17. Bottom of pistol hold**

Many people find that getting out of the bottom position of the pistol is the most challenging part. Spending some time down there, alternating sides, can often help build the strength and stability required to overcome pistol plateaus.

**18. Assisted Pistol Squat**

Grab onto a railing, rings or band and use as little support as possible to get through the full pistol squat. You’ll likely need the most support as you rise out of the bottom position, and less in the eccentric phase.

**19. Full Pistol Squat**

Gradually remove the assistance to progress to the full pistol squat, pausing in the bottom position to increase the difficulty.

**20. Weighted Pistol Squat**

A backpack or a weighted vest can be a great way to add load to the pistol squat to increase the difficulty.

# 🤺 5 Lunge Progressions

Lunges are a great way to open up the hip flexors which often become shortened from prolonged sitting, which can have a knock on effect on posture. The cossack squat is also included in this section, an excellent frontal plane movement (and useful for developing the side splits).

**21. Back Lunge**

From a neutral position with an upright torso, you're going to step back with one leg and lower the hips back and down. Keep the core active and the glute on the rear leg engaged (to support the lower back). Gently lower the back knee to the floor or hover it an inch above, before driving back up to the starting position. You can perform a set on each side, or alternate sides for each repetition.

**22. Front Lunge**

For many, the forward lunge presents more of a challenge than stepping backwards as it feels less stable. You're essentially going to perform the same movement pattern, except you’ll step forward into the lunge as opposed to stepping back. It’s a great way to practice deceleration and rebounding - useful in various sporting scenarios.

**23. Cossack Squat**

The cossack squat is a frontal plane exercise, meaning we’re moving from side to side. It's great for strengthening and lengthening the adductors and building the active flexibility needed for the side splits. Keeping the arch lifted, you're going to shift your weight towards one side, straightening the opposite leg and coming up onto that heel. You may struggle to get down to the full bottom position at first - just work at whatever height is comfortable.

**24. Clock lunges**

Clock lunges are a great way to introduce some variation in the planes of movement. You're going to perform 5 lunge variations per side. If we take the right leg first, you’d lunge to the north, north east, east, south east, and south - trying to maintain a stable, upright position throughout.

**25. Weighted lunges**

All variations of these lunge patterns can be progressed by adding weight - either with the weights by your side, up in a front rack or goblet position, or in a backpack.

#  🤸🏻 5 Split Squat Progressions

The split squat is similar in many ways to the lunge. I find the latter is more useful for building speed and power, whereas the split squat is a great strength builder (and excellent for developing the front splits). Each split squat has a different purpose.  

**26. Front Elevated**

Raising the front foot onto a step or box allows you to work more into hip flexion on the front leg (how far you can bring the leg towards the chest) - opening up that front hamstring. Think of the split squat as a static lunge. Instead of returning to neutral, you stay in the split stance. Keep the core and rear glute engaged throughout, and try to keep the rear leg as straight as possible. Lower the hips down and forward.

**27. Rear Raised Split Squat**

Raising the rear foot onto a step or bench allows you to work more into the hip flexors on the rear leg, helping to improve hip extension (the ability to extend the leg behind the pelvis). The vertical shin angle may make it more posterior dominant.

**28. Floor Split Squat**

For the full split squat, we remove the step or bench entirely, performing the movement on the floor. The increased shin angle makes this variation anterior/quad dominant.

**29. Full Raised Split Squat**

Elevating both the front and rear foot increases the range of motion for the split squat considerably, resulting in greater activation of the posterior chain.

**30. Weighted Split Squat**

As with the lunges, you can increase the intensity of each split squat variation by adding weights.

#  ⬆️ 3 Step Up Progressions 

**31. Step up**

The step-up is essentially a deep, one-legged squat variation. Place your front foot on a bench or step, feet hips width apart, and press down through that foot to come up to stand on the bench. Ensure the knee doesn't collapse inwards as you step up. Lower back down to the floor with control. You can alternate sides or perform one set on each side. You can progress this by using a higher step or bench.

**32. Light Foot Step up**

Coming onto the toes or even the top of the back foot means more weight into the front foot, making the step up considerably harder.

**33. Weighted Step up**

Holding dumbbells, wearing a backpack or weighted vest can all add load to the step up.

**34. Deep Step up**

Increasing the height of the bench or step increases range of motion, typical making the step-up more challenging.

# 📷 4 Plyo Squat Progressions 

Power training isn't all cleans and jerks. You can build plenty with your bodyweight or some moderate weight kettlebells. Ideally you would build some base strength with the other squat progressions before experimenting with plyo drills.

**35. Jump Squat / Box Squat**

The jump squat is an excellent exercise for developing lower body power. Begin as you would with an air squat, but bring the arms behind your body. From the bottom position, explode upwards, throwing the arms overhead. Ideally perform these onto a box, then step down to reduce the landing force.

**36. Depth Jump**

Start on a slightly elevated surface - a small step or box. Drop down to the floor, briefly landing in a stable stance, and rebound up into a jump squat. Ideally land that squat on another box, as opposed to back on the floor. We’re using the stretch-shortening cycle to maximize power output.

**37. Broad Jump**

The broad jump is similar to the jump squat, but instead of aiming for height, you're going for distance. It's a great exercise to include in your toolkit for sprint-specific speed/power.

**38. Jump Lunge**

The jump lunge is great for building power in that athletic split-squat stance. Like the jump squat, you're going to explode from the bottom position, reaching the arms up overhead. You can alternate sides or perform one set per side.

# 📷 3 Calf & Foot Exercises

Isolating the calves isn’t something I do a whole lot in my own training, as they get plenty of stimulation from single leg work and barefoot running. But for some, improving calf strength or size may be something that supports their performance or aesthetic goals, so I thought I’d include a couple of variations. 

**39. Calf Raise**

From a neutral stance, raise up onto the balls of your feet, pausing at the top position before lowering with control. The tendency may be for the ankles to collapse in or out - try to remain stable.

**40. Calf Raise**

Stand with the balls of your feet on the edge of a step, increasing the range of motion for the calf raise. This has the added bonus of helping you to improve ankle mobility through dorsiflexion.

**41. Jump Rope**

Jump rope is a great way to strengthen the feet, practice safe landing mechanics, and build general springyness (super technical term). Try to keep the chest lifted, shoulder blades back and down, and glutes on (pelvis tucked under). Be mindful of your feet as you land, trying not to collapse in/out.p Rope

# 🐉 3 Miscellaneous Squat Progressions 

The following are not what I would include as primary progressions for increasing strength or building muscle, but they can be fun to play around with. Note - both the dragon squat and sissy squat require you to move into what could be considered ‘more extreme’ ranges of motion, so please proceed with caution. Full disclaimer - the full versions of both are not currently in my practice, so I suggest looking elsewhere for more in-depth tutorials.

**42. Shrimp to Alternate Side**

A useful early dragon squat progression is to work on the shin or knee shrimp squat, but instead of placing the leg down in line with the hip, you touch down on the other side of the standing leg. You can start to use the arms and upper body as a counterbalance.

**43. Elevated Dragon**

Standing on an elevated surface and letting the non-standing leg drop down towards the floor will allow you to get a little deeper into the dragon squat position. You can progress this by lowering the surface until you're down to the floor. I'm not quite there yet, but I'm sure there are plenty of tutorials here in the sub.

**44. Mini Sissy Squat**

If you have a history of knee injuries, be mindful with this one. From a deep squat, come up onto the balls of the feet and allow the knees to slowly come forward and down to the ground. If you want to take this further, you can progress to standing, lowering down to an elevated surface. Then gradually lower that elevation until you get to the floor (or so I’m told).

"Today, for the first time in history I did 101 pull-ups in 42mins.",None,1628,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hgo9e9/today_for_the_first_time_in_history_i_did_101/,1593237907.0,"So I would say I’m more of a runner than anything, at least I was before I fucked up my knee a month ago, and I would also do simple body weight exercises along with that. Recently I’ve been lifting weights at the gym which was something I rather much enjoyed as a teen. I wasn’t able to go to the gym today and thought “hey I haven’t done pull ups in a while” and well I don’t want to lose the very little body weight conditioning that I have. So I decided I would do 100 pull ups as my exercise for the day. I wasn’t sure how long it’d take but I thought I could do them in under an hour. I ended up doing 101 pull ups in 42 mins while listening to hiphop. Thank you for your time! Lol

5 Minute Morning Mobility Routine,MovementTom,1626,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6mdmkl/5_minute_morning_mobility_routine/,1499682733.0,"**WATCH THE VIDEO: https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo**

Hey BWF people,

I know mobility is often a restriction for a lot of people but is essential for bodyweight training, especially advanced positions. I know this subreddit is hot to push good mobility but squeezing in that + training + life, in general, can be a bit tough, especially if it isn't your main priority.

I've put together a general 5 minute morning mobiliser that can help incorporate a little bit of mobility into your day to day routine. The routine focuses on common range of motion restrictions as well as activation of commonly weak/loose phasic muscles like the glutes.

That being said it is a generic routine and, as we know, we all have different needs so just modify to suit you. However, the routine is a good starting point.

If you don't want to watch the whole video then here is a brief summary:

* Optional: [Spinal Articulations](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo?t=2m34s) - 30s
* **A1**: [Pike To Squat](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo?t=2m52s) - 5r
* **A2**: [Pike Rotations](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo?t=3m20s) - 5r per side
* **A3**: [Figure Four Neck Stretch](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo?t=3m45s) - 30s per side
* **A4**: [Kneeling Back Bend](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo?t=4m53s) - 30s
* **A5**: [Squat Rotations](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo?t=5m32s) - 5r per side

* **A9**: [Mckenzie Push Ups](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo?t=7m23s) - 5r

And that's it. Should take just around 5 minutes and hits roughly everything. Obviously, there are things that have been missed or left out but as far as it goes it provides a good bang for your buck.

Anyway, if you have any questions leave a comment below.

At Home Fitness Transformation / 9 months / 27yo ~165 lbs. (Feb.) - 158 lbs (now),ackeba,1618,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jjdcsb/at_home_fitness_transformation_9_months_27yo_165/,1603843915.0," Hey guys. My name's Aaron and I just wanted to share my fitness journey that's taken place over the last 9 months that we've all been locked in our houses (I'm in LA so I'm still very much inside).

Let me preface this post by saying that I'm very much still early on in my fitness journey. I'd say about 75% of what I do is body weight exercises or started as body weight but now with extra weight. I have tons still to learn and improve upon. I've never been to a gym barring 1 or 2 times going half as a joke in HS, but at the beginning of quarantine I was in a really bad place personally. Super depressed and drinking a ton after moving out to LA and having the first few people I thought were friends f me over and lie about all kinds of stuff (I'm in the music industry and that's a story in and of itself, but for another day). I was just down overall, and my girlfriend at the time kinda gave me an ultimatum of ""you gotta find something that drives you and your passionate about or I can't stick around"". It had nothing to do with my physique, I'm just a person that needs exceptional personal challenges to work towards in able to keep myself happy and sane. She recommended that I look into some 75 day hard challenge.

Essentially 75 days with

\-no alcohol only drinking water and coffee

\-no drugs

\-only eating lean meats, whole grains, and vegetables.

\-Work out twice a day for 45 min each (at least half of that outside)

\-at least 7 hrs of sleep

So I decided I was going to try that out, and started at the very beginning of Feb. At first I wanted to die lmao but after a week or so I started to fall in love with the training and decided that I was going to make myself look like a marvel superhero, and be in my best athletic shape of my life instead of just doing the challenge for challenge' sake.

Here's the progress from day 1 (Feb 1st) till now [https://imgur.com/a/Eu0KFpk](https://imgur.com/a/Eu0KFpk)

I ended up lasting 60 days adhering strictly to the rules of the challenge, but had a drink on the 61st night lol.

As far as my routine -

When I first started I was walking 3 miles a morning 7 days a week gradually incorporating more and more running as I was able to.

Then for my lifting I'd lift every day doing a full body routine I made up. I got a backpack and filled it with my heaviest belongings till it was around 25 lbs and used that as a free weight.

100 standard pushups

50 declined pushups

50 inclined pushups

3 sets of  tricep dips 25 reps each

3 sets of curls 10 reps each arm

100 sit ups

3 sets upright row 20 reps each

2 sets of under arm raises 20 reps each side

That was essentially what I did for the first month till I got bored, and learned more about weightlifting etc.

Since the start of things I've done a ton of research and learned a lot more about weightlifting, rest days, dieting, macros, etc and have applied what seems to work best for me without being too overly critical.

These days I'm still eating super clean. Very little sugar. almost only whole grains, but limited carbs. I try to get 150 - 200 grams of protein a day. I have a few drinks every now and then, and sometimes allow for a cheat day every blue moon, but honestly the hardest thing for me is to intake enough calories every day to stay at a surplus. I have protein shakes sometimes, but other than that I've never done any supplements and wouldn't know where to start.

There have been slip ups here and there throughout the journey. In June my father in PA passed away surprisingly from a heart attack at 56, and that led to a rough few months for my physical and mental health and a lot of time helping with family, but these days I'm dealing with it all as well as I can.

My current routine is significantly more organized than it was. I alternating between doing sprints for 3.5 miles and rucking with 50 lbs for the same distance every other day. My 9 month old Pitsky loves the running days as she joins me every day.

Then for my lifting I split up my week doing

Mon - full upper body

Tues - Chest and Shoulders

Wed - Legs

Thur - Arms and Back

Friday - Rest

Sat - Chest and Arms

Sun - Legs

I try to get in 100 pull ups every other day as well. I try to break each day into 5 or 6 different workouts. doing 3/4 sets of each.

I also brought back a bunch of old donut shaped weights from PA so I can more precisely measure my strength improvements and all that, but still put them in my backpack for rucking, pushups, and most other things haha.

Apologies for making such a long post, but I wanted to try and provide some details as to what I'm doing. I've still got a good ways until I'm proper Superman ripped, but I've learned so much, and am so much happier having done what I have up till now. I'd love to chat with anyone so If you've got any inquiries about more specific elements don't be afraid to drop a comment. More than anything else these 9 months have reinforced my belief that there's no better way to succeed at something than to just start. As long as you aren't afraid to be wrong, and have a desire to learn along the way you'll be straight. If I tried to learn everything I know now before I started I never would have started."

The couch stretch is one of the most effective exercises for addressing anterior pelvic tilt (APT) and improving hip mobility. I put together a guide with 5 variations (plus a follow-along hip mobility routine),HealthRoom,1593,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cu0dr7/the_couch_stretch_is_one_of_the_most_effective/,1566493757.0,"Posted this over at r/flexibility last week and it seemed to help some people, so thought I'd give it a share here if that's okay!

Freedom of movement at the hips and the ability to control the pelvis is pretty important - both for general posture and for sports performance.

A simplified model is that excessive sitting leads us with tight hip flexors and weak core + glutes, which can anteriorly tilt the pelvis. A bit of anterior tilting is fine, but for some, it leads to a cascade of other postural issues and dysfunctions.

**Enter the couch stretch, popularised by Kelly Starrett from Mobility WOD.**

It's one of my favorite drills for opening up the front of the hip, releasing the hip flexors, and strengthening/activating the glutes at the same time. And you can do it whilst watching TV, so it's a win all around.

The problem is, if you're super tight, sometimes even getting into the initial couch stretch position is a bit tricky.

So I put together a short guide with 5 variations of the drill - one that's a little easier to get into for most of us, and then four progressions if you want to take things further.

1. The Low Couch
2. The High Couch
3. High Couch + Twist
4. High Couch + Lean
5. Banded High Couc

**Here's a link to the guide if you want to check it out:**

I also put together a 20 min follow-along hip mobility routine that contains the couch stretch, plus some myofascial release work for the lower back and hip flexors too.

28/F finally getting close to 10 strict pull ups 😊,omnisheep1991,1584,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/crhlqs/28f_finally_getting_close_to_10_strict_pull_ups/,1566016530.0,"I usually don't share my workouts but I'm so happy about this that I need to share my thoughts about it. Maybe to many here this is rather basic but it's really a big deal to me because I was born with a hole in the heart and had an open heart surgery, so I am the last person you would expect to be doing anything remotely athletic. 😅

10th rep was not strict so I don't really want to count it. Here's the video:

https://youtu.be/sfkDrUHWbm4

I started off this pull up journey feeling like I will never achieve even a single pull up. After some months of training I managed to do it in Nov 2017.

Last year around Dec 2018, I could do 7 max and was hoping to get 10 by Jan 2019 so I tried doing Grease the Groove. I don't think I did it right because I ended up with a shoulder tendon injury so I stopped training for 3 months 😢. Apparently my rotators were weak which led to some instability so started strengthening those. 

It was a frustrating journey getting the strength back, but I have to admit I feel much stronger after the injury than before because I think my form is much better! 

The road to my goal might have taken a longer time than I wanted but I'm actually thankful that a minor injury helped me to correct my form before going further.

Announcement: I have decided to leave the mod team.,Captain_Nachos,1573,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/14er4k2/announcement_i_have_decided_to_leave_the_mod_team/,1687304213.0,"I just want to start by saying that this community is really special to me. I first started doing BWF and following this sub in the beginning of 2014. That’s 9.5 years, nearly a literal decade that this has been part of my life. Even thinking about that now as I write this is sort of hard to believe.

From joining the subreddit’s IRC channel back in 2015 (and through the migration to Discord server in 2017), the community at the core of the subreddit has been a more or less constant fixture in my life all the way up to the present day.

Getting to join the mod team in 2018 and spending all of this time on helping the community grow and flourish has been such an incredibly gratifying experience, and I’m especially proud of how the discord community has grown since its inception to be such a progressive and inclusive space that is not only good for fitness discussion but also a wider social space where people can find belonging and community online.

In 2016 I started writing and contributing educational content about BWF (and fitness more broadly) on my blog, and started posting it here. In the beginning, I was writing content that I can retrospectively call ‘well intentioned, often accurate but occasionally ill-informed and not very original’ (as you would expect any 18 year old with a mere 2 years of training experience to do).

Since then I’ve had a real diversity of experiences both professionally and non-professionally within the fitness industry that I have learned so much from, I’ve completed a lot of little certifications like personal training and sports massage therapy, as well as bigger ones like an undergraduate degree in sport and exercise science and I’m currently a little less than 3 months away from becoming a qualified, licensed physiotherapist. (Or physical therapist, if you’re in the USA).

As a mod I wanted to take my knowledge of fitness from all of this, together with my existing experience creating written content online and my love for this community, to develop the eductional resources in the sub’s wiki to improve the experience for new users. I proposed this idea to the rest of the mod team and got to work.

Years of seeing the same complaints in the sub and the discord about the RR, with people stumbling at the same speed bumps every single time, I decided I wanted to try and fix these issues. That’s where my plan for a multi-routine overhaul to the RR came into my head and I started work on it back in 2020. Thus came the Primer routine as the first step of that overhaul at the beginning of 2021. I put a good few hundred hours into the creation and launch of that routine, and I was super happy to see how well received it was. Up til the restriction of the sub I was still getting comments every day from users posting about their journey through the old 2021 build-up routine posts

After that, some personal issues (paired with the nightmare of workload that is an accelerated 2 year master’s programme) put the routine development on hold and I did not get the next step (the BWSF routine) out until the beginning of 2023. Even having released it now, it’s still not absolutely complete. Some progression lists are awaiting videos that I originally planned to film in breaks from my degree, but now will probably be filmed once I’ve graduated and can find the time.

Starting just a couple of months into 2023, myself and the rest of the mod team have been contending with a lot of accusations that I am either some sort of rogue agent, acting against the high minded ideals of the rest of the team behind their backs for monumental personal gain, OR I have corrupted them into collusion with my plot and am paying them off (???) to look the other way as I amass untold riches from the unwitting members of the subreddit.

All of this has been centred around the fact that in both of my routines, there are links to my site. A site that is ad-free, and has no content from either routine behind a paywall, BUT has a paid-access prehab/rehab/mobility exercise library that is entirely unrelated to either routine, hosted also on the same site.

All of the decisions around how my content is presented on the wiki, as well as the fact that there are links to my site, have been continually discussed amongst the mod team and I have never made unilateral decisions or ignored the thoughts and wishes of the other moderators on this topic. I don’t even want to give credence to the ridiculous weirdo conspiracy theories that I’m paying them off, but I am *quite obviously 100% not doing that and have never done that*, for anyone doubting it.

However, the continued pressure we are experiencing from repeated instances of this drama has led to some disagreements in the mod team about how to resolve the issue. Ultimately, I’ve felt there is a difference in values between myself and different members of the mod team (which I absolutely cannot fault them for) and an increasing desire from my end to assert boundaries over my ownership of my work and consequently how I want it to be presented.

This has led to me re-evaluating my desire to have my content in the wiki, and similarly my desire to remain a member of the mod team. I want to be clear that this is not out of spite to the community or my fellow mods, nor martyrdom, but actually the opposite; it’s in the interest of maintaining good relationships with folks I have known for 6-8 years, many of whom I consider close friends. I do not want to have to choose between violating my own boundaries over how my content is presented, or allowing all the vitriol from these random angry internet users to poison those relationships I care about.

This is all happening at a time where the future of Reddit is rapidly more uncertain every day, and I have come to a personal conclusion that I likely do not want to keep using the platform. This has, without a doubt, influenced my decision significantly as well. I do not want reddit as a platform to continue to profit from the content I’ve produced given the degree to which I disagree with their actions as a company (which continue to get worse every passing day since the start of the protest).

So from today, I’ll be removing my content from the wiki, and then stepping down from the sub mod team. I have discussed this internally with all the mods as well to let them know of my decision earlier this week.

I have told the rest of the mod team that if they so chose, they can put it to a vote, based on the merit of the routines alone, whether or not to add direct links to the routines on my site back into the wiki so that they are still accessible for the userbase, but I do not want the content of the routines themselves copied into the wiki as it has been thus far.

Having said all this, I will still likely be active in the discord server, as all the things I said about the community there still ring absolutely true to me, so I’m not stepping away from the community itself. Just reddit and moderation of it.

Take care, all of you.

Depressed but worked out anyway,MyNameIsAlreadyTook,1556,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bhgkap/depressed_but_worked_out_anyway/,1556241946.0,"I've been in a terrible slump mood-wise for the past few weeks.  Have slacked on working out and have not done any in the past 2 weeks.  Have felt overwhelmed, stressed, depressed, and just disconnected and completely unmotivated.  Today was the worst I've felt in a really long time, but about an hour ago I decided to do something anyway.  Felt like I needed to.  Getting through the warm-up of the RR by itself felt like hell...like trudging through sludge that was up to my neck with a thousand pounds on my back.  Have just been feeling so dead.  However, towards the end of the warm-up, the tinyest bit of momentum showed up in my muscles and core (which felt like a very welcome change considering how much stress and tension I usually carry in my stomach area).  I kept going, still didn't feel good or fun like it often does, but I kept going anyway.  Still felt like shit but just the smallest bit less, and the burn and aching in my muscles was again a welcome change from the numbness and lifelessness.  I kept going for another 35 minutes or so and got through most of a shortened version of the RR, and in the last 10 minutes or so, a feeling of relief and exhaustion but also connection with my body finally hit me like a warm wave.  I feel so much better and am so glad that I pushed through even though it felt impossible.

I just wanted to post while feeling this huge shift as a reminder to myself partly.  But also to reach out to anyone else who might be struggling right now.  You are not alone and you can and will feel better.  Please remember to reach out to others for help and to take care of yourself.  And if you see a tiny glimpse of an opening through the fog, just fucking take a dive for it.  The worst that will happen is that you find a bit more of the same shit, but there's also a chance you might be able to find a bit of a clearing to find your footing and remember what it feels like to be the you that you want to be.  

Also, it really is amazing how moving the body can knock some chemicals around in our brains.

Also also, I think it's amazing that I can post this to a bunch of strangers. Hope it helps someone like posts on here have helped me several times before when looking for motivation."
OFFICIAL RR UPDATE: New Year's New Routine(s)! --- (Coming Up in 2 Weeks: a Total Beginner's Community Exercise Event! ) ---,Captain_Nachos,1553,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kfqmhl/official_rr_update_new_years_new_routines_coming/,1608315958.0,"Hey guys! Nick-E here.

It's been quite a while since I've posted here, or since the sub has had much development at all; unfortunately no one on the mod team has quite as much time as we all used to, but a few of us are banding together to try and get the sub revitalised in the new year! This post is the first sign-post of things to come, in that respect.

A big part of that revitalisation will be a gradual overhaul of the wiki/FAQ content, and of the routines. (Including the RR! \*gasp\*)

This is something I've been wanting to do for at least the last whole year but between working and finishing my undergraduate degree, I've not had time until the last couple of months.

In terms of the justification for updating the RR:

There has always been talk on the undercurrents of the sub for many years, voicing various critiques of the RR

>e.g.  
>  
>""There is way too much to read/learn/absorb before I can even start exercising!""  
>  
>""The progression plan does not account for plateaus/failures""  
>  
>""I don't know how long I should run the RR for. When am I 'done'?""  
>  
>""There should not be only one cookie-cutter program that the sub gives a blanket recommendation for everyone to do, regardless of individual skill levels and needs""

Not only that, but over the years of giving advice in our discord server (the absolute heart of the sub where the mods and many longtime community regulars hang out, come check it out: [https://discord.gg/pG3CDZPMHP](https://discord.gg/pG3CDZPMHP)) I've found myself progressively giving more and more advice that is slightly (or very) in contradiction with the RR and I've found myself increasingly dissatisfied with it as the 'holy grail of the subreddit'.

As a result, over the last 3 months or so I've been toying with the concept of a total RR overhaul, and working on it whenever I have had any free time. I believe I've come up with the beginnings of a fairly sophisticated solution to many of the past issues the original RR suffered from.

At the beginning of the month, I proposed my ideas to the rest of the modteam and we collectively discussed it as well as other details relevant to the sub refurbishment.

Here is what was discussed. **(NOTE: if you're new to exercise, you can skip all the nitty gritty details in the below section, and skip right to the one labelled 'New Year's Beginner Event!'.)**

# Recommended Routine Overhaul:

So the central theme of this overhaul is the idea that a single, cookie-cutter routine that is meant to be applicable to every one of our nearly 2 million (!!!) subscribers that can be run for an infinite period of time until death is just not tenable. So with this in mind, the overhaul will involve the creation of 5 separate routines, creating a pipeline from very absolute beginners to exercise all the way through to more advanced trainees whose goals will begin to diverge and specialise.

The routines labelled (WIP) stands for 'work in progress'. This means the routines are still in development. The more advanced routines need many more scrutinising eyes and collaborating hands on them and so will rightfully take a little longer to complete. The aim will be to get all of them done over the first half of the year, ideally (life circumstances allowing) before I start my Master's degree and lose all ability to continue to work on this for the greater part of 2 years, but we are aiming to launch the BWF Primer for the new year, so all the lovely newbies that want to start getting fit in the new year will have something appropriate to get them started.

&#x200B;

|Routine:|Purpose:|Details:|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BWF Primer Routine|To ease people who are totally new to exercise into a routine, letting them learn as they go|Will give you something to do (almost) every day, and allow you to start exercising from day one, splitting the necessary reading/learning across an initial 2 week period.|
|BWF Strength Foundation Routine|The basics of BWF, intended to give you the foundation of strength required to follow any of the 3 following specialisation paths.|Most like the current RR in structure, but with very key changes made. Most notably, a specific end goal.|
|Weighted BWF Routine (WIP)|For people who have completed BWF Foundations Routine and want to continue gaining strength/muscle but don't care about gymnastics tricks, skills and levers|Will be a periodized repeatable block program focused on increasing the weighted versions of basic lifts (dip, pullup, row, pushup)|
|GST Specialisation Routine (WIP)|For people who have complete BWF Foundations and want to start learning tricks, skills and levers like Planche, Front Lever, Handstand, Muscle-up, etc.|This is the least well developed routine so far, but might include some modular programs based on focusing your progression on individual skills (E.g. planche focused routine, front lever focused routine).|
|BWF / Barbell Hybrid Routine (WIP)|For people who want to add some BWF into a gym based barbell routine or for people who have moved through the pipeline and want to put more emphasis on leg strength than BWF allows|Similar to weighted BWF, will be periodized repeatable program, adding progression towards Barbell Squats and Deadlifts, additionally using other gym equipment to augment your BWF training|

&#x200B;

The term 'pipeline' used above is key; the routines will funnel into one another, creating both a natural progression path for the total beginner, and also allowing for inlets for people new to BWF but not new to exercise, at various levels of existing fitness.

Here is an early draft of a flowchart of how that may work out, a slightly prettier, finalized version of this will likely be in the wiki in the future to help newcomers pick between the routines. (in that pic, intro to BWF is the 'BWF Primer'. The name keeps changing!)

# New Year's Beginner Event!

So starting Jan 1st, we will be launching the BWF Primer Routine for absolute beginners to start to kick off their new year's resolutions.

These workouts will follow a set structure for the first 2 weeks, starting very short and easy, and over time will build up to a full workout routine by the end of the 2 weeks. The details of this will be explained in greater detail next week.

Importantly, because of this set structure (this will be explained in detail in next week's post) people will be able to all start on the same day, and follow through it together, using a centralised daily post that will be stickied at the top of the sub to check in and discuss how its going with other people who are doing the same thing! Sweet, sweet accountability!

For example:

Every day there will be a post saying 'New Year's Community Workout: BWF Primer Day X' (or something to that effect, fancy name is pending, and pun suggestions are welcome). In that post, there will be instructions on what exactly to do in your workout on that day, and some informational/educational reading relevant to the workout. People can comment how it went, questions they have about the reading, and just generally discuss in the comments section of that post!

Simply put, if you have been wanting to get started with exercise, this Jan 1 will be the best time to do so with an easy guided routine that you can do in a big community of other new people, for free! If you know anyone who wants to start exercising but doesn't know how, let them know about this event starting in the new year!

New year's is exactly 2 weeks away as of today. I will be posting about this next week to go into more detail about the program as well as to remind people of the event.

# Some Context:

For all the users that don't know me (which is probably most by now), I've been a part of the r/bwf community for about 6 years now. I've been a mod for almost 3 years, where I came on the team initially to take part in the development of the last major RR update, working alongside the other training-savvy mods. I also have a website, ([nick-e.com](https://www.nick-e.com)) from which I used to post articles and tutorials about BWF for the subreddit semi-regularly between 3 and 5 years ago when I was a wee lad not yet having found my footing as a fitness professional. I am currently undergoing a website re-design that will hopefully be coming out before the New Year as well, to provide some content to go along with the new routines.

In terms of my credentials (incase anyone wants to know 'who the heck is this guy and why is he touching our precious RR):

* I am a professional online strength/mobility/rehab coach, and do this stuff for a living
* I have an undergraduate degree in Sport and Exercise Science
* I am a certified Personal Trainer (lol) and Sports Massage Therapist
* I have been training for about 8 years, more than half of that time being BWF specific training
* Many years of learning both independent and from people much wiser than me, across internships in Strength & Conditioning in professional sport, mentorship from others while working in gyms over the years and many workshops and seminars from people like Yuri Marmerstein, Ido Portal, MovNat, Mikael Kristiansen, Kelly Starrett and more!"
Calisthenics changed my life! (15 month of training),ElvisLifts,1552,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jxtlvg/calisthenics_changed_my_life_15_month_of_training/,1605894035.0,"Hi everyone! 

It's Elvis again! It's been a while I think it's more then 3 months or so since my last post so I've decided to update people on what I've been doing this whole time! Most people most likely don't know who I am so I will introduce myself again.

My name is Elvis! I am 26 years old and I from Latvia! At the moment I am working full time job but in the free time I can call myself a calisthenics enthusiast for the past 15 months! 

I have previously shared my progress in Calisthenics as well as my body transformation but this time I've decided to not just focus on reps and strength improvement but actually focus on something that is a lot more important than doing more and more reps and that thing obviously is form! I've created a video where I share how my form in exercises over the past 15 months of Calisthenics training has improved and results are quite shocking to say the least!

I like to thank you for this community for accepting me and responding to my posts/results in such a positive way! It really motivates me to continue working out and improving my results/form/physique I'm glad to be part of such a positive and nice community! That is why I love calisthenics cause it's been the only sport/form of training in which I've was able to accomplish this physique cause I was always the bigger guy with quite high body fat %

My last post focused me going from no muscle-ups to 12 reps which was huge accomplishment for me since I am tall and heavy guy! But I still would like to point out that my form in those reps wasn't the best so rather then going for more and more reps I've decide to switch focus on form and show you guys how much I've improved in that regard!

&#x200B;

Also I know some people will ask why I train legs in gym if I am a calisthenics athlete and the answer is simple it's very difficult to challenge your legs with just bodyweight and I don't get the hate for going to the gym for leg workouts since most guys don't even train legs.

&#x200B;

This post is to motivate people start training if they are having problems finding the inspiration or the right motivation to do so! I know it's difficult I myself had couple of injuries and I was sick twice this year and the weather outside is always not perfect either but it is what it is! You just have to be consistent and persistent and anything is possible!

&#x200B;

**Some information about me and my training from last post (for people who don't know me)**

**Previous training background**: I trained in **power lifting** so basically a lot of focus was on me doing bench press, squats and deadlift for three reps and 3 sets. I liked the workouts but it's also quite dangerous so you have to be careful and always train without the ego! I've had decent results there but I was way too heavy and I felt like my core was weak etc. Calisthenics definitely changed the way I think about training and it seems it's more practical to be able do certain movements with your body weight.

&#x200B;

**Time period: 15 months**

Training type : Calisthenics/Gym (for leg training)

Cardio : Running, Swimming, Cycling, Box, HIIT and some circuit training as well

&#x200B;

**My training schedule:**

Calisthenics: 4 times a week

Cardio: 3 times a week (I usually do cardio after my workout)

Weight lifting (mostly for legs): 2 times a week

Did my first chin up yesterday!,lalalalalily,1528,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lhotdi/did_my_first_chin_up_yesterday/,1613062188.0,"This year has sucked for everyone, and I was no exception to that. On top of everything else going on, last fall, I went through a sudden and unexpected break up that resulted in me having to fly across the country and move in with my parents in half a day's notice.

Because of the pandemic, for months my ex was basically the only person in my life, and my world revolved around him. I was utterly lost at suddenly being without him, and I thought the pain would never go away. I didn't know if I'd ever find another reason to be happy.

Fast forward to the new year. My brother's old pull-up bar is visible in the background of my Zoom calls, and quite a few people have asked me if I could do a pull-up, to which I always sadly replied no. Also, I've been told in the past that I wouldn't be able to do a pull-up because I'm a girl and also too ""bottom-heavy."" But I was sick of feeling sorry for myself, so on Jan 1 I started a pull-up training program.

This past month I've done more upper body/back-focused work than I probably ever have before, and there were many days where I wanted to give up and thought that a pull-up would be impossible for me. So you can imagine my surprise when I was able to do a clean chin-up yesterday! Even though I haven't hit my final goal of doing a pull-up, it's crazy to tangibly see the progress I've made, and I'm feeling pretty unstoppable now 💪

Anyways, I've always enjoyed lurking on this sub and reading about people reaching their goals, so I just wanted to share mine and say that no matter how low you're feeling, there will be a better day out there 💖"

I know its really stupid and its just me lying to myself. So i was thinking of a way to exercise consistently. How effective would it be to do 10 pushups for every death while im gaming. Im really inexperienced about this stuff so i wanted an advice from people who know their stuff. Do you think this will work and is there any better way to do this?

Six years ago, I quit smoking cigarettes, decided to learn how to handstand, and discovered this subreddit. I was underweight, and started to work on my diet. I met u/antranik and all the other great content creators of the time, and learned everything I could. I also left my job and enrolled at a university.

One year later, [I came back to report my progress](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/24kt1f/thank_you_rbodyweightfitness/).

Since then, I've received my Bachelor's degree and am almost finished with my Master's! I've spent most of this time just trying to maintain my health while focusing on academics, so my focus on fitness has been very on and off. Then I started rock climbing 2 years ago, which has become my primary form of exercise -- these days I generally only see u/eshlow over in r/climbharder.

It's been an awesome ride, and I can't thank r/bodyweightfitness enough for being there when it counted. You guys have made a huge difference in my health, my life, and my happiness. I hope everyone just starting out here finds the success that I have found in these exercises and this community.

Routine: First year was only handstands (15 minutes a day) and pull ups (3 sets of X, GTG). I then started doing pushups (3 sets of X), pull up variations (archer, typewriter), handstand pushups, bodyweight squats -> pistol squats. Hanging leg raises and planks (got to 8 minutes static hold).

These days, I go to a bouldering gym 2 hours/day, 3 days/week (mostly indoors right now, but hoping to get outside more soon! Sport climbers / boulderers in Arizona hmu!) I had shoulder surgery on a labrum tear last year, and really just started taking pullups, dips, and pushups seriously again. The only gains I care to make now are the gains that will help me get up the wall."

I got super hyped and decided at the beginning of May 2018 I would do the same thing, but 5 pull ups instead of muscle ups. (I think I was at about 2 or 3 sloppy reps before May)

I hit my 5 reps by the end of May, got suggested some OfficialTHENX videos browsing YouTube and my mind was blown (dislike THENX now). I completely went to body weight exercises by the start of June. I got a bug, like some of you all might have gotten, where training became my obsession.

Overarching Goals - Front Lever (my favorite), One arm Pull/Chin up, +15 Second Handstand, HSPU

I started Calisthenics with a bro split for the first month or two, and moved to Push Pull Legs. I'm thinking about switching to Upper/Lower soon though.

I do a bit of work with weights (Bicep Curls, Cuban Rotations, Forearm Extensor Curls, weighted basics) but always prefer to do body weight when I can. As well, I usually do a night time stretch for 10-20 min once a week working on mobility.

The only program I ever bought was Body by Rings. I did it for a few weeks in November and it was a very solid program! (Super helpful for structuring my own program because I had way too much volume/exercises before)

Shout out to u/FitnessFAQs & u/MovementTom for always having the best quality information I've come across in the calisthenics community. Honestly, go subscribe to them if you haven't already. [FitnessFAQs](https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessFAQs)  [Tom Merrick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0DZhN-8KFLYO6beSaYljg)

Couldn't of gotten to where I'm at so quickly without them!

&#x200B;

**Diet :**

Mostly ate whatever I felt like eating, especially right before starting calisthenics. I tried to eat over 3000 calories a day during Fall/Winter to stay in a surplus and called it a mini bulk, but I was just eating trash food if I'm honest with myself. I've mostly been able to eat whatever and not put on much of any weight (This whole year I've been between 170-180 lbs)

April and May I have been tracking calories with MyFitness Pal and staying below 2500. Lost about 5-7 pounds (176->170). Taught me a lot about what I'm eating in relation to macros and total calories. Also helped with aesthetics and possibly Front Lever.

&#x200B;

**Previous Exercise Experience:**

Played lacrosse in High School but was skinny throughout school.

Bro style weight lifting at the age of 19 for a little less than a year.

A semester of weight lifting for a workout class in college age 21-ish

Weight lifting 2 days a week (when my girlfriend dragged me into the gym) and not consistently, for 6-ish months before starting calisthenics.

Almost never trained legs before calisthenics... (I used to cramp trying to squat one rep of only the bar on my back)

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned:**

Everyone moves at their own pace.

Looking/comparing progress to someone else wont make you progress any faster.

I've learned how important dedication, consistency, and not pushing yourself is to long term gains. I still idiotically test maxes more than I should. I still slip up ever once an a while and re-injury myself. I still have a ton to learn, but I'm slowly getting better at not making mistakes that slow me down over the long run.

&#x200B;

**Going Forward:**

I have my sights set on a OAC/HSPU and of course cleaning up my Front Lever! (I'll probably do a Front lever progress post with all my training footage and data once I'm happy with my form).

I know I'm [not too far](https://gfycat.com/EuphoricVainKiskadee) from the OAC but Shoulder/Pressing strength has been lacking for me relatively speaking (Injured my upper back trying to do too many wall HSPU early 2019).

&#x200B;

No intentions of slowing down though. Keep an eye out for a post like this from me in 2020 as well :)

This sub has changed my life.,loadofoldcodswallop,1517,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mqo63f/this_sub_has_changed_my_life/,1618398014.0,"Thank you, all of you, from the bottom of my heart.

I've re-written this three times now trying to condense it, but I feel I need to cover my journey leading to this sub to give the full impact it has had, and want to start a discussion around why we workout, and how it helps us.

I'm in the best shape of my life, and the other day without realising it, when an old friend asked how I was I said with my head held high, ""I'm really good thanks.""

To try and cut a log story short I've been clinically depressed for 15+ years with zero response to any medication. I was a homeless amphetamine addict at 16, agoraphobic and alchoholic at 18, and a food addict leading to a weight of 286lb by 20. Then my son was born. I got clean, lost eight stone and started exercising. I went from barely 1 knee pushup and not even managing a 10 second dead hang to 20 pushups and 10 pull-ups. Then I had appendicitis, but got back on it after six months. But then my life crumbled when I got hit by a car. I broke three ribs, fractured my shoulder blade and punctured my lung. And fell into painkiller addiction and alcoholism leading to a breakdown in my seven year relationship and ending with me sectioned on a mental health ward.

I moved in with my friend, went cold turkey and started working out again. I started using this sub for a bit but then did stronglifts but got bored and just focused on being clean trying to replace my addiction.

Cut to lockdown one. I'd redeveloped my eating disorder late the previous year to give myself control after losing my best job ever and started drinking again. I weighed 10 stone 6 and was thin and weak. I stopped everything, and rediscovered my pushups/pull-ups and then rediscovered this sub once lockdown started. I got FIT I was amazed and so was my girlfriend. I was doing weighted pull-ups and dips and looking good. But ignoring rest and form I tore my shoulder (I'm agnostic but give me a break, god, please).

But this time? I'm doing it right. I've tweaked the routine so it brings me more pleasure, but I'm focused. I gained up to 12st6lb last year and am now on a steady slow cut, currently at 11st11.5lb and I am starting to see my abs for the first time EVER. I look better than I ever imagined I could, I feel strong and healthy, my son and nephews have even started working out and constantly ask me why/ how I'm so strong. They're convinced I'm either an alien or a robot (jury is still out but I'll take it) and I can honestly tell them I eat clean, sleep well, and exercise and they're copying me. My gf has even joined in and lost 20kg in the last year!

But biggest change of all? I'm happy. I'm truly happy for the first time since I was 9 but maybe ever. And this sub is 100% to thank. I've found an addiction that doesn't hurt me or those around me. My drinking is under control, and I'm almost 6.5 years clean of painkillers. And today I went to the gym with my mate and benched my girlfriend's weight for 8 reps (60kg!) And managed 4 good reps of 70kg. All from using my body and gravity to train. And I can't wait to see where this takes me. I'm building a home bodyweight gym and a bench for chest as I cannot do dips now without fucking my shoulder and I'm so excited to start learning tricks. I'm even looking into going back to school and getting my high school qualifications and maybe even go to uni.

But my question ls, as I started, Why do you workout? And if it has, how has it helped you? Does anyone else substitute antidepressants with exercise, or are you just trying to look good and do cool tricks? 

TL;DR: I was a homeless high school dropout addict, then morbidly obese, then an addict again, then dramatically underweight. And now I'm happy, healthy, and strong, and finally looking forward to the future. Thanks to this sub, and it's community. You've not only saved my life, but I'm actually enjoying being alive."
"Male, 43 yo - my one year transformation. 98kg->75kg",Xevus,1508,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/z7yspt/male_43_yo_my_one_year_transformation_98kg75kg/,1669739610.0,"Long story short. Never properly exercised in my life, started gym a few times over the years, always quitted after 4-5 months. Was 72-74 kg in my early 20s, then junk diet and sedentary lifestyle got me to 120kg at 30. Stopped added sugar and few other things, got down to 95-100 where I was stable for 10+ years. 

  
Last year I had a major personal crisis and decided to finally do something about my body. Signed up for a gym with pool, and just swam for about 3 months. Started doing basic strength training, first without any real programm. Discovered and began ""Start Body Weight"". Few months later swtiched to RR. Well, almost :)   


I really liked RR except for BW squat progression, so switched to barbell squats with 5/3/1 (squats only). Got a shoulder impigiment from swimming, so could only do dips once a week, as they seriously aggravate my shoulder.   At some point  my pull-up progression hit a wall, so I had to cut core triplet due to lack of time. 5/3/1 squats + 5 sets of pull-ups takes me around an hour already, everything else plus stretching makes the whole trainging around 2.5 hours. My gym is too busy in the evenings for doing exercises in pairs. Finally I have horrible pike mobility and history of L3-L5 spinal issues, so I'm terribly scared of deadlifts.   


My results so far  


**Pullups**  
3x5 with 30kg assist -> 5x5,4,4,3,3 with 7.5 kg weight. Also, static arch holds (30 sec) and arch reps (3x10)  
**Pushups**  
3x8 standard -> 3x8 dips ->3x8 pike pushups (feet at knee level)  
**BB** **Squats**  
3x5 30kg ->1x3 80kg  
**Rows**   
3x5 inverted, around 45 degrees -> 3x10 wide grip feet elevated. Also few days ago I managed to do like 3 tuck FL rows with average form.   
**Core**   
Ab wheel on knees, around 90 degrees->standing ab wheel, 120 or so degrees. Also recently started windshield wipers, straight legs, 3x8 last time.  


From skills my only serious achievement is skin the cat, which I've achieved about a month ago. Learning crow pose now, but my balancing is really bad, so the progress is slow.   


When it comes to looks and body fat, I'd love to drop a 2-3 kg more to have more defined abs, but that proved to be really hard. My body found a new stable weight, and going below 75 will require some serious cutting and fasting, and I'm just not ready for this. Especially since I still need to get bigger arms and chest :)

Today I did my first pull up (2!!) for the first time in my life.,maximilious,1511,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i3p90g/today_i_did_my_first_pull_up_2_for_the_first_time/,1596567178.0,"I used to be 300 pounds, saw people doing calisthenics and decided I wanted to try that because it looks super awesome.  It has been 17 months and I changed my lifestyle around to that of a more healthy / fit individual.  I don't go to the gym, I do all my workouts at home with a pair of adjustable dumbbells (which I bought years ago and never used), a set of resistance bands, my own body-weight, door pull up bar, and a pair of push up bars.

I will be honest, I never trained back before.  I always gave the excuses I didn't have the equipment and I couldn't find a good door frame to place mine at.  Turns out my walk in closet is a good, solid frame and since some time during July... I have consistently worked my back by hanging then activating my lats as to try and do a pull up but holding that position for as long as possible (my gosh that was hard), and then doing eccentric pull ups after those hangs.

I did the hanging / activating for about 4 times for 10 seconds each, then did the eccentrics as slow as I possibly could (sometimes 3,4,5 seconds).

Today instead of doing the usual stuff I decided to see how if I could at least get it half way done... turns out I could do 2 pull ups!!!!

I currently weight 195 pounds and I am 6' tall.  Still losing some weight but it felt so good to finally see results.  I do back 2 times a week sometimes 3 depending how sore I am feeling on a 2/2 day split.

I was wondering, now that I know I can do 1\~2 should I add these to my workouts or keep increasing difficulty of what I am currently doing?

The Most Important Concept EVERYONE Doing Calisthenics Should Know: The Mind-Muscle Connection.,BarSeraph,1506,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8gk0qc/the_most_important_concept_everyone_doing/,1525288351.0,"I was having a look through this subreddit's archives and I was surprised to find that there were hardly any posts about **such an important topic**. The Mind-Muscle connection helped me learn every single calisthenics skill I have under my belt (human flag, front lever, muscle ups, etc), and all my friends who have been doing calisthenics for years swear by how useful it is. I will also summarise the key points about the Mind-Muscle Connection here so you can quickly read them. 

**What is the Mind Muscle Connection?**

In scientific terms, it is ""visualizing the target muscle and consciously directing neural drive to the muscle during exercise"" (1). But in practical terms, Arnold Schwarzenegger defines it as being ""inside"" the muscle while you work out. This means that while you are working out, you are **consciously thinking** about the muscles you are working as you work out. Let's use push ups as an example. Rather than just coming up and down like you might normally do, consciously think about your chest stretching and expanding as you come down. As you come up, visualise your chest bulging out and swelling - visualise it as two rock boulders squeezing together and popping out. This visualisation is what is commonly referred to as the Mind-Muscle Connection. 

**How Can the Mind-Muscle Connection Help Me?**

**Gains**: I know this sub is more focused on the practical benefits of calisthenics, but I know that we all also like to see our hard work pay off in the form of gains. Scientific evidence suggests the Mind-Muscle Connection leads to greater muscle activation, so in theory greater muscle activation = more gains. In an interview with Bodybuilding.com Arnold Schwarzenegger stressed how important the Mind-Muscle Connection is, and was convinced that the reason why other bodybuilders looked like ""sh*t"" in comparison to him was because they didn't have their minds ""inside"" their muscles whilst they worked out. 

**Injury Prevention**: Developing a strong Mind-Muscle Connection will allow you to know when a move ""doesn't feel right"" or if a position feels ""dangerously strenuous"". This is because over the weeks/months/years it takes you to build the Mind-Muscle Connection, you will know what your body responds well to and what it doesn't respond well to. So if a position ""doesn't feel right"", you will know when to stop because you have that strong connection with your body, and thus prevent injury.

**Quicker Progress**: This is the best benefit of developing the Mind-Muscle Connection. When you build a strong connection with your body, you will know what your strengths and weaknesses are. For example if you're doing pull ups and notice you're swinging too much, you will quickly be able to identify that it is because your abs aren't engaged enough/strong enough to stop you from swinging around. If you had not developed the Mind Muscle Connection then perhaps you wouldn't have immediately known why you were swinging. Maybe it would have taken you a few weeks to work that out. But with the Mind Muscle Connection, you will instantly know that you have to go away and strengthen your abs in order to progress with your pull ups. Also because the Mind-Muscle Connection helps prevent injuries, you'll have less injuries stopping your progress so you can progress faster!

Does anyone else use the mind muscle connection? I can't stress enough how much this has helped me (e.g. when I was practising for the human flag I realised I couldn't hold it because I never trained my side-core/obliques - or when I was training front lever I realised that I could hold it longer if I visualised a steel beam running through my body). If you use the Mind-Muscle Connection yourself then I would love to know how you use it and how it helps you!

First 90 degree pushup after 3 years of body weight training!,None,1503,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5w8mcj/first_90_degree_pushup_after_3_years_of_body/,1488085959.0,"Tips I have: 

You will feel like you are going nowhere; however, just whatever you do, keep training.  Eventually you will figure out what kind of routine/program works the best for you.  As you go you will also get better at the more technical things (skill in a handstand) to eventually help you achieve more advanced skills like the 90 deg pushup.  This stuff does not come quickly!  So just keep on keeping on.

90 degree PU: https://youtu.be/on6d901iw-w

My height is 5 foot 5 inches and I weigh in between 138 to 142 lbs.  I am 19 years old!

This sub needs a *REAL* beginner routine instead of the RR,HopeIsGold,1500,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/154hy71/this_sub_needs_a_real_beginner_routine_instead_of/,1689831002.0,"Let me start out by saying the most controversial thing first: *The Recommended Routine is not a beginner routine in 2023.*

&#x200B;

The BWF Primer was a routine built for beginners but the routine is no longer in the official wiki, although a link to Nick's site still exist in the routine dropdown. It worked for many including me as a starting point. But, now, that it is gone, I believe that this sub should create a new beginner routine. **A REAL BEGINNER ROUTINE.**

*Why I think RR is not a correct beginner routine even with the easiest progressions?*

1. In 2023 the teenagers and middle aged population is majorly overweight, and with no to minimal hints of past athleticism.
2. By 2023, the RR is still a good routine for intermediates and those who are athletic with layers of fat due to sedentary few years. Not for  people who sat at a desk their entire teenage years/childhood.
3. It is freaking long for a beginner. If this subs really wants people to get fit and healthy, we should lower the barrier to entry much much further by keeping our expert egos aside.

Don't let beginners start with the impression that working out is a steep hill to climb. It really is not. We should get rid of the attitude as experts or intermediates - ""you are f\*\*king lazy if you can't maintain a habit of grinding"". I mean, that's why they are beginners. They don't have the habit. They have come to you to build that habit. Help them in that prospect. Don't bully or frighten them off.

&#x200B;

With my limited experience working out for the past 3 years, a beginner routine is should be exactly what Kboges preaches. Forget about building aesthetic muscles as the primary goal. The primary goal should be perfecting form for a few full body movements. Precisely 3 movements.

***One push, One pull and One lower body.***

Pick one set of each for how many reps you can do at whichever progression and keep doing it daily for one set. Do this for one month. Then keep increasing 2 to 4 reps until you reach a certain number of decided reps for one set of each movement. Then you add a second set. And a third. Like that.

This makes the hill climb much less steeper. Increases stamina which most beginners lack. That's why the RR feels super long to them specially. It also reduces risk of injury. Most starting to work out don't have to goal of performing skills or hard movements. They just want to get better from where they are at the moment. As an additon they will also build visible muscles and get strong. And working out daily will build the correct habit. And hardly needs 15 minutes of your daily schedule. Once 15 minutes a day becomes a habit, the person will think less about investing another 15 minutes.

&#x200B;

Others, weigh in with your opinions.

&#x200B;

**Edit**: Also the videos for beginners should be excrutiatingly detailed with how to maintain a proper bodyline and all.

&#x200B;

**Edit 2**: Also the explanations/videos of each exercise should say something about the allowable range of good form without getting injured. Sometimes this sub tutorials propagate that there is a single acceptable good form for an exercise and that is the perfect form. Nothing else is acceptable. In reality this is not true. Good form is a range."
Ultimate Guide to Flexibility/Everything I Know,friendswithseneca,1496,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/889gyn/ultimate_guide_to_flexibilityeverything_i_know/,1522406919.0,"Total Body Mobility/Flexibility whatever it’s called these days..

PS: First time poster so formatting may be crappy

This is pretty much everything I know about flexibility, including all the exercises I think one might ever need to achieve complete function and health of their joints, tendons, and ligaments grouped by body part. I've also included brief justifications for most exercises in here, along with the way I program flexibility into my training.
I'm putting this out there because it's a collection of training styles from some of the best people in the business, and it's finally working well for me. I hope it works well for others.
Feedback, ideas, anything of the sort is appreciated!

To see programming suggestions jump to the bottom. I’ve put suggested sets and reps up with each exercise/group of exercises because in general I feel sets/reps are exercise specific and not session specific when it comes to flexibility. 

Also I generally wouldn’t split up exercises in the same group E.g. I wouldn’t do wrist pushups one day and finger pushups the next, there’s no reason you can’t but I think it’s easier to program if you keep joints/muscle groups together

There are exceptions such as exercises that create stability in the joint but are more like strength exercises than mobility exercises such as the Nordic/natural hamstring curl. For these exercises I’ve noted they should be included in your strength training and not considered as mobility (unless you are exceptionally strong)

Also you may think that what I present below is an absolute overkill of exercises, and you may be right. But I don’t recommend doing all of them every day, and I really feel this is a good way to cover all your bases from tendon conditioning, to achieving passive flexibility so you can kick someone’s head off (don’t do that though)

**Wrists**
For all of these exercises start on your knees, or even with your knees underneath your hips and gradually move towards a full push up position

* [Wrist pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIeL0AYygiY) 
* [1st knuckle pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJMmLG6mAIY)
* [Fingertip pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jjBPj7Y4FU)
* [Wrist Shifts and Rotations all directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwQ5E0DeaoQ)
1-2 sets low intensity (10-20 reps) of each 

**Elbow and Shoulders**

* [Yuri Marmestein Shoulder Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdwEWchSjrI) – 1 set
* [High rep curls and pushdowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IQouZQqEvM) 1 set 50-100 reps (include at the end or beginning of strength sessions and use bands)
* [High rep lateral, front, rear delt raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmt7uSU3mmU) 1 set 50-100 reps, the demo of what i'm referring to is about 7 mins into the video, however the entire video is quite good and actually presents the information from which Ido portal developed his hanging for healthy shoulders regime (from [John Kirsch's Book](https://www.amazon.com.au/Shoulder-Solution-Prevention-Revised-Expanded/dp/1589096428))(include at the end or beginning of strength sessions)
* [Standing, seated, prone bar dislocates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lNZRhFJIfc) 5-10 reps aiming for hands placed at shoulder width (add light weight once you achieve shoulder width), can also hold for 10s in the stretched position of your last rep
* Hanging – [scap pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIkPI-_80r4) (10 reps minimum – can move in all directions with the pulls and really bang out as many reps as you feel comfortable), [active hang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoE-C85ZlCE), and [passive hang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIVg_KK_Uzs) 30-60s holds, or if you are strong minutes at a time

Generally include hanging after strength sessions to avoid fatiguing grip, but feel free to include scap pulls as an excellent warm up/scapula activator before strength sessions

* [Scap pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW4p578uRHY) or [serratus wall slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyfb9x7VJWE) are also invaluable exercises 1-2 sets 10-20 reps
* [Bent arm hangs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TLuJ7XeMgI) (chin above bar) are excellent for engaging the scapula correctly at the top of a pull up (shoulders retracted, depressed), and conditioning the elbows (try supinated, pronated, and [elbows bent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVGE861SQog) at 90 degree hangs) 10-30s 1-3 sets

**Knees**

* [Twisting Squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCuaxZZiomk) 10 reps (can add light weight once you reach 10) 1-2 sets
* [Skier Squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvexEC9WwCI) 10 reps each side 1-2 sets
* [Nordic Curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq8y-FAzATc) (part of strength session)
* [Natural knee extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0R1OoKV85M) (wouldn’t use this as strength but good to build mobility, use caution and back off if the knees feel sore) 5 – 10 reps 1-2 sets

Proper training for splits involving stretching of the quads/hips/glutes/adductors will also prevent knee pain due to muscular imbalance (covered further down) 

**Bridge Work**

* [Thoracic Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28QRKpX2jyE) holds (elevate your feet as much as you need if you cannot maintain a straight lumbar spine/lower back, flex your glutes to aid in protecting your lower back) aim for 1-3 sets of 30-60s
* Alternatively if you cannot get anywhere near a bridge, hold [back bend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0HfgL6r3zg) progressions 
* [Rotations into arch using the wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4j7AKd_RjQ) 1-2 sets of 10 reps
* [Rotations into low bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbnmcALXXUY&t=15s) 1-2 sets of 10 reps
* [Low bridge slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbnmcALXXUY&t=15s) 1-2 sets of 10 reps

Take it easy on the above 3 if you cannot get into a bridge fairly comfortably (at least have straight arms with a horizontal lower back and fully flexed glutes, you can start these without your arms being directly under your shoulders however) 

* After achieving bridge work on [rotations into high bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ6mSnBWk-g), and [rotations into low bridge advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxfRZVdb_Fw) 1-2 sets of 10 reps
Most of you will be working on the thoracic bridge for a long time before even touching the rotational stuff

**General Spine**

* [Kit laughlin’s Daily 5](http://gallery.mailchimp.com/4d79ab6c551903a4c00d4ba5b/files/The_Daily_5.pdf) – Absolutely love this man 
* [Jefferson Curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYS0R4c3qCA) – don’t bring any ego to this exercise, start light, and stay light until you are totally comfortable with the weight, increase weight extremely gradually (10 reps, 2s pause at the bottom of each) 1-3 sets
* Some form of [shoulder stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo66EYcbDQM) and/or [decompression through spinal flexion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypKMTJ7mxAI) 1-2 sets up to 2 minutes on a hold
* Extra rotation can be included if you really need it although I believe that anti-rotation/controlled rotation core exercises are the best way to develop this 
* An example of a controlled rotation exercise might be locking your legs into a GHR with your torso horizontal, hands behind your head, and [twisting through your upper back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQA2YjzrrCk)
* Or the [Gymnastic Bodies seated Russian twist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deCLqQ_9S7U) (different from the standard gym rat Russian twist – back is flat, chest up, and arms extend straight out from the chest – the people in this video actually don’t have the best form as their chests could be more upright with arms slightly higher up) 

**Splits/Lower Body Training**

* I recommend using a combination of ballistics, isometrics or PNF stretching, and a weighted/passive stretching session
* I prefer to alternate my lower body flexibility sessions by the type of stretching session
* So one day I’ll focus on ballistics, the next day I’ll utilize isometrics and PNF, and the day after i'll utilize passive/weighted stretching, and continuously rotate this
* Why do I do this? I found it too difficult to include all types of stretching in the one session for all the major lower body stretches in reasonable time

I want to clarify that there are some obvious prerequisites for doing ballistics and weighted stretching. Firstly, you need to be able to get in a position in which they can be effectively and safely applied.
Let's say for example you want to work on your pike: If you cannot sit up straight with your legs locked due to tightness in your hamstrings, then keep working on isometrics and statics until you can at least lock your legs out.
Essentially if you are so inflexible that moving slightly into an extended range feels tight, sore, really difficult, then you simply need more consistency trying to get into that range using statics, and isometrics.

The reason why I would caution against ballistics and weighted stretches for someone that tight is your muscles and nervous system have never been primed for anything like that. You simply have a higher chance of getting injured if you try and force yourself (either through bounces, or adding weight) into an extended range. Once you have been stretching consistently for a short time (2-3 months), you will have gained a much better understanding of what it feels like in the muscle, and probably also gained enough range to get into simple positions.

* For ballistics I aim for 100 reps, more or less depending on how I FEEL (more on the importance of feel later)

* For isometrics/PNF I utilize contractions against the range of motion, and contractions trying to increase my range of motion
* The best way I can describe this is with a single leg pike stretch/front foot elevated pike stretch
* E.g. I have one foot elevated, I’ll switch between isometrics of pulling my heel down (contracting my hamstrings and glutes against the range of motion), and trying to lift my foot off the platform (contracting my quads and hips to try and pull my leg up into a greater range of motion)
For this type of contraction I recommend 10-20s efforts for each contraction, and 3-5 cycles of effort per set for 1-2 sets 

* For passive/weighted stretching I generally prefer to utilise weighted eccentrics/lowering into the range of motion with added weight such as a good morning (whether it's a pike good morning, single leg good morning, pancake good morning etc.)
* There are many invaluable weighted stretches such as a weighted horse stance, jefferson curl, weighted hangs, weighted taylor pose
* I'd rather not present you with a full list of weighted stretches, but show you how I program them in
* The best way to find these exercises and learn of them safely is to search through the websites/youtube channels of reputable people such as Emmet Louis, Kit Laughlin, GB, Jordan Garcia, Tom Merrick, Antranik....Youtube and some quality discernment is your best friend

I’ve grouped the lower body exercises into splits type and a general hips group, and within each group presented the variation(s) I utilize for each of my ballistic, isometric, and passive/weighted days

**Front Splits**

Ballistic and isometric days

* [single leg pike/front foot elevated pike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grhufztdqg8) followed by [vertical shin quad/hip stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsrGdQElYR8) (for ballistics: pulse by contracting the glutes and gently moving forward)

Passive/Weighted day

* [Single leg good mornings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWarD49CFmw) 1-2 sets (10 reps per leg, can be weighted once you achieve perfect form) followed by front split attempts 1-2 sets of 2 minutes

**Side splits**

Ballistic and isometric days 

* [Taylor Pose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha3BgV5K1eQ) – keep hips anterior/back vertical (sit up against a wall if you need to, or sit on a pillow/block) (1-2 sets)

Ballistic Day

* (After taylor pose) [Head to floor pulses in side-split position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Kqmc2B-P8) I would be pulsing in the bottom position rather than coming all the way back up as he is in the video  (1-2 sets)

Isometric day 

* (After taylor pose) Side/Middle split contractions (bringing feet in, and trying to push them out) 

Passive/Weighted Day

* Taylor pose with weight on knees 1-2 sets of 2 min, followed by [horse stance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvOPOuhtczg) 1-2 sets of 2 min

**Hips** (I don’t utilize ballistics for the hips, and I pretty much include these two exercises in every session) 
Also the hips get a good workout from front and side split work, the things I’ve included below mainly focus on the hip rotators

* [90-90 stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pwd7SY83Jg) I always do 2 min hold, followed by 3 x 10s contractions of pushing the front leg down followed by 3x10s of holding the front leg up off the ground
* [Swivel Hips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p0cx3ZRjBA) (for those that have done GB, the swivel hips return!), 10 reps each side, hold and try to pull your legs down actively in the bottom for 2s each rep, keep your butt on the ground
* Some form of end range glute strengthening is very effective to open up your hip flexors, and gain range into hip extension. [Here's an example of what I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w2DJsw3gQ), however make sure to keep a posterior pelvic tilt/activate your glutes, and maybe lift your leg up and over a yoga block next to your knee to keep yourself honest.

Note: Kits daily 5 also targets the piriformis so it’s not included here

**Feet and Ankles**

Do not neglect your feet and ankles, train them as you would your wrists 

* Ido’s ankle routine – 10 reps of, followed by 10 steps forward and back in each position of: eversion, inversion, dorsiflexion, ankle extension (calf raise) 1 set
* Seiza positions: Sitting on your heels with [feet flat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDRnCvp2Xa8), and [toes curled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaDuW9tj_94) 1 set of each 30-60s 
* Standing on one leg, eyes closed (work up to 60s each leg)
* Include calf raises in your strength workouts, preferably single leg. Alternate between standard single leg calf raises for 3-5 sets of 10-20 reps, and [Kit’s correct flat feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfAJa0yNliM) calf raises (3 sets of 5 I believe? It’s in the video) 
* Include dorsiflexion movements in your strength sessions as well to avoid shin splints, focus on high reps and just go until you feel a good burn (probably 20-50 reps) 

In general practice as much as you can barefooted, and learn to run/walk properly without heel striking so much, especially walking
Check out the [fox walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O1weF5_sEA) and maybe grab a pair of feiyues or minimalist shoes to allow your feet to get working instead of wearing cushioned shoes (unless you have a serious medical reason not to) 

I recommend feiyues because most other minimalist shoes are too expensive for what they are, when I first started wearing feiyues as an everyday shoe, the stabilizers around my foot, calf, and ankle were sore for about a week (get the chinese version, not the french version) 

**Overall Programming:**
If you’re still reading after all that then good stuff, have a cookie. 
Obviously you cannot do all of that every single day, nor should you need to.

Quite simply I mobilise/stretch every single day for about 30 minutes, and the intensity of that is dependent on how my body feels.

I want to say most importantly with gaining flexibility you need to listen to your body during the exercise, don’t push through extreme tightness. Pushing too hard when you are tight is going to increase your chance of injury.

Low intensity with more consistency is better than spurts of high intensity that can’t be maintained due to soreness/injury

Check out a [recent discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSPuTWbEdkU&t=1674s) between Emmet lewis and Kit Laughlin on injury and stretching

For programming, I like to include a series of exercises every single session that work on my weak points, but I think generally the majority of people have the same weak points (excluding the super advanced). Also I do a full body routine every single day, but you could split it into upper/lower, or do the full body routine every other day (on your off day perhaps). If I were doing this on an off day/every other day I would probably do 2 sets of each exercise. 
As mentioned above, for my front and side splits work I rotate between ballistics, isometrics, and weighted stretching each session. 

Additionally I don't go through this entire routine prior to a strength session, usually I'll do a small warm up before strength training, and do this routine separately. E.g. Strength in the morning, this in the evening or vice versa.

You could do the more dynamic movements as part of a warm up, and leave the statics/intense stretches for post workout. For potential warm up/pre workout exercises in the routine below I've marked them with a $. Anything that isn't marked with a $, I would leave until after your strength training if you plan on doing strength + flexibility all in the one session.  

**So here’s what I include almost every single session, every single day** (maybe only every second session for * parts).

* Wrist Exercises* 1 set each, 10 reps each $
* Yuri Band routine $
* Shoulder Dislocates (alternate between seated, standing, prone each day depending on how I feel) 1 set 10 reps 2s pause at bottom, 10s pause final rep $
* Scap Pushups* 1 set 10-20 reps $
* Twisting Squat 1 set 10 reps $
* Skier Squat 1 set 10 reps each side $
* Thoracic Bridge/Back Bend 1-2 sets, 30-60s
* Rotations into bridge (pick a suitable progression) 1 set 10 reps $

Should only take you 10 minutes max to get to this point

* Kit’s Daily 5 
* Jefferson Curl 1 set 10 reps 2s pause at bottom $
* 2 Front Split exercises (depends if it’s a ballistic, isometric, or weighted day for me) Minimum 2 sets of each
* 2 side split exercises (again depends on type of day) Minimum 2 sets of each
* 90-90 stretch 1 set as described above (this is my main weakpoint)
* Swivel hips 1 set 10 reps each side 2s pause at bottom (weakpoint) $
* Ido’s ankle routine (described above) $
* Flat foot seiza 1 set 30-60s
* Toe curled seiza 1 set 30-60s
* Standing on one leg eyes closed 1 set each leg 30-60s $
* [Neck stretches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxar8p0WcIM) front, back, and side (no neck rolls) 15s each position
* Something I forgot to include earlier is a levator scapulae stretch, I feel this is a big limiter for being able to effectively depress your shoulders. The way I target this is by putting one arm overhead (right arm up to stretch your right side), whilst making sure to keep that shoulder pulled down/retracted. Then simply tilt your head to the opposite shoulder (so for right side, tilt head to left), you can also go chin to shoulder. A good 30s each side is sufficient

I do not rest at all between exercises, other than changing positions
If you rest, this may take a little longer, but all in all this is the most bang for your buck daily mobilizing/flexibility routine I can come up with. 

**Exercises that should be included in Strength sessions:**

* Natural hamstring curls: For bullet proof hamstrings, place them in your leg sessions as a posterior chain movement (3-5 sets of 5-8 reps is a nice place to start)
* High rep low intensity curls and pushdowns for bicep/tricep tendon conditioning - place these either as warm up to strength sessions, or as a cool down on strength days. I recommend doing these at least once a week, preferably twice. 
* High rep low intensity lateral-overhead raises, front raises, and rear delt raises to condition connective tissue around the shoulder. Same as above.
* Single leg calf raises and Kit’s corrective calf raise (for ankle and foot health). Do the single legs 1-2x per week, and Kit's calf raise once a week (these are very easy to superset in with other exercises so there is really no excuse not to train your calves/ankles)
* Some kind of [anti-extension](https://www.t-nation.com/training/tip-hit-the-abs-with-anti-extension-exercises) and [anti-rotation/controlled rotation](https://yurielkaim.com/anti-rotation-exercises/) core exercises (look these up please)

I think this routine will take most people to significant levels of flexibility, and strength in unorthodox positions. 

Hopefully you understand the general principle, this routine moves through all major joints, and takes each joint through a full range of motion without being lazy (you have to be active in nearly all of these exercises which reduces your risk of injury), and builds the kind of flexibility that can be called on at any time. 

The main thing about flexibility is consistency and knowing where you're at on a daily basis. Eventually you will know what areas need more work than others, and the routine i've offered could serve as a good diagnostic of where you may be particularly inflexible.

I’ve gathered this information from reading articles and watching videos by Emmet Louis, Kit Laughlin, Ido Portal, and Christopher Sommer among others. I hope this compilation serves you well. 

Finally, I just want to say that this is a very good approach for total body flexibility goals, but if you have more specific goals such as purely front split, or purely bridge etc. Then there are more efficient ways of achieving those positions than doing total body flexibility. 
I'm going to say briefly that I would still do total body mobilising every other day, and on other days I would add specific exercises to work towards whatever specific goal I have. 
So if your goal was to achieve a proper bridge for example, this is what I would do... Monday: This Tuesday: Bridge Wednesday: This Thursday: Bridge etc.

Recommended Routine - Resistance Bands Version,FightingLikeBeavers,1488,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/foq8ux/recommended_routine_resistance_bands_version/,1585142806.0,"*Update 10/03/21: I just revisited this and created a new post,* [""The 'super-effective supersets' routine""](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/m23zsk/the_supereffective_supersets_routine/)*. Please read through this post first before checking it out! I also shared some resources that I found helpful for developing intermediate routines* [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/m23kza/resources_for_developing_an_intermediate/)*.*

&#x200B;

Hi all, I have developed a variation of the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) that uses resistance bands, which I believe has some advantages over the original programme:

* Minimal equipment cost, since it only requires a set of bands rather than rings, weights etc.
* Great for travel/outdoor workouts. You can do this ANYWHERE (yes, even during a quarantine!).
* Easier to learn and progress to intermediate+ levels. You will be keeping the same movements throughout and increasing resistance to make this workout harder, instead of introducing new exercises.
* Bands even have some advantages over free weights [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf9QQBc_7e4). See [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/MuscleAndFitnessMag/search?query=james+grage) for some videos that show the difference between free weights and bands for certain exercises.
* I have found that sometimes the limiting factor for bodyweight exercises isn't the muscles, e.g. it might be grip strength for pull-ups or balance for shrimp squats.

&#x200B;

# General notes:

* I still class myself as a *beginner*, so my main motivation for posting this is to educate myself. I'd love to hear feedback/constructive criticism if you have any!
* Ideally try to get a set of loop-style resistance bands that comes with a door anchor (or purchase one separately) if you plan to work out at home. You can do this workout without one, but the anchor will give you more options. Look for something like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TOMSHOO-Resistance-Powerlifting-Exercise-Stretch/dp/B079KYDVXM/); these bands will typically marketed towards people who want help with pull-ups. For what it's worth, I don't actually have a door anchor and purchased a cheap set of resistance bands from Amazon. Check out the comments for some ideas on how to make your own door anchor!
* Fix your sleep and nutrition NOW if you haven't done so already.
   * For sleep, read ['Why We Sleep'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams-ebook/dp/B06Y649387/) by Matthew Walker. Aim for 8-9 hours per night.
   * For nutrition, follow the advice [here](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/). ['Food: WTF Should I Eat?'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-no-nonsense-achieving-optimal-lifelong-ebook/dp/B07649ZQSF/) by Mark Hyman and  [https://chriskresser.com/](https://chriskresser.com/) are good resources for learning about food quality.
* Do this 3x per week. Follow the same rest times as the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_core_triplet), unless noted otherwise. The idea is to work up to the higher end of the rep ranges (maybe you can only do 4 or 5 at the start), then when you can hit that many reps comfortably increase resistance on your next workout. If you are more experienced you can adjust the rep structure to suit your needs. If you start plateauing add an extra set, or [develop your own intermediate routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/training_guide#wiki_developing_an_intermediate_routine).
* James Grage's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JamesGrage/videos) is great for learning about resistance band workouts. He also has a [website](https://undersunfitness.com/) where he sells bands and workout programmes. Good technique is crucial; you want to make sure there is tension in the band throughout the full range of motion. You should never sacrifice proper form just so you can lift slightly heavier.
* Full-finger gloves are highly recommended to help you grip the bands properly and prevent damage to your hands.
* To store bands, hang them up so they are slack, away from direct sunlight. See [here](https://cultureofsafety.thesilverlining.com/fitness/resistance-band-safety/) for some tips on looking after them.
* To make exercises harder, use stronger band(s), adjust the anchor point of the bands (e.g. wider foot stance), or change your grip position to increase tension in the band. Remember to keep the movements the same and just increase resistance when needed.
* One of the downsides of this routine is that it's quite long. If you find that you are starting to burn out before the end of the workout, consider swapping the order of the pairings each time. Otherwise you might end up really good at squats/lat pulldowns compared to the other exercises! You could also change the pairings to move the overhead press after lat pulldowns and pair deadlifts with squats, which makes it easier to prioritise either the upper or lower body at the start of the workout.
* When using a door anchor, you want to ensure you are pulling the door **closed**, i.e. into the door frame. The last thing you want is for the door to fly open mid-workout and cause an injury!
* **Men and women can follow this routine, but there are a few modifications women would benefit from. These are listed at the end of the post.**

# Daily

* Do  10-15 [face pulls](https://youtu.be/OhOe6yA_zYk?t=235) (preferred) and/or [pull aparts](https://youtu.be/OhOe6yA_zYk?t=44) every day. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE! Your shoulder and upper back health will improve significantly, as well as your posture.

# Warm-up: Dynamic Stretches (5-10min)

Follow the warm-up in the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_warm-up.3A_dynamic_stretches_.285-10min.29).  If you can't find somewhere to do arch hangs or support holds, replace them with something like the Vinyasa Flow sequence shown [here](https://yurielkaim.com/dynamic-warm-up-exercises/). I'd always try and do the shoulder band warm-up and wrist prep, but feel free to experiment with other dynamic stretches to the ones listed in the recommended routine (e.g. lunge twists, lateral lunges etc). Lunges in general are great as a warm up exercise!

***Note: After following the routine for a while I have decided to update the rep ranges slightly based on what I have found to work well. The original routine used a 3x5-8 structure for all exercises; you can stick with that if you like, since it will build strength effectively. Ultimately you can build muscle at any rep range as long as you work close to failure.***

# First Pair

* 3x8-15 [Banded Lat Pull-Downs](https://youtu.be/bLZQ7tBJYQ4?t=149). Alternatively, follow the [pull-up progression](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pullup) from the recommended routine (3x5-10).
* 3x5-12 [Banded Overhead Squats](https://youtu.be/rjC1VBuqs8s?t=47)

**Notes:**

* I am recommending lat pull-downs instead of pull-ups for several reasons:
   * It's easier to find somewhere to anchor a band than somewhere to do pull-ups.
   * Most beginners will either be under or overweight. Either way, it's likely that pull-ups will be difficult to start with, since you will be under-muscled and/or find it difficult to lift your own bodyweight.
   * I have found that grip/forearm strength is often the limiting factor for me when hanging from a bar. It might be worth adding some additional [grip training](https://www.reddit.com/r/GripTraining/) to help with this, e.g. if you do have a doorway pull-up bar you can make a point of doing active hangs at various points throughout the day.
* That said, if you have somewhere to do pull-ups and can manage enough reps, it might be preferable to use them instead. Chin-ups will work the biceps more, so use those if you want to get a boost on your arm size.
* Start with bodyweight squats and add a band when you need to increase resistance.
* Consider increasing the reps on the squats if you find you are plateauing (only applies to experienced lifters used to training with heavy barbells). Check out [this](https://youtu.be/rjC1VBuqs8s?t=137) video by James Grage for ideas. You could also try a heavier band and do [front squats](https://youtu.be/4pknEoBxnzs?t=806), or the [pistol squat progressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/squat) from the original recommended routine (with a band if you have really strong quads!). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTiQeKA8jlM&t=847s) video has a few options for training legs with resistance bands.

&#x200B;

# Second Pair

* 3x5-10 [Banded Overhead Press](https://youtu.be/4pknEoBxnzs?t=563). Alternatively, follow the [dip progression](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/dip) from the recommended routine.
* 3x5-12 [Banded Romanian Deadlifts](https://youtu.be/NaKsZos0bIY) or [Banded Deadlifts](https://youtu.be/rjC1VBuqs8s?t=150).

**Notes:**

* I am recommending overhead presses instead of dips, since it can be hard to find somewhere to do the dip progression with correct form (e.g. kitchen counter only works if you are thin enough, etc). I also think a shoulder exercise is better for most people than a lower chest exercise. That said, if you have[somewhere to do dips](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/dip#wiki_what_if_i_don.27t_have_parallel_bars.3F) you could rotate between those and the overhead press if you want to get more chest development.
* Start with bodyweight Romanian deadlifts and add a band when you need to increase resistance.
* I follow the advice in the recommended routine of doing Romanian deadlifts 2x per week and regular deadlifts 1x per week.
* You can vary the Romanian deadlifts by [anchoring the band around a tree etc](https://youtu.be/5TtY68ktfII?t=231).
* Consider increasing the reps on the deadlifts if you find you are plateauing (only applies to experienced lifters used to training with heavy barbells). Check out [this](https://youtu.be/rjC1VBuqs8s?t=137) video by James Grage for ideas. You could also try the [Nordic curl progression](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/hinge) from the original recommended routine or [squat lunges](https://youtu.be/rjC1VBuqs8s?t=419).

&#x200B;

# Third Pair

* 3x5-12 [Banded Bent Over Rows](https://youtu.be/bLZQ7tBJYQ4?t=689)
* 3x5-12 [Banded Push-Ups](https://youtu.be/4pknEoBxnzs?t=470)

**Notes:**

* Start with bodyweight push-ups and add a band when you need to increase resistance. I[ncorporating a twist](https://youtu.be/AhdtowFDKT0?t=450) will create adduction and lead to better overall chest development.
* More experienced lifters could swap to decline push-ups 1x per week to target the upper chest more, or incline push-ups to target the lower chest if necessary.

&#x200B;

# Optional Abs

*This has been updated slightly the original version. I decided to replace the oblique exercise, since the new one uses the same setup as the banded crunch and is more effective than side bends anyway. I have also added serratus punches, which will develop your midsection and improve overall shoulder health, leading to increased performance on upper body push exercises like the push-up. I suggest cutting your rest time right down here and performing this as a superset, since these exercises isolate different muscles. The other main change is the removal of standard planks, since* [I don't think they are a very good way to use your ab training time](https://youtu.be/ZyWEXjdAGCQ)*!*

**For men:**

* 2x10-15 [Banded Reverse Crunch](https://youtu.be/PSA_YApzY6I?t=472) (lower abs)
* 2x10-15 [Banded Corkscrews](https://youtu.be/OhOe6yA_zYk?t=439) (obliques)
* 2x10-15 [Banded Crunch](https://youtu.be/ajoARsE1h7I?t=82) (upper abs)
* 2x10-15 [Serratus Punches](https://youtu.be/OhOe6yA_zYk?t=67) (serratus)

**For women:**

You should train your obliques, but it might be best to avoid *weighted* oblique exercises like the banded corkscrews, since they could lead to a more square body shape (see [here](https://cathe.com/should-you-train-your-obliques/), [here](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-ab-exercise-women-shouldnt-do.html) and [here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/is-your-ab-workout-making-you-look-fat) for more info). There are conflicting opinions on this, but I think for a beginner routine the safest option is to pick a bodyweight oblique exercise and then choose an exercise for the rectus abdominus that is similar intensity. It's also a good idea to try and include another exercise that works the posterior chain (who doesn't want more glute training?). Here is my suggestion below:

* 2x10-15 [Reverse Crunch](https://youtu.be/3mb2tWu2j-s?t=109) (lower abs, add a resistance band or swap to a harder lower abs exercise if this is too easy)
* 2x [Banded Glute Bridge/Abduction Ladder](https://youtu.be/2jMjOsj8pMQ) (glutes, hip abductors)
* 2x10-15 [Frog Crunches](https://youtu.be/Q9-WwsT5Fxc?t=71) (upper abs plus obliques)

You could also combine the frog crunches with [frog pumps](https://youtu.be/rzjQ8XpXt1Q) instead of the glute bridge ladder.

**For both:**

* 1x10 [Cat Vomit](https://youtu.be/wejm0cGqv3Y)

**Notes:**

* The rest of the exercises in the workout will hit the abs, so depending on your goals you might not want to do extra ab work, especially if you are also doing other activities that work the core on your 'off days'. Abs are mainly made in the kitchen first, so as a complete beginner you will probably benefit most from keeping your workouts shorter and focusing on nutrition instead of extra ab training. That said, if you do choose to do extra ab training it will only help your performance on the other lifts.
* The single set of cat vomit (yes, cat vomit!) at the end will target the transversus abdominus, which is a deeper muscle below the lower abs. See [here](https://youtu.be/gDx1xfSobG4) for more info on how to do it properly.
* You could do a 5-10 minute full ab workout instead of these exercises. There are plenty of good examples on [Athlean-X](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDCav24/videos). These could be swapped to your rest day if you want to save time.
* If you want a quick exercise to throw in at the end of your workout instead, give [this](https://youtu.be/OHENwLGrOYg) a try! It works your entire core as well as your upper back.

&#x200B;

# Optional Extra Arms

* 2x8-10 [Banded Bicep Curls](https://youtu.be/4pknEoBxnzs?t=317)
* 2x8-10 [Banded Triceps Extensions](https://youtu.be/4pknEoBxnzs?t=386)

**Notes:**

* Skip this if you are a beginner.
* The rest of the exercises in the workout will hit the biceps/triceps and are enough for most people. Only do this at the end of the workout if you want to maximise arm definition. Women in particular might want avoid this or do a couple of extra glute/hip exercises instead such as [glute kickbacks](https://youtu.be/hz9CoNlzoo8) or [glute pull throughs](https://youtu.be/NEDrQPoITMc).
* You can superset this to save time (go straight into the triceps extensions with little to no rest time after the bicep curls).
* You could also incorporate different isolation exercises to fix muscle imbalances or get a boost on an area you are lagging behind in. Examples include calf raises, lateral side delt raises, chest crossovers etc. I suggest adding these in as part of a superset instead of replacing the arm exercises. For example you could do biceps, triceps and calves 2x per week and biceps, triceps and chest crossovers 1x per week. That said, if you reach the point where you consider adding extra isolation exercises you should probably think about [developing your own intermediate routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/training_guide#wiki_developing_an_intermediate_routine)!

# Modifications for Women - Update 28/05

The original version of this routine only differentiated between men and women with abs, since the goal here as a beginner is to build up a good baseline of full body strength. However, you should start off as you mean to go on. I think most men (i.e. not athletes, competitive bodybuilders etc) should want to train for [full body strength plus upper body aesthetics](https://bonytobeastly.com/ectomorph-aesthetics-full-article/), whereas most women should want to train for [full body strength plus lower body (mainly glute) aesthetics](https://bonytobombshell.com/bombshell-aesthetics-building-attractive-female-body-imaginable/). However, women will often [restrict calories and avoid heavy resistance training](https://bretcontreras.com/how-to-attain-a-slender-look-like-jessica-alba-zoe-saldana/), which can be a mistake if you care about functional fitness and overall health. An hourglass still has shape at the top so you don't want to neglect your upper body (especially as a beginner still looking to grow muscle rather than maintain it), but it would be irresponsible of me to leave one of your most important exercises, the [hip thrust](https://youtu.be/ICNKes9ys3o), out of the main routine. To make room for glute bridges/hip thrusts and prioritise the lower body, you could do the workout as follows:

**First Pair**

3x8-15 [Hip thrust](https://youtu.be/ICNKes9ys3o) or [glute bridge](https://youtu.be/GdSolgmyW68) \- see [here](https://youtu.be/2xtjzz3Ex14), [here](https://youtu.be/EunYa1_-B54) and [here](https://youtu.be/jKmOxSXTpDo) for more ideas on how you could do these depending on what equipment you have. I suggest starting with the 'glute bridge' version since this is easier for beginners to learn and doesn't work the legs as hard. Pause at the top and squeeze your glutes to increase time under tension. Resting your head on a cushion will avoid extra pressure on your neck and [encourage good form](https://bretcontreras.com/10-steps-to-the-perfect-hip-thrust/).

3x8-15 Lat pulldown or 3x5-10 pull-up

**Second Pair**

3x5-12 [American deadlift](https://youtu.be/pdVrGHv9YUs) \- this looks the same as a Romanian deadlift, but you are focusing on the glutes instead of the hamstrings

3x5-12 Overhead squat or front squat

**Third Pair**

3x5-10 Overhead press or 3x5-12 bent over row (I suggest you alternate these each workout, so week 1 you would do press, row, press and week 2 you would do row, press, row)

3x5-12 [Glute bridge chest floor press](https://www.advancedhumanperformance.com/blog/the-ultimate-glute-bridge-chest-press-exercise) or [isometric leg press push-up](https://youtu.be/i3I_eniAdf0). You can do a [flat chest floor press](https://youtu.be/h1uU13KkCXw) or regular push-up instead, but this will give you some extra glute training! Plus, 'flat chest' sounds misleading (don't worry, these exercises will lift your chest, *not* make it smaller)! [Add a band or two around your legs](https://youtu.be/EmSflSUgXro?t=48) to work your hip abductors at the same time. You could even rotate between a glute bridge press or isometric push-up on days where you are doing overhead shoulder presses and an [incline chest press](https://youtu.be/saVGf7bbwDg?t=207) or decline push-up on days where you are doing rows, which will help to target your upper chest more. If you find this too hard after doing the other glute exercises, just stick to a regular floor press or push-up.

The abs section above includes the glute bridge/hip abduction ladder, but I would lean towards avoiding extra ab training until you really think it's necessary. I would still do the ladder or another a hip abduction exercise at the end of each workout though whether you are training abs or not, since this will work your upper glutes. There are plenty of banded or bodyweight abduction exercises [here](https://glutelabbook.com/pages/glute-lab-exercise-library-1). It's also a good idea to add some glute activation exercises like bodyweight glute bridges, [donkey kicks](https://youtu.be/Im5nE3J558k) and [lying clams](https://youtu.be/G3yQITNPIz8) to your warmup.

Go ahead. Work out to look good.,None,1489,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/weyxe1/go_ahead_work_out_to_look_good/,1659507727.0,"Early last year, I was over 30 pounds heavier and most would have understood why.

We were just starting to see a sliver of light through the coronavirus clouds. For over a year before that, all of us had been holed up at home. Stewing. Fretting. Worrying if this was the end of civilization. And eating. Lots of eating.

Late nights were particularly damaging to my waistline. Kit Kats, mint chocolate chunk ice cream, chips, and cookies fueled my Netflix nightcaps. Before March 2020, I was arguably in the best shape of my life. But by 2021, that was a distant memory. Size 29 waist jeans and medium shirts had been replaced with sweatpants and oversized shirts.

I was embarrassed. And I did not like what I saw in the mirror.

That’s why when the gyms opened up again, I decided to buckle down.

Sure, I was tired of how my body slogged along. My blood pressure was high along with my cholesterol. And I was teetering close to the edge of pre-diabetes. But I was primarily unsettled about how my body looked. And that was my sole motivation to make a change.

I see advice that we should primarily exercise to get healthier and not purely for aesthetics. I don’t disagree that our health is paramount and that can certainly be a reason we set out on our wellness journeys. But there’s nothing wrong with working out because you want to look better.

How we appear can deeply affect how we feel about ourselves. That, in turn, affects how we interact with the world around us. And when I looked at myself in the mirror last year, I felt demoralized. I was disappointed in myself. I was back in a place where I swore I’d never return. I chose clothes that helped me hide. And I prayed I wouldn’t see anyone I knew lest they’d see how far I had fallen.

I made consistent progress in the gym. I returned to my meal-prepping days and the fat slowly melted off, while I added muscle. It felt good. Really good.

Every few weeks, I inched closer to buckling my old pants. My shirts hugged my frame differently. My face was slimming down and I was regaining a sense of self that I’d lost during the quarantine. There’s something powerful about shaping your body. There’s something fulfilling about seeing your literal blood, sweat, and tears mean something.

I am not advocating for unsafe, irresponsible tactics to get in shape. Please don’t follow the latest TikTok trend or Instagram fitness influencer’s insane workout regimen. Lots of what you see is smoke, mirrors, and steroids, anyway.

Please don’t slash your caloric intake by eating celery and air. Most of us have no desire to disrobe and show our naked torsos to the rest of the world. Most of us don’t have any interest in stepping on stage in a bodybuilding competition. That seems to be the reason I see people denigrate working out to improve their appearance. They cite social media extremes.

What I am about is finding meals and snacks that don’t taste like sewage to replace what might be a diet primarily of burgers, pizza, fried chicken, and ice cream. But I am also for indulging every day. I’m still eating my cookies, Kit Kats, and ice cream. Just not in bucket loads. I am all about putting a decent amount of effort into your workouts consistently. Build up a sweat. Get your heart pumping. I did that consistently and that’s what it took for me to see a change.

And I did it because I wanted to look good.

Now, I do.

I don’t say that arrogantly. I say that because I’m proud of myself. I built my body through my own willpower and action. I’m back in the 29-waist jeans and my medium shirts. I’m more confident. I see and tackle my challenges differently. I walk taller, shoulders back, head up, looking life squarely in the face.

You might think a smaller waist and bigger arms are all vanities, but for me, it’s made a world of difference. "
I did my first unassisted pull up!!,Cement4Brains,1490,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/acyx2f/i_did_my_first_unassisted_pull_up/,1546726240.0,"This is huge for me. For two years I have been on and off using the assisted pull up machine. I had no results until I fully delved into this sub and worked through the RR progressions, starting about two months ago. 

Started my warm up today with some dead hangs and felt like givin'er. Did two in a row!! The system works!

This program, consistency, and body awareness got me to this point. I am so excited to take this win and continue to focus on scapula pulls, etc. and my pull up form as I increase my max no. of reps. 

Happy new year everyone!!! #NewYearBetterMe


**EDIT:**

A user below (now deleted) made a pretty rude comment and deleted it before I could respond. I typed this all up though, so here's my backstory if anyone gives a shit :)

""A little context:

- I've never been overweight. Skinny-fat at worst. I'm at my heaviest now because of muscle weight gain and generally growing (25 yo M, ~175 lbs) 

- I practiced rugby 4 days a week in high school for 4 years. But that exercise was based on running, tackling, and technical skills for the sport.

- I started weightlifting when I was 16 or so. Didn't know what I was doing, but I knew enough to focus on my form and to ask questions. Didn't stick with it regularly.

- Started university and stopped playing sports. Did a few active things here and there, tried out the 5x5 Stronglifts program but I wasn't able to focus on long-term commitment. I would be in love with it for 3 months at a time and then stop cold turkey for 6. Hiked a mountain once with my friends and loved it way more than I thought I would. 

- Graduated school and got a back injury at my part time job. Slowly made my way back into the gym, still not spending an appropriate amount of time researching or planning out my goals. Hiked some mountains in the summer. 

- Moved to a new city. Started playing ultimate with friends. Started setting goals in September. Found this sub and read the RR. Made use of the website Fitloop to look stuff up while I'm at the gym as needed. Started going to the gym right after work every other day, and once on the weekend.

- Kicked ass and did my first pull up. My goals are: multiple pull ups in a row, to do a muscle up, handstands (via Antranik's blog post) and cardio/leg strength for mountain hiking. Feeling great about my body and my progress, and only now am I truly focusing on what I really want regarding fitness."""

[NSFW]From Beginner to Advanced - My 4.5 Year Journey,SoulRavager,1485,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4djrmf/nsfwfrom_beginner_to_advanced_my_45_year_journey/,1459908550.0,"Hi BWF,

I'm a long time lurker here (with random posts here and there), but today I thought I should share my story as it hits a specific demographic that lacks examples to reference. 

I'm not young enough to reap the benefits of puberty roids but my training has been almost exclusively bodyweight strength oriented. 

**Background:**

I'm 27, 5'10"", 170 lbs. I started my training when I was 23 (135lbs) after a back injury had bed ridden me for a few months. I won't delve on this part too much but what finally got me to start taking care of myself. Overnight I signed up for Tough Mudder, giving me 4 months to train. 

**Training:**

My very first exercises came from the recommended Tough Mudder routine on their site. Every day I went to the gym and followed through its routine which was mostly bodyweight and some dumbbell work. After 2 weeks before the main event, I sprained my ankle and unfortunately had to drop out of the race. However my journey had only just begun.

Disappointed that I was unable to fulfill the very first goal I had set for myself, I started scouring the web and Reddit for a type of training I would enjoy, over the months I had grown comfortable with handling my body and realized what I was really enjoying was the control I had over myself. Eventually, I stumbled across /r/Bodyweightfitness. 

I immediately started researching everything I could about it. Reading through posts, FAQs, progresses. I had found my  new passion. I decided the best thing to do was to follow the recommended routine. I followed the routine for 1.5 years changing out techniques as I was able to progress past the 8/8/8 making sure I was continually progressing forward. I became obsessed with conquering progressions and moving to new, more advanced techniques.

Over the years since I split out to push pulls and eventually after many revisions, I've currently settled on this:

 * I try to at least get one day in a climbing gym, rollerblading or any other sport during the week.


These workouts are pretty long for most people and it took a great deal of time to ease into but this was designed specifically for my needs. 

A few things to note:

 * This is something many of you will eventually come across and it comes down to cost to benefits of the risks you take in the gym. For me, working on my one arm techniques were no longer a viable path (I quit while I was able to 3x3 OAP) as I came across a few articles warning about tendon rips especially in the rotary cuffs. Even with proper care, the risks are too high for me to risk the potential chance of having to quit training. As time goes on, more and more of my techniques will be wind down to less dangerous variations. For me, it was better to quit while ahead.

 * a big chunk of my workout revolves around prevention and recovery. This is vital for me to stay on top of my game. It took me a long time to give into putting time into stretching and warm-ups and rolling but it was ABSOLUTELY worth it.
 * Running, now I hear this a lot here and in /r/Fitness about the lack of value in cardio. This is definitely false. Fat burring aside, there are tremendous benefits to long distance running to both your cardiovascular system and your brain. These are not insignificant benefits, they will last you a lifetime (I'll post some articles later if anyone is interest). 

**Diet:**

I am proud of the diet plan I've built over the years but I'm more grateful for having to start it from scratch and knowing absolutely nothing. It gave me a great appreciation for the value of food as I was able to test the results over the years.

Here is my current plan:

* 06:45 am: Protein shake with soy milk + Creatine ~200cal
* 08:10 am: Raw honey and coconut oil sandwich + 500ml Matcha tea ~ 400cal
* 10:00 am: Avocado, mandarin orange, Banana ~ 350cal
* 12:00 pm: 300g salmon + steamed veggies ~ 500cal
* 02:00 pm: Chia seed pudding (home made recipe) ~350
* 04:00 pm: Pear + Apple ~150cal
* 06:30 pm: Yogurt + berries ~200
* 09:00 pm: Spinach salad + rotating dinner (meat based dish) ~800
* 10:00 pm: Snacks (nuts, dried fruit, dark chocolate) ~150

Supplements:

* Omega 3
* Magnesium
* Vitamin D3
* Multi-Vitamin

Things to note:

* I Work a 8-5 desk job so it's easy for me to schedule my snack and lunch times. This may not be the case for everyone. 
* After many years of controlling my diet, I've become very comfortable controlling my weight. For me, this is the ideal weight to meet all my criteria.

 **Progress pictures:**

I unfortunately don't have many from my previous life but here area couple for your reference:

**My influences**

* Shout out to Daniel from [FitnessFAQ](https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessFAQs). He was a great inspiration and a great resource for me I owe much of my knowledge to him.

* The ex powerlifting  monk in my Gym. he helped me understand the importance of balance, recovery and stretching. 

* My brother who played a big part in designing my diet

* And lastly but not least, /r/bodyweightfitness. There are so many gems that come across this subreddit that even at my point in development I find things I knew nothing about

**Final Thoughts**

There are a lot more things I want to talk about but I think I want to focus the last point on setting self-oriented goals. My goals were always oriented towards reaching the next progression and it paid off immensely. I had a lot of backlash from people saying I looked too big and bulky or that I was too serious about going to the gym or that I looked good enough and that it was time to stop. I informed them each time that I'm not training for them or anybody else. I train for myself. To me, looking a certain way was never the goal, it was only the byproduct of my progress. 

Bottom line is that this is your fitness journey and it's one you want to continue for life. Make yourself the protagonist of your story. 

Hope someone finds this useful. Happy to answer any questions.

**EDIT:** I honestly didn't expect this much attention. I am very grateful to all your kind words and the individual who popped my guild cherry. I'm currently at work but I will try an answer all the questions people have during my breaks. 

**EDIT 2** I am back to answer questions individually. However, a common question that comes up is about my diet and supplements. My diet has been developed over years and the focus of it has changed towards longevity and maintenance specifically the brain.

A lot of the items I choose in my diet must meet a very specific criteria. I aim for high nutrients and antioxidants. If you look at my list only a couple of items are specifically for my mass and protein. Most of it help with cell repair and maintenance.

Your diet now has ever lasting effect on the quality of life you'll have for the rest of your life. Be smart with what you're putting into your body. Numbers alone don't tell the whole story about what's going into your body. However, THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE HEALTHY, you're just increasing your odds to have a healthy life.

**EDIT 3**

BENEFITS OF RUNNING:

Exercise reduces prevalence and protects against neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021169 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174783

Exercise prevents and protects against cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, etc): 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017149
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26884896 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139859

Exercise reduces hypertension and oxidative stress:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987496

Exercise reduces prevalence and outcome of metabolic disorders (ex:obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes):

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25738326 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26092138

A noteworthy consideration is that these studies do not look at running distinctly but equate exercise with cardiac output. So although strength training would increase cardiac output somewhat, it does not compare to the cardiac output elicited by aerobic exertions such as running, cycling, swimming, etc. It's also important to note that over-training has been associated with an increase of systemic oxidative stress and reduced longevity (reviewed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3227150/).

**LAST NOTE** I started from knowing ABSOLUTELY nothing, and I cannot stress that enough. Anyone of you can get to this stage if it's truly something you want. Starting from the bottom was necessary for me to gain to experience and knowledge to get to where I am. You don't want this handed to you. You want to earn it.

No phone, no hidden key, too early to bother the neighbors, what to do? I realized I had left [my back kitchen window](https://i.imgur.com/m3Q1yg5.jpg) open, but it's, I dunno, 7-8 feet up. 

Using the milk crate I was able to jump high enough to get adequate purchase and pull my self in. It wasn't pretty, but six months ago it never would've happened and a year ago my fatass probably wouldn't have fit through.

Just wanted to share. Being stronger is great, but being able to use that strength is even better.

The benefits of slow and steady progress,sisiphusa,1485,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/m09dm1/the_benefits_of_slow_and_steady_progress/,1615183765.0,"One thing I've realized over the last few years is the problems with the way fitness is usually written about and celebrated (five week transformation, I lost 20 pounds in six months etc etc,). A lot of articles or posts talk about radically changing your lifestyle, going from doing nothing to 6 work outs a week and eating brocoli and chicken breast for every meal.  If you read these articles too much you'd almost think that moderate exercise a couple of times a week without a massive lifestyle change was a waste of time.

For me at least, the most important thing for improving my fitness was compromise. As an example, my  current routine is much more based around exercises I enjoy doing than the optimum workout for my body type/goals. When I was younger I used to be obsessive about doing deadlifts, because everyone said they were really good for you. The problem was I *hated* doing deadlifts, and no matter how much I worked on my form I always ended up injuring myself. As a result, going to the gym wasn't that enjoyable, and my work out schedule was pretty sporadic. I'd always be losing motivation and then getting down on myself for missing sessions, which invariably led to me missing weeks at a time. Now, I have an exercise routine largely made up of bodyweightfitness exercises I enjoy. As a result, I love working out, and have been averaging 3-4 workouts a week for the past year or so. Would my exercise results be more impressive if I ended every session with 20 burpees and a bunch of squats? Probably, but knowing myself I also would start flaking out of a lot more sessions.

My transformation over the past two years or so wouldn't make a viral video. I'm not shredded with a six pack, and if you see me on the beach you wouldn't come up to me and start asking me about my workout routine. However, I've gone from a classic ""skinny fat"" body type in my early twenties who couldn't do a single pull up to being relatively toned and able to do multiple muscle ups. Even better, I've developed exercise habits that I hope will keep my fit and healthy for the rest of my life. 

If I could tell myself of 10 years ago anything it would be this: Being fit and healthy is about putting in place exercise habits that you can keep for years, not about murdering yourself in the gym to get a six pack that you then lose a few months later."
Here's how to do REVERSE CRUNCHES and take them to the next level. These are much more difficult and effective than regular crunches for building core and ab strength and can also utilize the upper back and glutes as well!,Antranik,1472,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8xtaui/heres_how_to_do_reverse_crunches_and_take_them_to/,1531256775.0,"Hey guys, Antranik here. Many of us know that crunches are far too easy. The intensity (load) of the exercise is quite low so it's not useful for building strength. 

***Reverse* crunches ([GIF](https://gfycat.com/QueasyPlushGoat)),** on the other hand, are quite a bit harder for the general population and there are subtle ways of making them even harder. Better yet, it's a pure bodyweight exercise as no weights or equipment are needed and can be done anywhere. Plus, it doesn't only build core strength but your upper back muscles assist as well. And the ""Bottoms Up"" variant makes use of your lower back muscles and glutes!

# Level 1: Basic Reverse Crunches [\(Video Link\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVVeZRlcuY4)

1. On Fingertips
2. On Palms

# Level 1 Tips

* If this exercise is very difficult for you, you may have to use momentum to lift the hips up initially and that's okay, as long as you LOWER DOWN AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE WITH CONTROL (reverse crunch negatives, basically). Eventually, you will be able to lift your hips up without any momentum whatsoever. 

* In general, people feel the palms flat version is harder than on fingers... *however...* if your fingers are weak and/or you have excellent shoulder extension, you may feel the palms flat version is easier, so master both versions.

# Level 2: Intermediate Progressions

In the [second video,](https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M) I introduce the ""hands up in the air"" variation and then the ""bottoms up"" variation below... and I also show how to use a blanket as a prop to protect ya neck! Safety first!

1. Reverse Crunches with hands up in the air ([cued](https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M?t=17s))
2. Bottoms Up version on Fingertips ([cued](https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M?t=1m16s))
3. Bottoms up version with hands up in the air ([cued](https://youtu.be/rnQtIGJm20M?t=2m10s))

#Level 2 Tips

* **Intermediary tip:** If doing any reverse crunch variation with both arms up in the air is much too difficult, yet doing it with both arms down is far too easy, then you could do it with one arm down and the other up as an interim progression.

* For the bottoms up variant, if you want to hold it statically, you may find that you will have to push your head back against the floor to find the balance. This will strengthen your neck extensors. Also, while it will be difficult to reduce your pike completely, as it requires a lot of neck flexibility to do that (and core strength), it's an admirable goal you should aim for.

**Recommended Modification for maintaining Neck Safety during the ""Bottoms Up"", Yogic Shoulderstand and Dragon Flags:**

* These exercises are nothing new but nobody ever mentions how important it is to protect your freakin neck!

* Use folded up blankets placed under your upper back to reduce the neck flexibility required to perform this exercise properly. If you have lots of experience with the [shoulderstand in yoga,](https://i.imgur.com/3Y20E54.png) then you'll likely be fine, but if you don't, it's best you use blankets. 


#Level 3: Dragon Flags & Dragon Presses

* If you have mastered the above variations, you could begin working towards [dragon flags](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2g3gtj/technique_thursday_dragon_flag/) and [dragon presses.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRmtTxwBlsY) Dragon presses are similar to a Front Lever or Victorian except it's done on the floor and doesn't require any equipment. However, they are as difficult as the front lever, if not more difficult. I recommend mastering the one-leg tucked versions first before trying to do it with both legs straight.

What I observed after 2+ years of pull up/push up training and what really works/do not work,pubster_lim,1464,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ix0ecg/what_i_observed_after_2_years_of_pull_uppush_up/,1600694875.0,"2018 : 37 years old, 1.74m, 65kg, 1-2 pull up

Current : 39 years old, 60kg, 14 pull up [current pic](https://imgur.com/8VfUdOK)

TLDR :

1. Daily calorie intake is the most important factor in helping me achieve my current physique. (Excessive protein don’t seems to work for me so just getting 1.2-1.6g per kg)


2. I only do pull up and push up. Previously I’m pretty slack from 2018-2019 with only 0-2 workout per week. The COVID in 2020 give me much more free time to do 2 pull up sets, 2 push up sets per week(not every week but most of the weeks). Seen much more gain in muscle mass in these few months than last 2 years.


3. Surprisingly, still lazy with ab work, with many weeks of 0 abs workout and maybe 1-2 per week if I somehow felt motivated. Guess getting lean enough still help with visible abs.


Expanding on the points here.

Regarding calories intake, I felt it’s the factor that helps me the most to achieve my current physique. Consistent daily calorie deficits really help to lose the body fats. Need not to be much. Need not to be on the point daily. Just maintain 100-300kcal deficits on most days. I’m a lazy slacker by nature. So being diligent and precise at daily calorie intake is not my forte. Instead, I aim for 80-90% adherence to my diet. As long as I get some deficits (amount don’t matter) on most days, 1 or 2 or even 3 days in a month where I eat slightly more, I don’t beat myself up. I will eat and enjoy the food, knowing I will be on my calorie deficit diet again on the next day. (My slightly more can be 500-1500kcal more than usual but normally it don’t exceed 1000kcal). My prudent nature also leads me to over estimate calorie in my food so that might actually help in increasing the real calories deficits each day.

In term of protein, since I tracked my meals, I realised that during my initial journey when I always try to hit 2g per kg, I did not see much improvement in muscle mass. That may also be due my lazy slack nature (0-2 workout per week). I did my workout much more consistently during COVID, although my protein intake drop to 1.2-1.6g per kg, I see much more growth in muscle mass. Will I grow more if I taken 2g instead? I doubt so. I feel I am simply not working out enough to actually utilise the protein consumed. So no worrying about not getting enough protein on some days. 1.2g on that day is ample and there is no need to go out of my way to try squeeze in some protein during the end of the day. If I need to up my game of muscle gains, I should find more progress in getting my lazy ass to fit in more workout, and not trying to squeeze in more protein in my diet.

In my exercise regimen, I opt for push up and pull up. Easiest option for me since I do not have any equipment except for a pull up bar. They are enough for me to get to my current physique. Not the best compared to many others but personally, I felt it’s enough for me.

Also, since I work from home, I do my sets throughout the day with 30-90 min break in between. Normally I opt to do 80-90% of max rep with 4-8 sets per day. Depends on how busy the day is or how motivated I can get my lazy ass to move...

Lastly on abs, I truly super slack on this. There are many weeks with no or 1 feeble attempt at abs workout. Then there will be 1 week of feeling motivated after watching some youtube videos and manage to get more abs workout done. I estimate I do my abs workout at max of 4-8 per month. Truly horrendous. 

Just sharing my observations and what works for me. Hopefully it can work for others too.

(I’m a lazy slacker by nature. So I need to find a way that works for me. Keeping a detailed, exact daily calorie plan is out for me. Instead, I aim for a consistent deficits regardless of amount. 80-90% adherence works for me.

Keeping a strict workout routine is also out for me. Instead, I tell myself to workout at least 3-4 days a week. Minimum 4 sets. Will push more on days when feeling motivated, and also push myself for the minimum sets if my lazy nature is acting up.

Just wanted to let the others fellow lazy slacker folks know that we lazy folks can also achieve a decent physique and strength. Might not be impressive but at least above average when compared to the sedentary office folks. I know, my benchmark is very low. What do you expect from a lazy ass like me. Lol.)

Edit 1 : Thank you for all the comments and compliments. I greatly appreciated it. Someone mentioned that I should include my running into the main post. I forgot about it and should have mentioned since it will help with the calories burn. I run much more during the COVID (during May onwards after we are allowed to go out of our home to run). Currently I'm running 3 times a week, 30-75 minutes each time."
List of muscles tight/weak muscles if you sit down a lot (this causes postural imbalances),Azar_,1457,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a5j9u2/list_of_muscles_tightweak_muscles_if_you_sit_down/,1544629569.0,"If you sit down a lot, chances are that most of the these muscles will be **tight**:

* Hamstrings
* Upper Quads
* Hip flexors
* Biceps
* Claves (if you don't have them flat on the floor) (*thanks to iwhalewithyou*)

(*if you sit completely straight, the list would be over)

(*if you instead have more of a hunch over position than the list continues*)

* Pec major and minor
* Abdominal muscles (those might be just slightly tight)

The **weak** muscles would be:

(*Weak muscles doesn't necessarily refer to the muscle being actually weak, as in not developed, the muscle could be strong enough but the opposite muscle might be too tight for it to have an impact on posture*)

* Glutes
* Lower quad
* Triceps

(*if you have a hunch over position the list will also include*)

* Lower back
* Rhomboids
* Lower traps
* Erector spinae

In order to cure the imbalances, you will have to stretch the tight muscle and strengthen the weaker ones (sometimes this step in not entirely necessary as I explained above) also actively thinking to stay in a better posture will help.

There are many other postural imbalances that lead to a multitude of different postures, this list will change based on the one your have, however I want to emphasise that those are the muscular imbalances that people who sit down a lot will suffer from.

Edit:I have forgot to mention that you will want to work your rotator cuffs when it come to adjust the shoulder position, however the last exercises in the list in the comments will work on them if done correctly. (*thanks to motivationascending*)

[**1 Year difference comparison**](https://imgur.com/a/ARvAW0H)

As a resume I started working out in July 2020, was very skinny, and quarantine was not helping, decided to make some changes in my life and download a free app, that's when all started, have no money to afford any kind of equipment so just decided to grab a pair of chairs, use a little bit of imagination and create my own gym at home.

[**This was all that I Had**](https://imgur.com/a/cXEBTXj), was more than enough, actually, I'm still using these :)

If you want to know a little bit more you can check my previous posts to get more info:

* [**8 Months update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lmfkgd/22_male_160162cm_53_updates_4655kg_101121lbs_8/)

So what I've been doing?, just keep grinding on this ThenX app haha, right now I'm on the advanced level routine, been repeating some of the weeks because some exercises are really hard, such as inverted row pull-ups, archer pull-ups, etc.

I found a job in February and started working, as a consequence my workout routine went from like 5-6 days a week to 3-4, some weeks more, some weeks less, and lately is getting hard to exercise outside because here in Uruguay is winter and is raining a lot, so the progress got slower.

**So here are some numbers:**

* I'm **58**Kg (127lbs) - I gained 3 kilos since the last post.
* Pull-ups went from **18** to **20-21\~** reps.
* Dips went from **19** to **25-27\~** reps.
* Chin-ups went from **20** to **23-24\~** reps.
* Push-ups **50\~** reps.

Right now I'm focusing on getting stronger, really want to hold the Front Lever for a long period, doing a lot of negatives at the moment.

Aiming to unlock the [**handstand to a 90-degree hold**](https://gfycat.com/innocentdiligentcentipede) too, been working a lot on my arms/shoulders, doing a lot of negatives, and handstand endurance.

My goals for the next year are to hold the front lever for at least 10 seconds, and maybe start training for planche, will see :)

**Most memorable skills achieved during this year:**

* [Handstand](https://youtu.be/npoFTrx8PCQ)
* [Handstand Press - Tucked and Straight Legs](https://youtu.be/npoFTrx8PCQ?t=68)
* [Handstand Push-ups](https://gfycat.com/wideimmediategalapagoshawk) - [some progress here](https://youtu.be/npoFTrx8PCQ?t=143)

* [90-Degree hold](https://youtu.be/npoFTrx8PCQ?t=193)
* [Hit at least 20 pull-ups](https://gfycat.com/parchedlonejavalina)

Yup, this kind of thing keeps me motivated, a year has passed already, looking back in time I can now really see the difference, consistency is key and the best thing that you can do, make it a routine, and keep grinding, set some goals and you'll make progress in no time, promised.

Edit: holy this blow up, thanks for all the great comments and those who find this inspiring, means a lot to me, really appreciate it!!, hope the best for all of you out there, keep strong!

Edit2: some of you are wondering about my diet, I don't really have one but as I mentioned on the comments it's around 2400 to 2700 calories, lots of meat/chicken, milk and overall healthy food, I drop weight so fast, it's crazy so I try to compensate that eating all that I can, my rule it's to drink a 1lt smoothie with milk and bananas every day, but yeah that's all
PD: I drink a lot of water too.

Edit3: Some clarification here, some are implying of roids, no my folks, everyone who knows me(friends and family) could tell you everything that I've been doing, the hell I don't even aim to get bigger, I want to get stronger, set my goals on the front lever and planche and that's it, this keeps me focused and always give my best day by day.
This is just the story of an ordinary boy training for 1 hour almost every day for a year, so don't get discouraged, I'm really transparent with the things that I do, so I repeat, do not be discouraged!

Edit4: OMG there are so many comments, been reading all of them, trying to spear some time to answer, lately, I'm busy with work, thanks one more time for all the feedback and great things shared here."
My 10 Minute Nerd Neck/Forward Head Posture Program (Full Write Up and Video),berimbolosforsatan,1454,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/p9wy3h/my_10_minute_nerd_neckforward_head_posture/,1629714186.0,"Back again with another 10 minute program & video on another common postural issue: NERD NECK. Here's the video if you don't feel like reading: https://youtu.be/Zr0PBs_hhAY

One of the most common musculoskeletal conditions experienced by people who have a lot of screen time is forward head posture (FHP). Sometimes the name tells you everything you need to know. It is exactly that — your head is too far forward. Another name for it is Nerd Neck, and you can probably think of someone who exhibits this kind of posture!

When your spine is in an ideal anatomical position (i.e. your spine angle is 0 degrees or roughly vertical) then the load on your neck is about 4–5kg. If you change that angle to a not wildly uncommon 60 degree angle, the load of your head is then about 30kg.


#ANATOMY

Anatomically speaking, what is causing forward head posture?
- Thoracic flexion — The thoracic region of your spine is rounding forward.
- The middle-back muscles are stretched out and weak. These include erector spinae, middle and lower fibres of the trapezius and rhomboids.
- Muscles in the front of your neck get tight, namely sternocleidomastoid and scalenes.
- The upper trapezius fibres are often strained from the increased load of your head and this can result in shortened and strained upper trapezius fibres.
- Your deep neck flexors are barely getting used in this position, so over time they become weak and do not have the requisite strength to stop the head protruding forward
  
- When all the above combine, it becomes the perfect storm for causing you pain. Every facet joint in your cervical spine is compressed and this is what can cause headaches and lead to referred pain due to nerve impingement.
So simply by targeting each of these components of the problem we are able to make lasting changes.

Seeing as we have two groups: one group that lacks mobility and another that lacks strength, it follows that we can split the program into two parts: One to to strengthen and one to mobilise. 



---

#MOBILISING


##Thoracic Extension

Thoracic manipulation can provide an immediate relief to neck pain, so this is what we begin with.
You will need a foam roller or trigger point peanut. You've likely seen this drill, where you place your object between each vertebrae one at a time and extend back. To get any benefits in your thoracic spine you have to make sure that it is your t-spine that is doing the movement, and not simply you extending through your lower back. To prevent this, keep those abs contracted. The movement is actually quite small. Remember to breathe and work up your entire t-spine, which should take about two minutes. 

##Pec Minor stretch

The pectoralis minor is often shortened and tight in FHP and this can lead to depression of the clavicle and protraction of the shoulders — which is the opposite of retraction. This increases the demands on the upper trapezius fibres. So to give your upper trapezius a break after carrying around that big ol’ head of yours, we will perform a stretch to directly target pectoralis minor. 
The pec minor lies underneath your pec major, and the important thing to note is the orientation of the muscle fibres, this will help us have the optimal angle to stretch the pec minor.
We are going to do the classic doorway stretch, so we can hit both sides at the same time.  Raise your arms above shoulder height and rest your elbows against a door fram, the key is to have the upper angle of your arm @ 45 degrees because that is going to result in the best stretch for the pec minor. Lean forward through the door and relax into the stretch. Hold for two minutes.

##Upper Trap Stretch
To stretch the upper traps, I am going to show you a stretch that I am yet to see outside of a 2014 paper on forward head posture (Wallden, 2014). If we look at the orientation of the muscle fibres of the upper traps, the optimal way to stretch them would be to somehow pin the fibres in the bottom left corner, and tilt and twist my head away from that corner.  To do that, use a ball and place it in the bottom corner of your trap. From there you are going to slowly tilt and turn your head until you feel a gentle stretch in your upper trapezius fibre. This will make sense if you watch the video, the movement is hard to describe with words!
1 min each side



##Scalenes & Sternocleidomastoid


The scalenes and scm are muscles that lie on the front of your neck. They are involved in flexing, twisting  and tilting your head and are often overworked in nerd neck.

To stretch your left SCM muscle to start, rotate your head away from that side, towards the right side, then gently tilt your head back, to engage and stretch your sternocleidomastoid muscle fibers. Watch the video to see in detail how this backward head tilt is done. 
Now a trick: do you know where the scalenes insert? They insert on the first rib, if we take this exact same stretch and manually pin the first rib down by pinning it down with our hands. It is the same movement as the scm stretch I just described, but now we are are pinning down the insertion point of the scalenes, it helps to lengthen those muscles as well.  

To stretch your scalenes  it is done in almost the same way, but if we go back to the picture, we can see that the scalenes insert on the first rib. If we do not pin the first rib down, we can not stretch the scalenes effectively. Essentially this stretch is the same, with less of a rotational component.
3x 10 each side.

#STRENGTHENING

##wall slides LOWER TRAPS

In FHP, the activity of the middle and lower fibres of your trapezius is diminished. So, we need to strengthen them.Everybody ignores the mid and lower traps. Most people would be hard pressed to name at least one middle or lower trap exercise. Classically, people view the upper trapezius fibres as the entire trapezius itself. The trapezius is actually quite a large muscle, which originates in the occipital region of your spine and inserts on the back of your collarbone, as well as your acromion process and scapular spine.

To perform the wall slide, we are going to begin leaning back against a wall with our feet about 30cm from the wall, place our hands and arms flat on the wall above your head - if you can not achieve this, move your feet further away from the wall.From here we are just mimicking the motion of a pull up, driving our elbows down towards the floor and focussing on pulling our shoulder blades down towards the floor as we get to the end range of the movement - pause at the bottom of each rep, focussing on the contraction between and below your shoulder blades.
3x10

##Superman


The trapezius is a broad muscle on your back that can be grouped into 3 functional regions: the upper fibres, the middle fibres and the lower fibres. The lower fibres of the traps are weakened, so we will address that by doing supermen. Two of the movements that the lower traps are responsible for are retraction and depression of the scapulae, which is the squeezing of your shoulder blades back and down, respectively.  To perform the superman, we are going to lie face down . As your lower traps might be quite weak due to inactivity, we will start with our arms down by our hips. We begin the movement by lifting our chest and hands off the floor externally rotating our hands and once we are at the top of the movement we squeeze our shoulder blades back and down. Over time as our strength increases, we can progressively overload the lower traps by trying the following positioning of our arms.  The W, T and the Y. 3 sets of 10.

## CHIN TUCK DEEP CERVICAL FLEXORS
Lastly, we have the deep cervical flexors which as the name suggests act to flex the cervical region of your spine as well as stabilise that region.  To activate and strengthen these  muscles, we are going to perform the chin tuck. The best way to think of this is that you're trying to give yourself a double chin, keep your gaze straight ahead and tuck your chin . The important thing is that we do no tuck our chin to our chest by simply flexing at the neck, as that won't target the deep cervical flexors.

1 Year Transformation: Building an Athlete body,rockentry,1449,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/69o52y/1_year_transformation_building_an_athlete_body/,1494112007.0,"watch: [Transformation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab8ojcPCU0Y)

Hi guys, In this video I wanted to share my 1 year transformation story this video is short but straight to the point. The year 2016 was the hardest time of my life I was going through depression lost my job lost my girlfriend and focus on taking care of my sick mother who has cancer and those of you who know it takes major part of your life. I was gaining weight and not doing much for myself just felt sad all the time BUT one day I went climbing just for fun with my best friends and saw this one dude… shirtless climbing like a BEAST! and his physique was so inspiring and amazing I was like… “I want that” so… from there not sure what the hell happened but it changed my life. I did so much research and started training.. fast! from there on I worked my ass of and dedicated myself to do this for a year and if I really wanted it I had to work for it! I would always go by this quote “He who says he can and he who says he can’t are both usually right” Also, today is a special day…my mom is going through a tough procedure which is bone marrow transplant and I was fortunate enough to be the cell donor. We all have our struggles and problems… It’s what you do with it that counts. What are you going to do about it?


Hope you guys enjoy the video I sincerely worked really hard because I know in reality it might change one persons life. Like it changed mine. Thank you!


**BEFORE:**
date: may 2016
age: 30
height: 5’6”
weight: 177lb
body fat: 27%

**NOW:**
date: may 2017
age: 31
height: 5’6”
weight: 138lb
body fat: 12%

**TRAINING:**

- Olympic rings:
	1. ring flys - 4 sets till failure
	2. ring dips - 4 sets till failure
	3. ring pull-ups - 4 sets till failure

- HIITS: For hiits I would do 1 set per exercise ( pushups, plank, leg raises, kettle bell swing ) and have 10 sec rest before starting the next set.
	1. pushups - 4 sets till failure
	2. plank - 4 sets till failure
	3. leg raises - 4 sets till failure
	4. kettle bell swings 4 sets till failure

- Bench: I started benching with just the bar now I am benching 155lb. I would just add 5lb every other day and now just mix my bench within my workouts. I would mix my chest workouts with dumbbells as well.

YES, I did all my workout till failure and my goal was to keep my reps low so if the workout started to get easy I would make it more difficult by either adding weights or resisting bands. Seems pretty easy but the point was to make it easy for me to follow and still go ALL OUT! work HARD on training.


**OTHER EXERCISE:**
- Bouldering climbing: When I first started climbing I would only be able to do 2 days a week because my forearms would get so burned out I wouldn’t be able to climb more. I started adding climbing days  After a month and started going 3 times a week then eventually 5 times a week. I would be training first thing in the morning for about 1 hour and a half and then go climb HARD! Other days just climb all day without training to work on my technique.

- Soccer: I played soccer every friday and sunday for about 2 hours.

**DIET:**
I started eating at a calorie deficit making sure to eat 300cal below my calorie needs. I did this for about 4 months then decreased to 400cal and eventually 500cal. Again I kept my diet very simple and easy for me to follow that was my focus and goal even tho I would get little results but as long as i would get some results I was happy.

**GOALS:**
- body goals: My goal is to gain 10lb of lean muscle so I could be at 148lb and stay healthy continue to fuel my body with good nutrition.

In my climbing gym the routes/problems are graded from v0 to v12 ( v0 being the easiest and v12 the hardest climbs ) I am currently climbing v5-v6 and my goal by the end of this year is to climb v9’s… **NOTE:** the grades are crazy difficult from one grade to another.

I hope this is useful and helpful for someone out there trying to get in shape in a different way or if you find this inspiring and motivational. Thank you guys for reading and watching my video.

Details: Worked my way up to doing move phase 3. I have slacked off on it in the final month though but it's because I'm fit enough to get back into skating again (one of the reasons I wanted to get back in shape), so I've been doing that 3 nights a week instead for a while.  


Future: I need to find a way to fit both skating and working out in and use my hobby as cardio, to get to where I would like to be."
Update 2 years,None,1427,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/o75ded/update_2_years/,1624554860.0,"Hey Reddit I’m back, more knowledgeable, stronger, and better than last year, I am writing this post in hopes of helping people out, and because I am bored. Ofc you can dm me any questions or comment (preferably comments so more people can see)

https://imgur.com/gallery/ue1XpIW

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hekerz/exactly_1_year_apart_progress_my_rant_on_body/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

From last year a lot of my views have changed and some things I still agree with and some I don’t so I’m here to talk about these topics

Topic 1: training programming plateau proof

https://youtu.be/l9agGtOJWzo

last year I believed you could train hard everyday and see progress, which at the time was true but as you make progress and gain knowledge you learn how to destroy your body more efficiently and effectively. Now I need my rest days, if I train hard everyday my body would really be fried like a nugget.

Anyways compared to the way I program right now my training programming last year was pretty bad (but not garbage). Now I program in cycles, and control my parameters. With this you can overcome plateaus with no problem. The way I do my cycles is in a 4-6 week period, is set a goal, adress what needs to be addressed (parameters) make a training routine, and do it. Sounds simple but it’s complicated. You need to know about exercise selection, fatigue management, and you have to know your body, which with experience you learn to do. A got a coach which helped me learn about these things. It takes a long time to learn proper training and even longer to implement it, so if you truly want to be elite, do yourself a favor and learn!! 

Ps. I don’t train legs for muscle mass, I train them for activation, mobility, flexibility, and general health, I disagree with my statement from last year to completely avoid exercises. Now I believe every exercise can be scaled to your level, if you want to do full rom sissy squats buildup to it.

My goals right now are : full planche 5 secs, just started training for iron cross going for 3 secs, and flpu clean 3 reps with TOUCH

Current level: https://imgur.com/gallery/HPFjfu8

Also Understand what you’re training for, hypertrophy and strength training are very different things. Hypertrophy is very fatiguing and strength training shouldn’t be, that being said if you train for hypertrophy thanks to the fatigue buildup your strength training will suffer. Program accordingly, THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO BEGGINERS.

Topic 2: nutrition gaining muscle. THE SECRET TO GETTING LEAN

https://youtu.be/XDzIT4yKU90

Same as last year, low calorie foods, lots of food low calories means you get to eat a lot more food and stay satiated. I don’t count calories anymore, the way I stay lean is every morning I look in the mirror and decide if I need to eat more, less, or keep doing what I’m doing, I don’t even have to step on the scale. compared to last year I use to count calories, but now I don’t, the time I spent counting calories was very helpful and I recommend some of you guys do it for atleast 1 week, I gave myself the knowledge to be able to look at a plate of food and estimate how many calories it has, it’s helpful. I still agree with the fact that you DONT HAVE TO BULK TO GET MUSCLE. Just eat untill your satisfied, with this method I now weigh almost 8 pounds heavier than what I did last year.


Now the secret to getting lean, ready??? Ok the secret to getting lean is… BUILD HABITS!! what’s a habit? Something you repeatedly do sometimes without even thinking about it. Well how do I build habits? Theirs a few steps which are simple to implement I’m not going to go very in depth but I’ll give you some pointers; use the least amount of will power as possible, make your new habit very convenient and enjoy it, to break bad habits like eating junk food, make the habit invisible and unattractive. Invisible- don’t buy it in the first place (you won’t get cravings to eat donuts if you can’t even see them let alone having them cross your mind) and make it unattractive by reminding yourself that certain foods are bad (donut - high in calorie, low in protein, doesn’t help me get where I want to be, I don’t want it.) ofc this doesn’t mean DONT eat junk food, just point it out verbally for example: I see a donut, it’s high in calories and it won’t help me with my goals, but it tastes good and I want to eat it, so I will. Everything humans do is based on habits and building new ones can be very helpful, nutrition is just one of the ones I implemented in my life.

Anyways I recommend getting the book atomic habits, I’ve been reading it and it’s been helpful, not only with nutrition but with other habits. Ofc any questions comment or dm

Topic 3: my life and whatever else

Lots have changed and lots haven’t compared to last year.I still love anime! My favorite is one piece. 

Back then I use to use motivation to train but now I don’t (it’s a habit :O) like j cole said “their is no homeless man in the streets hungrier than me” that’s me with calisthenics.

Compared to last year 2 years of training experience in total, year 1 general fitness, and this update is when I took calisthenics seriously as a sport 1 year, so it’s technically 1 year anniversary of doing calisthenics seriously. But all around 2 years in total

Books I recommend: atomic habits, and the 4 agreements, I started reading some time ago and it’s very enjoyable especially when listening to Lofi music

Anyways any questions I’m happy to answer I know I probably did a bad job with this update but I tried my best!

Also lots of people ask me to coach them, and what not, dude I can barely even train myself how I’m I supposed to coach you lol although I will help you with the knowledge I have for free

And yes I was wearing a straw hat like luffy does during my planche training haha

Edit: thanks for the awards, if this post was able to help atleast one person I would consider the time I spent writing this (which wasent very long) worth it. Also I feel honored that one year ago I was able to inspire people with their goals

Also I forgot to write about this topic

Topic 4 INJURY PREVENTION

I believe that every exercise can be scaled down to anyone’s level, using the proper equipment and training practices this is 100% fact. Now if you’re training something that your body is not prepared for you are bound to run into issues, this applies with any movement being too hard, practicing a movement too often are common examples. I have never been injured because I believe I’m good at preventing them (also I know that injuries are bound to happen even if you do everything safely but that’s besides the point) anyways the ways you prevent injuries are by controlling your parameters, Sets per week, And tempo are very helpful. A slight tweak of reducing your sets per week can help you prevent injuries 100% also tempos… fast for strength, slower for hypertrophy ultra mega slow for learning a movement and rehab. These are just 2 examples that you can control with ease there are many more.

The most elite athletes are able to do very advanced movements almost daily because they’re very good at controlling parameters. So take this into account!!


Anyways see you guys next year for update 3 if I remember, also sorry for all the edits. Just trying to make the post better"
Weight Vest That Won't Get the Cops Called on Me,None,1409,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/eumzc2/weight_vest_that_wont_get_the_cops_called_on_me/,1580126302.0,"  Hey, so I know it's a weird title but I've just had my second run in with law enforcement after working out at a park with my weight vest. It's a bigger one I got a couple years back, Valeo brand off amazon, loads up to I think a total of 45 lbs, is covered in little pockets for the sand bags and it's all black.  

  
  I work out at a public park with a fitness area with pull up bars, parallel bars, etc. and it hasn't been an issue when I'm there without the vest. It's normally totally dead, very rarely is anyone else working out other than the occasional jogger/dog walker. I wore the vest once last year, about 30 mins into my workout had Law Enforcement roll up and come talk to me. They were cool, I mean it's obvious what I'm doing with my fucking rings hanging off the bar in gym clothes but I guess someone saw me with the vest and called. They didn't tell me I had to stop wearing the vest or do anything differently but honestly it was stressful and I didn't want a repeat of the encounter.  

 
  So I stopped wearing the vest for about a year just to avoid freaking anyone out but I'm at the point now where I need the added weight. I bring the vest yesterday, get halfway through my workout and up rolls a K9 unit, he parks on the street about 50 ft away from me and just sits there. He never gets out, just sits there for my entire workout. I finish my workout, break down my rings, walk to my car (he's parked like 20 ft in front of me, no other cars around), I load it up and leave. As I get almost out of sight, I can see him start to pull away from the curb to leave himself.  


  I don't blame the cops for responding, I mean the first time when they actually came and talked to me they were really understanding. I figure they get a call about a guy in a big tactical looking vest somewhere and they have to respond. I also don't want to be scaring any of these fucking nervous Nellies in this yuppie neighborhood if I can avoid it. It's so strange man because I've been working out there regularly for going on two years, you'd think the people around there would recognize me at this point.  


  If anyone has a recommendation for a +25 lb weight vest that's gonna make me look less suspicious to people I'd really appreciate it.  

  EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, guys! I'm going to mark up my current vest with high visibility tape and just keep wearing it every time I workout. Hopefully with some time people will realize I'm not the world's worst terrorist trying to get some front lever progression work in before a mission. Thanks again!"
Got tight lats/shoulders? Want a straighter handstand? A nicer downward dog? Better posture? Check out this scrumptious stretch I do everyday that helps loosen up my lats and shoulders!,Antranik,1415,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/62blz7/got_tight_latsshoulders_want_a_straighter/,1490844388.0,"As the final video to my [cat/cow series,](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6000aa/catcow_is_a_basic_spinal_movement_thats_useful/) I want to share this stretch I did nearly everyday for over a year before I stopped feeling its benefits. It feels so wonderful and scrumdillyumptious that it makes me happy to finally be able to share it! It's not a particularly ""intense"" stretch... it's more like a dynamic stretch I do that helps me limber up and reset my flexibility super fast. You'll definitely feel it if you got some tight lats. Try it and let me know how it goes! (and make sure you put your knees far back enough as I instruct!)

Wrist and Ankle Strength Tutorial,Awarenesss,1405,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hkkk7o/wrist_and_ankle_strength_tutorial/,1593788482.0,"This tutorial is meant to develop both mobility and strength in the wrists and ankles, two common weak points in athletes. I run technical, rocky trails regularly and used to handbalance almost every day and have never had a wrist or ankle injury using these protocols. While I have no problem with people using this, please give me (u/Awarenesss) credit if used elsewhere.

A few notes before beginning:

* Before strength is gained in any position, the position's mobility must be developed.
* There *is* such a thing as perfect alignment, but it's uncommon and often the best-case scenario. Train for worst-case scenario (poor alignment), because it WILL happen.
* Why train wrists and ankles? Both are the required blocks to basic human movement. Walking, running, and standing require the ankles. Activities requiring basic dexterity use the wrists, among other common tasks (typing, writing).
* For all stretches, no *bad* discomfort should be felt nor limits pushed. ROM progression should be gradual.
* For all strength exercises, progression should be gradual and not forced. (This will be mentioned a few times.)

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHn-Hk8OBSo](https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHn-Hk8OBSo)

Who should use these exercises?

* **Wrists**: Handbalancers, avid keyboard users, pressers (bench press, overhead press, etc—lots of stress on wrists)
* **Ankles**: Trail walkers/runners, ruckers, trickers, high-impact-sport athletes

## Wrists

There are four different types of [wrist movement](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/movement-about-joints-part-3-wrist): flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, and radial deviation.

## Wrist Mobility

Five types of wrist mobility exercises will be performed. Because these exercises target the tendons, the progression of each should be very gradual and only done by increasing the ROM. All stretches should be done on the knees and with straight arms.

All wrist stretches can be found in the following video (timestamps included in each exercise's description):

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Si1W8lSEW8](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Si1W8lSEW8)

## Pronated Extension Stretch (PESc)

1. Place the hands flat on the ground (palms down) with fingers pointing forwards
2. Lean forward at the shoulders while keeping the palms grounded

Timestamp: 0:00

## Pronated Flexion Stretch (WPFSc)

1. Place the top of the hands (palms up) flat on the ground with fingers pointing backwards
2. Lean back at the shoulders while keeping the top of the hands grounded

Timestamp: 0:12

## Supinated Extension Stretch (SESc)

1. Place the hands flat on the ground (palms down) with fingers pointing backwards
2. Lean back at the shoulders while keeping the top of the hands grounded

Timestamp: 0:20

## Supinated Flexion Stretch (SFSc)

1. Place the hands flat on the ground (palms up) with fingers pointing forwards
2. Lean forwards at the shoulders while keeping the top of the hands grounded

Timestamp: 0:30

## Ulnar Deviation Stretch (UDSc)

1. Make a fist, then place the top of the fist flat on the ground
2. Lean backwards at the shoulders while keeping the top of the fists grounded

Timestamp: 0:40

## Radial Deviation Stretch (RDSc)

There is no good stretch that targets radial deviation since the ROM is so small.

## Wrist Strength

Three types of wrist strength exercises will be performed. Because these exercises target the tendons, the progression of each should be very gradual and only done with increasing the amount of bodyweight used. Never work to failure or pain. Increasing reps is preferable to adding weight when the full version is reached.

Typical progression:

1. **Wall**: Start with no lean (90° between body and ground) and get used to the movement. Slowly increase lean (decrease body-ground angle).
2. **Knees**: Like knee pushups, use knees to support the movement.
3. **Plank**: Perform the movement in a full plank.
4. **Handstand**: Perform the movement in a handstand. To make this easier, enter into a chest-to-wall handstand and walk the hands away from the wall. This removes weight from the wrists.

All wrist exercises and progressions can be found in the following video (timestamps included in each exercise's description):

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/QWWmfPd\_4FQ](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QWWmfPd_4FQ)

## Wrist Pushup (WPU)

1. Make a right angle at the first knuckle between the fingers and palm with the fingers straight
2. Place the fingers flat on the ground and align the first knuckle, wrist, and shoulder
3. Enter knee plank or plank (if doing these in handstand, enter in handstand, then create the correct finger/hand position)
4. As you descend to the bottom of the pushup, drop the back of the hand onto the ground
5. When pushing back up and nearing the top, ""pop"" the back of the hand back up into its original position

To perform variation 2, simply keep both the back of the hand and fingers on the ground and perform pushups. Note that getting full lockout on the plank is limited by the wrists' mobility.

* WPU Variation 1 (Knees): 0:00
* WPU Variation 1 (Plank): 0:06
* WPU Variation 2 (Knees): 0:13
* WPU Variation 2 (Plank): 0:22
* WPU Variation 2 (Handstand):

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ikslel57tl0?start=30](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ikslel57tl0?start=30)

## First Knuckle Pushup (FKP)

1. Enter plank with both hands flat on the ground
2. While keeping the fingers grounded, use the knuckles to lift the wrist

* FKP (Knees): 0:29
* FKP (Plank): 0:35
* FKP (Handstand):

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYBzwF6-kCI?start=108](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYBzwF6-kCI?start=108)

## Deviation Rolls (DR)

1. Enter plank with fists
2. Lean forward while rotating the fists so the side of the index finger and top of thumb are making contact with the ground
3. Lean backwards until the original position (plank with fists) is reached
4. Lean backwards while bending the elbows and rotating the wrists so the little finger is making contact with the ground
5. Lean forwards and straighten the elbows until the original position is reached

* DR (Knees): 0:46
* DR (Plank): 0:58
* (No DR in handstand found. Please contact me if you have seen DR in handstand.)

## Other Wrist Exercises

[Novel movements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hlWgH3_0NU) for hand, wrist, and elbow. These are helpful to do once per day for 10-15 reps per exercise.

Any handbalancing position (crow, elbow lever, handstand, etc) will strengthen the wrists, especially if you're using a [cambered hand position](http://chrissalvato.com/2013/02/what-is-the-cambered-hand-technique/).

## Wrist Training Schedule

Wrist exercises need only be done once per week for 1-2 sets per exercise. These can be done at the end of a training session or in a stand-alone session.

* Stretches: 1x30-60 sec
* WPU: 1-2x5-15 rep
* FKP: 1-2x5-15 rep
* DR: 1-2x5-15 rep

The wrist strength you develop from these does not go away quickly—I have not done these in over a year, but was able to do sets of 15 with no warm-up.

## Ankles

There are a few different types of [ankle movement](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/movement-about-joints-part-7-the-ankle): dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, eversion, lateral rotation, and medial rotation.

## Ankle Mobility

Six type of ankle stretches will be performed, each corresponding to one of the types of movements. They can be done in reps or held for time. All ankle stretches can be found in the following video (timestamps included in each exercise's description):

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/8\_BVZ2knSKY](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_BVZ2knSKY)

## Dorsiflexion Stretch (DFSc)

The dorsiflexion stretch can be done on one (preferable) or two legs. Simply keep the entire foot grounded and move the knees as far forward as possible. The [soleus](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Soleus) is primarily stretched. Depending on the amount of weight and lean, this can double as a strength exercise.

Timestamp: 0:06

## Plantarflexion Stretch (APFSc)

The plantarflexion stretch is done on one leg at a time. Take one leg, curl the toes down so they touch the ground, then move the ankle forward.

Timestamp: 0:19

## Inversion Stretch (ISc)

The inversion stretch can be done on one or two legs. While trying to keep the legs as vertical as possible, roll your foot to the outside, so the larger toes come off the ground.

Timestamp: 0:34

## Eversion Stretch (ESc)

The eversion stretch can be done on one or two legs. While trying to keep the legs as vertical as possible, roll your foot to the inside, so the smaller toes come off the ground. The ESc range-of-motion is much less than the ISc ROM.

Timestamp: 0:56

## Lateral Rotation Stretch (LRSc)

The lateral rotation stretch is done on one leg. Plant one foot, then attempt to rotate the entire body, including the leg, away from the inside of the planted foot without moving it. For example, if your right foot is planted, the body will rotate left (counterclockwise about the body).

Timestamp: 2:07

## Medial Rotation Stretch (MRSc)

The medial rotation stretch is done on one leg. Plant one foot, then attempt to rotate the entire body, including the leg, to the outside of the planted foot without moving it. For example, if your right foot is planted, the body will rotate right (clockwise about the body).

Timestamp: 1:15

## Ankle Strength

Dogen's Titanium Ankles tutorial (see below) is a great resource for general ankle strength:

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/21rwl0oWwuY?start=133](https://www.youtube.com/embed/21rwl0oWwuY?start=133)

Other strength exercises are simply variations of the stretches. The exercises can be found in the following video (timestamps included in each exercise's description):

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0PtUa7rEUc](https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0PtUa7rEUc)

## Dorsiflexion Strength (DFSg)

Similar to the stretch, attempt to hold for longer and with minimal external support.

## Plantarflexion Strength (PFSg)

PF strength is tough to train, as well as a bit dangerous. The best method seems to be a variation of the [PFSc](#plantarflexion_stretch), but with support. Using a counter/parallel bars/etc, enter into full support, then position both feet in the PF stretch position. Slowly decrease the support the arms are giving (increase bodyweight used) to load the muscles.

(Note: I strained my shins doing this, so be careful!)

Timestamp: 0:00

## Inversion Strength (ISg)

There are three options for inversion strength, all of which can be used.

The first exercise is walking while inverted: after getting into the stretch position, simply begin walking. This loads all of the bodyweight onto one ankle momentarily and can be scaled by supporting the body with the arms.

The second exercise is jumping while in inversion, like Ido Portal does in the [video above](https://youtu.be/HHn-Hk8OBSo?t=55). Doing this on a soft surface is recommended.

The third exercise is one-leg inversion holds. Simply invert one ankle and stand on it for time. Weight can be added as needed.

Timestamp: 0:13

## Eversion Strength (ESg)

Eversion strength exercises are the same as inversion, albeit more awkward: eversion walks, eversion jumps, and eversion holds.

Timestamp: 0:45

## Lateral and Medial Rotation Strength (LRSg, MRSg)

Both lateral and medial rotation strength can be trained through Dogen's [lateral isometrics](https://youtu.be/21rwl0oWwuY?t=399) (6:39 on the video): push against the wall with both the inside and outside of the foot to train both types.

## Ankle Training Schedule

Ankle exercises will be done only once per week for 1-2 sets per exercise. These can be done at the end of a training session or in a stand-alone session.

* Stretches: 1x30-60 sec
* DFSg: 1x30-60 sec
* PFSg: 1x30-60s
* ISg: 50-100 steps or 2x5-10 jumps or 1x30 sec
* ESg: 50-100 steps or 2x5-10 jumps or 1x30 sec
* LRSg: 1x30-60 sec
* MRSg: 1x30-60 sec

The ankle strength you develop from these does not go away quickly—I have not done these in over a year, but was able to do all exercises with no warm-up.

Calisthenics is very humbling,Aschenia,1397,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n7pygi/calisthenics_is_very_humbling/,1620482804.0,"I’m a 22 M with about 2 years of heavy lifting experience. I’ve recently become interested in calisthenics and decided to take some time to really round out my physical ability and get strong with my own bodyweight. Keep in mind I’m 220lbs. This has been no easy task. I started doing the recommended routine on the BWF wiki and let me just say the DOMS are fucking real. With typical strength training, you usually experience a big loss in strength until you recover(almost like you feel you can’t lift anything), and with typical bodybuilding, the soreness is more like a lot of tightness and burning in the muscle. With this new routine, I experience both symptoms to the Max. I just completed a session yesterday and today I feel an extremely odd mix of tightness and burning, and a complete loss of my strength. Like, I can barely open doors for fucks sake. This shit is crazy and I respect all you motherfuckers that can do this at a high level. It’s crazy that something so simple like training just with your own bodyweight can be so challenging. It makes me really wanna get good at it.

Edit: just wanna throw in here that I am 6’1. 220 lbs is a lil overweight but I am by no means obese. I’m just a big dude"

Hey guys, just wanted to share my 4 month calisthenics progress/transformation photos. The left was taken mid-late October 2020. I was completely underweight and in what I would consider an unhealthy state. the right was taken February 12, 2021. I’m extremely happy with progress I’ve made and hope to continue growing larger and getting stronger. I am 5’10 weighing in at 143 pounds as of now. If anyone has any questions about my diet or routine I’d be happy to help! Cheers everyone!"
How I Got The Press To Handstand In Less Than A Year: The 4 Steps Anyone Can Take To Build An Excellent Foundation,calisthenics_hacker,1399,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dua83s/how_i_got_the_press_to_handstand_in_less_than_a/,1573384406.0,"Some months ago I did a similar post for the Handstand Pushup and received great feedback (thank you!). So I decided to post now a beginner routine for the press. For a video with the full routine click here:

&#x200B;

[https://youtu.be/s\_GAkdF\_jLo](https://youtu.be/s_GAkdF_jLo)

&#x200B;

According to multiple gymnastic gurus the press to handstand is one of the best fitness goals you can have as it’s one of the most complete bodyweight skills (strength, mobility and balance).

But at the same it’s one of the skills that it doesn’t necessarily have a simple and straightforward progression This is why…

&#x200B;

One person may need to work more on strength while another may need to improve his mobility above anything else and also you can even find someone very athletic who may just need to work directly on the movement pattern of the press.

&#x200B;

With that in mind, I tried to put a routine which covers the different areas of the straight arm straddle press so that anyone can stick to it and build an excellent foundation.

&#x200B;

The routine has 4 phases and every phase should last around 6 weeks. On each phase you’ll be doing the 4 exercises that I’ll list below. Doing this once a week is enough. Max twice a week.

&#x200B;

# Phase 1:

On phase 1 you’ll be doing what’s in my opinion the best stretch for hamstrings (Single Leg Good Mornings).

The more stiff your hamstrings are the harder your press is gonna be as it will be like if you’re trying to drive a car with your foot on the brake pedal.

To gain straight arm strength you’ll be doing the Kneeling Press To Pike. This is a great exercise for learning how to rapidly fire your shoulder and upper back muscles which is mandatory on the first part of the press.

But we can’t forget about compression. It doesn’t matter how flexible you’re that if you can’t use this range of motion on the extremes it will be pretty much useless and even dangerous.

That’s why we do compression exercises like the Straddle Pulses. Thanks to exercises like this is how you manage to lift your hips from the starting position from the press.

Finally I like to finish this with an easier variation of the press to start drilling the movement pattern. In this case you’ll be doing the Headstand Tuck Press.

&#x200B;

Exercises:

Single Leg Good Mornings: 2 sets, 10r + 10s hold per leg, 60s rest

Kneeling Press To Pike: 3 sets, 5-10r (1-2-1)s, 90s rest

Straddle Pulses: 3 sets, 8-12r, 60s rest

Headstand Tuck Press: 3 sets, 4-6r, (1-1-3)s, as much as needed

&#x200B;

# Phase 2:

To maximize mobility gains it’s good to work on both Extreme Range Conditioning (ERC) and Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF). On the first phase we worked on ERC with the pulses and now we’ll start working on PNF by doing the Seated Pike Crush.

On this phase we’ll be working on our shoulder mobility because the more you can open your shoulders the easier everything is gonna be.

For straight arm strength here you’ll be doing the Planche Lean To Press which is great for strengthening the scapula in multiple plains.

Lastly you’ll be doing a harder variation of the headstand press to increase control.

&#x200B;

Exercises:

Seated Pike Crush: 3 sets, 3 x 10/5s, 60s rest

Downward Dog: 2 sets, 10r + 10s, 60s rest

Planche Lean To Press: 3 sets, 5-8r, (1-2-2), 90s rest

Headstand Straddle Press: 3 sets, 4-6r, (1-1-3)s, as much as needed

&#x200B;

# Phase 3:

On third phase we’ll do similar exercises with the exception of the Tuck Handstand. If you’re serious about getting the press, improving your handstand or you just want a big bang for the buck, tuck handstands are the way to go.

At this point we’ll do this chest to wall to improve shoulder mobility and also increase strength. The closer you can get to the wall the more intense it’s gonna be.

&#x200B;

Exercises:

Single Leg Good Mornings: 2 sets, 10r + 10s hold per leg, 60s rest

Seated Straddle Crush: 3 sets, 3 x 10/5s, 60s rest

Tuck Handstand Wall Hold: 3 sets, 10-20s, 90s rest

Headstand Pike Press: 3 sets, 4-6r, (1-1-3)s, as much as needed

&#x200B;

# Phase 4:

On the fourth phase we’ll start using the tuck handstand we learned on phase 3 to start getting the first taste of a press. We’re gonna do that by going from a straight handstand into a tuck handstand.

This exercise is gonna teach a lot of valuable less which are key for the press, such as:

* Keeping your hips over your shoulders while you’re flexing your hips and knees to get into a tuck
* Using your traps to balance and control the movement

If the Straight To Tuck resembles the upper part of the press, the Pike To L-Sit is great for the lower part.

With the Pike To L-Sit you’ll start on the initial position of the press and you’ll lower yourself down as slowly as possible into an L-Sit. If that’s still too hard you can do it on a tuck position. Oh and use parallettes / boxes that are at least 1 foot above the floor or you’ll need crazy mobility to pull it off.

Also the beauty of doing this one is that after mastering it you’ll probably be confident to go from L-Sit to Handstand ;)

&#x200B;

Exercises:

Wall Assisted Straight To Tuck: 3 sets, 1-3r, (3-1-2)s, as much as needed

Seated Pike Crush: 3 sets, 3 x 10/5s, 60s rest

Pike To L-Sit: 4 sets, 2-5 reps, (5-2-1)s, 90s rest

Pancake Reach Stick Lifts: 3 sets, 3 x 10/5s, 60s rest

&#x200B;

# Summary (TLDR) 

If your interest in fitness goes beyond muscle I really recommend you to go for this skill. Aside from being a cool skill the press will help you target different critical areas that are normally forgotten with the typical bro routines and it will make you an overall more functional human being. 

Here are the videos for the exercises of each of phase of my beginners progression:

\- [Phase 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_GAkdF_jLo&t=52s): Single Leg Good Mornings, Kneeling Press To Pike, Straddle Pulses, Headstand Tuck Press

\- [Phase 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_GAkdF_jLo&t=2m48s): Seated Pike Crush, Downward Dog, Planche Lean To Press, Headstand Straddle Press

\- [Phase 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_GAkdF_jLo&t=4m26s): Single Leg Good Mornings, Seated Straddle Crush, Tuck Handstand Wall Hold, Headstand Pike Press

\- [Phase 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_GAkdF_jLo&t=5m24s): Wall Assisted Straight To Tuck, Seated Pike Crush, Pike To L-Sit, Pancake Reach Stick Lifts

Shoulder blade activation miracle.,Ethan-D-C,1394,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/icly0j/shoulder_blade_activation_miracle/,1597836912.0,"So, I've been lifting and doing body weight training for years now and always had nagging shoulder pain from time to time. 
So I recently saw a video from a physical therapist about tilting the scapula back rather than pulling shoulders back... Comfortable feeling pushups for the first time in forever! Holy cow though, numbers went waaaay down. Pushups went from 50 to 16! Pullups went from 12 to 2 and I'm training negatives to fix what has been a massive scapular weakness I had no idea I was offsetting with weird shoulder mechanics. 
Feeling the tension in my back rather than in my shoulder is such a relief. 

Had to learn the lesson of aiming for better reps not more reps the hard way.

Edit: Here's the video! it's linked at the time where he starts talking about the scapula activation cue https://youtu.be/ysZpy2LKYNs?t=200"

Around 130lbs in the first picture. Sitting in between 155lbs and 157lbs these days. [1.5 year transformation ](https://imgur.com/gallery/YT42MbE) 

(Edit): Followed the RR for the first year working out 3 times a week. Went from RR 3 times a week to doing push/pull/legs 6 days a week to focus on hypertrophy through weighted movements using a 20lb vest and volume. Currently training 2-3 times a week training mostly handstand, planche progression, and iron cross with some of the basic compound movements . I learned handstand, straddle front lever, 4 sec supinated back lever, 6 sec adv tuck planche,  2 sec straddle planche with alright form occasionally and a few other things. Training has been on rings pretty much exclusively and only other equipment I have besides the rings are aforementioned vest and some resistance bands for warm up and slight conditioning.

(Edit): I ate the same meals every day for the most part because it’s easier for me that way, but I wouldn’t say no to a friend wanting pizza or something like that. The meals were either slow cooked barbecue chicken thighs, brown rice and cast iron seared broccoli or homemade burgers, mashed potatoes and cast iron seared broccoli. Never really been a big junk food or dessert eater, other than my soft spot for chips, so cheat meals weren’t really an issue or concern.  I’m not quite sure how many calories I stopped counting because it would just stress me out and make me think I wasn’t getting enough food. I just learned to listen to my body, when it comes to meal size and frequency.

Been a great journey and it’s been fun mastering my body. Current goals are straddle planche on rings and floor, straddle press to handstand, full front lever, one arm handstand, as well as Iron Cross and eventually Maltese. Hoping this post can be motivational to show that you can achieve results with bwf."
[27M] I did the Recommended Routine for 3 months. Lost 8lbs. Regained my abs. Gained strength. Here is my post about the entire journey.,OptimusPrime1313,1394,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bxv1zk/27m_i_did_the_recommended_routine_for_3_months/,1559916609.0,"Hey everyone!  

So I gave the Recommended Routine a spin for 3 months and I am here to report my results! I’m 6’0. I weighed 172lbs and had a 33inch waist at the start of the program. I had gained a little bit of winter padding so I wasn’t fat, just a bit soft. 

# I compiled the video footage and talk about my entire journey here:

Final Strength tests start at 5:39 

I’ll write it out for those of you who prefer reading: 

&#x200B;

**My main goals were to (in order)**

1) Trim the fat & regain my abs 

2) Gain strength  

&#x200B;

I did so by eating at a 500 calorie deficit 5-6 days out of the week and eating at maintenance 1-2 days. It came out to around 2000 calories on my deficit days and \~2500 for maintenance.  

I used the 0.8g of protein per pound rule, so I aimed to eat at least 137g of protein each day. Didn’t really track carbs and fats but I tried to keep it balanced. 

&#x200B;

**I chose the following exercises for my progressions:** 

Pull Up: Weighted Pull Ups (Starting at 53lbs x 5 reps) 

Squat: Pistol Squat (Starting at bodyweight x 5 reps) 

Dip: Weighted Ring Dip (Starting at 44lbs x 5 reps)

Hinge: Barbell Hip Thrust (Starting at 135lbs x 8 reps)

Row: Tuck Front Lever (Starting at 20s) 

Push Up: One Arm Push Up (Starting at 8 assisted reps each side) 

Anti-Extension: Ab Wheel

Anti-Rotation: Pallof Press

Extension: Reverse Hyperextension  
 

You might have noticed that I took a few creative liberties with the progressions (hip thrust and one arm push up). That’s because I’m not a beginner and I wanted to work on those exercises in particular. 

&#x200B;

I did the program as written for the first few weeks. 

&#x200B;

I quickly noticed that 90s was not enough for me to really push hard during the strength exercises. But I also noticed that increasing all the rest times to 3 minutes made the workout a little too long for my liking. 

&#x200B;

**So I made some changes:** 

I would take 3 minute rests for the first strength pair. That way I would be fresh and really able to push the envelope. The 2nd and 3rd strength pairs I kept the 90s rest and did whatever I could with the energy I had left. 

&#x200B;

And because I would be fresh for the first pair, I made sure to rotate the exercises throughout the week so I was fresh for each of them once a week. Pull-ups/Squats on Monday. Dips/Hinge on Weds. Row/Push Up on Fri. 

&#x200B;

This change allowed me to gain a significant amount of strength. I was basically going up in weights or reps every week. It also made the workout not take as long as I was happy about that as well. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately tho, I was still pretty tired by the time I got to the core triplet each workout and didn’t have much juice left. As a result of that, I pretty much just went through the motions and didn’t progress as much on those exercises. Oh well.  

&#x200B;

**About 8 weeks in, I decided to do a check-in.** 

I noticed that I was 8lbs lighter at 164 and my waist went down to 31.5 inches. So I basically lost a pound a week during the first 2 months. I regained my abs and decided that was enough cutting so I brought my calories back up to maintenance levels for the final month of the program. 

&#x200B;

Eating at maintenance felt much better than being at a deficit. I was less tired during and after the workouts. I continued to make progress for the remainder of the program, hitting a PR pretty much every week. 

&#x200B;

**My final strength tests were as follows:** 

Weighted Pull Up: 82.5lbs x 5 reps & 123lbs for 1 rep 

Pistol: 35lb 1 rep max on the left, 53lb 1 rep max on the right 

Weighted Ring Dip: 72.5lbs x 5 reps 

Hip Thrust: 275 x 15 reps (could have gone more but didn’t really test it) 

Front Lever: One Leg Front Lever x\~10s 

One Arm Push Up: 5 reps one arm push ups on the left. 1 rep one arm one leg push up on the left. 5 reps one arm one leg push-ups on the right. 

&#x200B;

**Here are my before and after pics:**

So there you have it! That was my journey on the RR! 

&#x200B;

What have your experiences been like on the program? I personally found it to be an excellent program.  

My only critique is that it seems really high volume. I mean, there are 27 total sets! There is no way I would have been able to do that if I was an actual beginner and I struggled with the volume even as an intermediate. 

&#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts!"
My 10 Month Calisthenics journey!,ElvisLifts,1392,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gj021o/my_10_month_calisthenics_journey/,1589380022.0,"What's up everyone! I've want to share my new update on my Calisthenics transformation it's been around 4 months since I've last posted here! 

&#x200B;

Time period: 10 months 

Training type : Calisthenics 

Cardio : Running, Swimming, Cycling, Box, HIIT and some circuit training as well

 

Training schedule:

Calisthenics: 3-4 times a week 

Cardio: 3-4 times a week

Weight lifting (mostly for legs): 2 times a week

&#x200B;

Pretty much I've did something everyday but it was planned and structured so It doesn't interfere with my progress!

Progress I've made! Picture [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/bE2wYNt) \[114kg/251lbs vs 94kg/207lbs\]

In the first picture I've just started calisthenics and my heaviest weight was 114kg/251lbs. On average I was weighing 110kg. On the right picture (Second one) My weight is 94kg/207lbs. On average I weigh 95kg right now!

My transformation was not over since the last time I posted here! And the 4 extra months gave quite the difference! I will keep you guys updated and will see how far the calisthenics will take me!

I've increased my strength, endurance, cardio, and my blood pressure is now in normal range because of my weight loss, and my joints are thankful! My blood pressure used to be 170/85 which is bad... very bad even for my age! Now my blood pressure is 135/80 which is not perfect but It's a huge improvement and a lot healthier for my body! My joints are thanking me that I've lost all that unnecessary weight same with my heart! 

My diet: Pretty much high protein diet 1.5grams of protein per each kg of body weight so when I weighed 100kg I would eat around 150gr of protein a day. My TDEE is around 2300kcal so If I didn't do cardio that day I would eat around 2000-2150 kcal, but If I did cardio then I would add some extra kcal for my body to help with growth and recovery! When you eat clean and check your protein other macros will kinda fall in their place so I didn't complicate things to much. I did have my complex carbs and healthy fats tho (omega 3,6,9)

Stats:

Age: 26

Height: 1.89m/6'2 1/2 ft.

Weight: Before 114kg/250lbs Now 94kg/207lbs

&#x200B;

Progress in strength and endurance:

Pull-ups:  2 to 21

Chin-ups:  5 to 16

Dips:      9 to 30

Pull overs: 1 to 10

Muscle-Ups: 0 to 3 (at the moment I am on journey to learn 5 strict muscle-ups)

I've learned archer push-ups

I've learned one arm push-ups

I've learned archer pull-ups

I've mastered pull-overs

I am lot more comfortable with L-sit

My previous background: Is lifting weights mostly power lifting style 3-5 min rest with 3-5 rep range and 3-4 sets of each muscle group It did help my with me weight loss cause I've already had quite the muscle mass so I was able to afford to sacrifice some of that mass! Even though I was very careful and had very slight calorie deficit 100-350 

Hopefully this motivates someone and if you want to see more of me just type ElvisLifts on YouTube. If you have any questions feel free to ask me! I do have everything on video so these are not just random numbers every single thing I say has proof! My form is not perfect and I am very aware of that nobody has perfect form from the very beginning it takes time to develop good form and over the course of 10 months my form in all exercises has improved tremendously!"
Finally hit my goal of getting 20 pullups in one set!! Link to vid below.,SelfiesSuck,1393,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lgv746/finally_hit_my_goal_of_getting_20_pullups_in_one/,1612968647.0,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Onoxz32V0&ab_channel=sadatktraining (PR set of 20)
Stats: 5'10"", 170lbs (77kg). Been training since the summer of 2017. Went from 12-13 to 20 pullups in about one year.

For the longest time, I was stuck at sets of 12-13 on pullups until I made three important changes:
1. Going close to failure on every set (RPE 9 or beyond)
2. Increasing my frequency (3-5 times a week), and volume (5-6 sets/session).
3. Pausing at the bottom.

Before I knew it, I was smashing through my plateaus.

Nutrition: I should mention that I was gradually losing weight in this one-year timespan. Went from 185lbs - 170lbs. Didn't embark on a diet, just made permanent lifestyle changes such as eating more protein and less carbs and fat."

#2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)

So when I first started working out, I didn't know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn't even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn't even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn't start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn't have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn't have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.

I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn't change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.

Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn't make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.

I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It's not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)

● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)

#2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)

I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book ""Science and Practice of Strength Training"" by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and ""Building the Gymnatics Body"" by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. 

I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!

It's important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.

● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can't balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I'm not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I'm almost ready for straddle. I'm also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I'm at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I'm working on my handstand but still can't balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.

#3. Routine

I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -

Day 1. 

A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)

C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)

Day 2. 

A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)

C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)

D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)

E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)

Then repeat day 1...

Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.

#4. Nutrition

For hypertrophy or weight gain (and loss) diet is one of the most important factors. However I'm helpless in this situation. I can't afford enough food to get big. I eat what is cooked in home. I don't track my macros or calories. I eat rice twice a day (as lunch and dinner) with curries, a glass of milk, I'm not a vegetarian but I rarely eat meat because it's expensive, I also don't eat fish because it tastes very bad, I eat 1 banana before training right after waking up, 2 eggs, loads of potato and for breakfast or snacks in the evening I eat bread with peanut butter. I also drink sattu which contains a good amount of soy protein (about 20g in 100g/2 glass). I have only gained about 10lbs this year which speaks volume about my diet however there is nothing I can do about that.

#6. About me

If you are still reading this (wow lol) and if you are curious about how I got into that low weight in the first place, here's a brief history of me. When I was 9 months old I had a deseas called Steven Johnson's Syndrome (Toxic Epidermal Nacrolysis stage). It's a very rare (like one in a million in US) and severe deseas (Google for more info). I didn't die but I had permanent damage to my eyes. I'm visually impaired, have photophobia/light sensitivity (that's why I used to sleep at daytime) and dry eyes. I was in a blind boys hostel from the age of 6-12 where I didn't eat enough. My weight was very low. I used to poop like once in 2 weeks. Not to mention I incredibly weak I was. My parents got separated when I was like 10 and I stayed with my mom. I started working out not to be jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. 

And I'm totally aware of the fact that my progress is very slow, objectly it's very bad. I'm almost 2 years into it what do I have to show for it, freaking elbow lever? I can't even do a handstand or a muscle up which is nothing short of embarrassment at this point. I want to be very good at what I do, and clearly I'm showing no signs to indicate that. If I keep training hopefully this year will be better and I may have something better to show for next January. Thanks for reading this long ass post lmao"

Progressing down using elevated pushups was incredibly slow for me at first, and I felt as though I wasn't making any progress, but after about a month or so I made it and have only been getting stronger since."

I sat through mostly every Interview I could find and put together over 100 clips of actors talking about their diets, workouts and so on. https://youtu.be/RKduxJEPFHc Before you go hmhmhm I added no music, intro, talking or anything else that might be anoying. Its just the pure clips of the actors them self talking about it. To me its just fascinating when actors like Christian Bale try and become the character.

At first I wasn't sure if I should post it here but a few days ago someone in this sub asked why Calisthenics isn't more mainstream and at [50:02](https://youtu.be/RKduxJEPFHc?t=50m2s) Ryan Reynolds explained it funny and accurate in my opinion. Spoiler: Its basically about being 6' 2"" which I can relate to being one inch taller then him.

There is also Jason Statham talking about bodyweight exercises at [8:56](https://youtu.be/RKduxJEPFHc?t=8m56s). He is probably the main poster guy when it comes to actors doing calisthenics. if you check his social media profiles he always did bodyweight workouts and didn't just start working out for a movie like others.

Other then that some mentioned running, doing pushups and stuff like that but nothing special. Most of them seem to lift really heavy with personal trainers or do specific training for roles like boxing and so on.

Also something very interesting I found Russell Crowe talk about and I have never heard anyone else mention. He and others of the cast had to sign a Warner Brothers contract that would not allow them to eat anything besides the food that Warner Brothers supplied for 4 months straight.

TLDR: Lots of chicken breast & broccoli, insane calorie deficit/surpluses, heavy lifting, some bodyweight stuff, cardio, cheat meals, water cuts, lighting, pump ups between scenes... The video features the obvious ones like Henry Cavill (Superman, Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Christian Bale (Batman) & Chris Evans (Captain America) but also a lot of others I could find.

It went fine.

Right now, I'm able to do 5 pull-ups in a row, 2 minutes rest. So physically, I've made progress. However, mentally it feels like I'm getting weaker. Everytime now, I'm dreading the idea of losing my progress. I'm literally *nervous* to jump and grab the bar. Now I've noticed that my strength is declining; I have a harder time to crank out 5 pull-ups in a row. But I blame this more on the psychological stuff than the physical stuff.

Always start at your level; do not try to jump ahead in difficulty,Superstitio_Religio,1357,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mugx4g/always_start_at_your_level_do_not_try_to_jump/,1618886631.0,"Hey everyone. This community helped me a lot when I first started looking into a minimalist workout routine to build strength when the pandemic hit. So, I thought I should share one of the lessons I learned as a way giving back.

I started something like the Recommended Routine in July, 2020. It was great. I felt more challenged than in my training with dumbbells, while being simultaneously rewarded for my effort.

Only issue was that I started with gymnast rings when I had little experience doing most of the movements on stationary bars. In particular, I had never been strong enough to rely upon dips as a staple of my workout routine.

I went straight to doing dips on the rings. The first couple of workouts were tough, but I kept my feet touching the ground to make that exercise easier. However, it wasn’t long before I got impatient for results. That’s when I began pushing myself to do unsupported dips on the rings.

Only, I was not ready. The progress was tough at first, but I learned to lean forward and shift my weight in different ways so as to make it possible. I ignored the strained pain in my chest, and even sometimes did my strength training without warming up and doing dynamic stretches first. I wasn’t even doing static stretches afterward.

The pain got worse, and although I had great definition, mass and strength by the end of the summer, I had to stop training. I switched to bands while I recovered, but the pain did not go away. Now, it is over 8 months since the injury first developed and I still have pain doing even standard military push ups. I’m in physical therapy, and I will probably recover in a month or so, but the experience was not worth it.

My lesson: mobility work, stretch, proper form, and never jump past progressions when you’re not ready. Extra emphasis on proper form and stretching. Dynamic stretches at the beginning of your workout, static ones at the end (when your muscles are warmed up and less likely to get hurt). And, be careful on those ring dips!

TL;DR; I damaged the muscles in my chest from doing dips on rings when I didn’t have initial strength, had bad form, and didn’t stretch adequately. Don’t make my mistakes, please.

Edit:
u/thevengefulspartan shared this link: [fixing chest pain from dips](https://youtu.be/oj6MNlqkRfA) from FitnessFAQs channel

Looks like it could be costochondritis. Important thing is recovery is possible and hopefully won’t take too long. Good luck in your recovery, anyone else who also has this issue!"
4 things I learnt | Calisthenics body transformation (from fat to fit),eatsleephustle,1353,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aau4mj/4_things_i_learnt_calisthenics_body/,1546157011.0,"You might remember me from the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a9fkad/3_things_i_learnt_from_0_to_8_strict_muscle_ups/) where I shared the 3 things I learnt from not being able to do any muscle up to doing 8 muscle up. There were comments asking how my body has transformed throughout the whole journey and how I managed to lose 20 pounds in the first three months. So I made this [video](https://youtu.be/71DZfivhxYw) ([https://youtu.be/71DZfivhxYw](https://youtu.be/71DZfivhxYw)) (start at 2:43 to see transformation)  showing how my body has transformed from November 2017 to June 2018 (hopefully just in time to be a motivation for 2019). Here are four things I learnt from my body transformation.

&#x200B;

**1. Diet comes first, training second**

This is banality. We all know about calories deficit. We just do not have the discipline to carry out the necessary changes to our diet. For me, the process has been brutal. I ate broccoli, chicken breast and fruits only in the first three months, with a cheat meal here and then but that's it. I put  all calories dense food off my sight and fill myself up with apples whenever I felt hungry. Intermittent fasting no doubt helped too.

Many of us have this excuse that if we eat less, we have less energy for our training, and we will eventually sacrifice our performance. That is only true if you are already a pro athlete who is in his cutting phase. But if you are a beginner, this excuse does not apply as we haven't tested our limits yet and more often than not, our beginner gains will take us to levels we wouldn't have imagined ourselves reaching.

&#x200B;

**2.  Find a sport that gives you sense of achievement**

Its not within my plan to pick up a sport when i decided to lose weight. It was my intention to lose weight simply by eating clean and eating less.But two friends of mine introduced me to calisthenics and this ties in perfectly with my weight loss journey. The more weight i lose, the quicker i progress in calisthenics. The quicker I progress, the more determined I am to control my weight so I wont lose these skills i trained hard to achieve. It is a positive feedback. So who says calisthenics is not for the heavyweights? Change our mindset and we could turn our disadvantage to our advantage.

&#x200B;

**3.   Try weighted calisthenics once you mastered your bodyweight**

I started with beginner bodyweight exercises (pull up, push up, leg raises) but it didn't take long before I noticed that I was doing them in high reps (due of dramatic weight loss and progress) and those exercises fell outside the hypertrophy range. They are good at burning fat, especially when I was doing them in circuits with minimal rest time. Yet it began hard to build muscle without extra load and tension.

So I immediately switched to weight calisthenics and harder progressions like handstand pushups, ring flies, high lsit pull up. That way my rep range fell back to 6 to 8 reps and results had been obvious. Now that I am at the stage of maintaining status quo, I do super sets or even triple sets with low to medium rep range so to get my heart rate up while building strength at the same time.

&#x200B;

**4.   Calisthenics as mains and weightlifting as supplements for the best aesthetics.**

As most calisthenics moves and bodyweight exercises are compound exercises (i.e. they target different muscle groups at the same time), doing these exercises seldom lead to muscle imbalance, compared to traditional weightlifting, where there might be more chance of doing isolation exercises, if done incorrectly, tilt our body to unnatural ratios. Not to mention the frequent use of core in calisthenics will make your obliques and rectus abdominis more obvious to the eye.

That said, there are still movements that bodyweight exercises can hardly stimulate or are often neglected. That include squats (quads and glutes), deadlifts (glutes and hamstring), flies (chest adductors), rows. Of course, we could do ring flies for adduction, front lever pull for rows. But they are either too hard to perform or there are better and more direct replacements in weightlifting. Thats why I suggest the incorporation of both calisthenics and weightlifting for the best aesthetics.

Things I Know Now After Doing the Recommended Routine for 1 Year That I Wish I Knew From the Beginning.,whiteSkar,1344,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gpnigl/things_i_know_now_after_doing_the_recommended/,1590316371.0,"So I did the Recommended Routine for 1 year. I'm here to share things that I learned, things that I went through, and things that I wish I had known from the beginning. *(In case you are new to this subreddit, the Recommended Routine is on the Routines tab or the side bar of this subreddit.)*

A couple months ago, I also posted a 1 year transformation of me. If you are curious about the transformation part, you can have a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fjopup/so_i_did_the_recommended_routine_for_a_year_1/). While that post is focused on the transformations and outcomes, this post is going to be focused on the detailed insights and learnings. I believe this post will be helpful for those who are starting out or who are currently doing the Recommended Routine. So sit tight!

## Unilateral vs Bilateral Exercises

There are a few exercises in the Recommended Routine that are unilateral such as archer rows, archer pull ups, shrimp squats, and etc. **Try NOT to choose the unilateral exercises path if the progression has bilateral exercises path** (archer rows path VS tuck front lever path).

There is a reason why unilateral exercises are put in the ""alternative"" paths and not in the ""main"" path. *Shrimp squats are an exception as there is no choice unless you are doing weighted workouts (Besides, the Recommended Routine recommends doing weighted squats which is bilateral).* Unilateral exercises take twice as much time to do and exhausts you much faster. **This not only makes the session take much longer but also exhausts you faster and leaves you with less energy to do the rest of the work outs.**

I always felt so exhausted after doing archer rows and shrimp squats. I hated doing these as I knew how exhausted I will be after doing these. After I switched to doing the tuck front lever instead of the archer rows, I felt much more relieved.

You can come back to those unilateral exercises when you are less of a beginner.

## Keep Your Elbows PROPERLY Locked Out

Bodyweight exercises have lots of straight arm exercises that need strong elbow connective tissues to do without injuries. In the warm ups section, there is Support Hold which is exactly doing the strengthening of the elbow connective tissues. Even if you think you are doing it with locked out arms, make sure you are actually doing it properly locked out.

For a very long time, I thought I was doing the support hold with locked out elbows. However, I realized later that I was not doing it properly. My arms were straight but they were not locked out. So when I started doing the RTO (Ring Turn Out) support hold, my right elbow started hurting. Turning the rings out kind of forces my elbows to be locked out. However, my elbow connective tissues were not strong enough as I was doing the support hold with NOT fully locked out elbows up until then.

Connective tissues take an extreme amount of time to get stronger. **So, make sure you ARE doing the support hold and you are doing the support hold PROPERLY.** Don't wait until later. It will make your life so much better down the road when you are ready to tackle the straight arm exercises.

*Note: If you have hyperextended elbows, you need to do lots of biceps work and be extra cautious.*

## German Hang and Supinated Grip

German Hang and Skin the Cats are not mentioned in the Recommended Routine iirc. However, it's part of the warm up in Overcoming Gravity's sample warm up. *(In case you are new to this subreddit, Overcoming Gravity is a book written by one of the mods of this subreddit and the Recommended Routine is heavily based upon it)*

German hang is another must do exercise, on top of the Support Hold, to strengthen your elbow connective tissues. **I strongly suggest you to do the German Hang as part of the warm up after the Suppord Hold.** Support hold kinda hits the elbow vertically while the german hang hits the elbow kinda diagonally. Make sure to do both.

**Not only doing the german hang is important but also doing it with supinated grip is super important.** *For those of you who may not know what supinated grip is, try this: While standing, lift your arms backwards as if you are doing the Naruto ninja run. Now, make your palms face the ground. That is supinated grip. In other words, if your thumbs are pointing outwards, it is supinated and if your thumbs are pointing inwards, it is pronated.*

Back lever is to be done with supinated grip. However, since I was doing the german hang with pronated grip, when I felt I'm ready to move on to the tuck back lever, I couldn't even do 1 second of it. My body wasn't ready for supinated grip. You can start the german hang with pronated grip but make sure you progress to supinated grip as soon as possible.

*Note: Same caution as the Support Hold above*

## Exercise Order

Somewhere in the Recommended Routine or in Overcoming Gravity, I believe it mentions to put the hardest exercises in the beginning so you can tackle them while you are fresh. This would work in general.

However, I felt like after doing the pair of pull ups and shrimp squats, where pull ups is the one I felt the hardest and shrimp squat is a unilateral exercise (as I mentioned above), I already felt too exhausted. The rest of the session, therefore, would be done poorly.

With my new trained-beginner/intermediate routine I started doing after 1 year of the Recommended Routine, **I put the pull up exercise later in the session. Now I feel much more fresh for longer and can tackle the most of my session with much better condition.**

**So try both ways of putting hard ones in the beginning and putting hard ones in the end.** See which one works better for you. Switching between the two every few months might be ideal, too.

## Lastly,

[This video of mine](https://youtu.be/65w2JxSz2Fk) (It's a 15 minute video. Click only if you are committed!) will show and explain **in detail** what I went through doing each of the 9 progressions (Pull Ups, Squats, Dips, Rows, etc), Support Hold, Elbow Lever, and German Hang.

Good luck with your trainings!

Body by Rings results!,DeusExMachina25,1336,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/l7reg3/body_by_rings_results/,1611923544.0,"Before/After pictures: https://imgur.com/a/bP25B0Z

Hello there! I wanted to share with you all my progress after completing Body by Rings, the 18 weeks program made by FitnessFAQs. 

I really enjoyed the routine and I think I got pretty good results from it. It took me a while to get used to the high amount of volume, though, coming from the RR. Also, I struggled with some of the more advanced pull progressions, like archer chin-ups, but overall I would say my strength levels have increased in both push and pull exercises.

Body by Rings is meant to be a hypertrophy focused routine, and that was my goal. I started at 71 kg and after the 18 weeks I am at 75 kg (176cm), which I am pretty happy with. 
 
I eat a plant based diet, so a lot of beans, chickpeas, tofu, seitan, seeds, oats, etc. I didn’t track my calorie intake, I just made sure I got around 30 to 40 grams of protein per meal, with plenty of greens and brown rice as well. When it comes to rest, I know I could have done better. Most days I get 6-7 hours of sleep, which I think made an impact on my energy levels.

I wanted to ask you guys about what should be my next step: I was thinking about going back to the RR, but adding weight this time and doing 4 or 5 sets instead of 3, and combining it with a couple of push/pull days, so my week would look like this:

Monday: Yoga and mobility work
Tuesday: RR with weights
Wednesday: Yoga and mobility work
Thursday: RR with weights
Friday: Rest day
Saturday: Push
Sunday: Pull 

What do you guys think? My goal is still to gain a little bit of weight, do you think I’ll be getting enough volume for that? 

Thank you for taking your time to read this!"

Because of constant exercising (lifting, boxing, hiking, etc.) I'm fit, above-average strong and overall healthy. However a part of me still desires shredded abs and a pair of big guns. This is honestly my main drive to work out, for I don't really enjoy the process, unlike other sports I do. Recently I've come to the realization that a lean and muscular physique wouldn't be sustainable for my lifestyle and preferences. To get there would require too much time, effort, and sacrifices from me. Not to mention the frustration and pressure this ideal body image brings me.

How could I be happy with being simply in shape instead of worrying about not having the perfect physique?"

It’s Step 3 of the Handstand Pushup series in Convict Conditioning. I’m so fucking happy that I finally get to move on with the program. 

I did it as the book instructs, which is kicking up so your back faces the wall, hands shoulder-width apart with a slight bend in the back. I was usually able to hit 90 seconds on a good day, but almost never past 100. I think what finally allowed me to break through today was pushing into the floor more than I ever have before. I pushed my shoulders and torso as far into the air as I possibly could, and just tried to keep as much of the pressure off my hands and elbows as possible. It wasn’t easy, definitely fucking hurt, but I wasn’t trembling nearly as hard as when I just tried to lock my elbows and pray that my endurance would hold out. 

It’s almost like I forgot that I was supposed to be doing a strength training exercise. 

I’m sure this is no big deal to people who can do inverse work all day long, but it’s a pretty huge milestone for me. I can finally move on to Half Handstand Pushups. Has anyone else been able to hold a handstand for 2 minutes? How long did it take you?"

The 5 Pillars of Progress,fp_admin,1323,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/niii9j/the_5_pillars_of_progress/,1621689661.0,"Most of us struggle to achieve our fitness goals for similar reasons. We hit a plateau with our training and find ourselves just going through the motions as our motivation drops off. Even worse, we get injured and struggle to just get back to where we were before.

Here are five points that are crucial to making steady progress and shaping realistic expectations around doing so.

## 1. Consistency

*“Your success in training is the accumulation of effort over time. Any time you aren't adhering to a program is wasted time, so start, even if what you start with sucks. There is no optimal program.”* *—* u/m092

You’ve heard it before and you’ve heard it for good reason: consistency is key. Achieving any goal is simply a case of putting in the reps, over and over again. If you want to become a better runner, you must run; if you want to lift more, *you must lift more*.

Therefore, at any level of training, **consistency should always be the primary focus**. A good program and hard work are both important but they won’t do much for you if you quit.

The thing is, being consistent is hard. *Most people can’t do it.* Those who can reap all the rewards.

Whatever your goal, you must be consistent with the process (the set of habits that lead you to progress - more on this in Part 2).  If you’re just starting out, set the initial bar low. Don’t worry about the numbers, just focus on showing up and let time take care of the rest. You’re not special - it’s the same formula for everyone.

The mistake people make is wanting to be consistent with too much too quickly. This usually means that in the long run they burn out and return to old patterns of behaviour. Find a rate of progress that *you* can be consistent with as this will vary based on your prior experience.

If you’re not already in the habit of working out, you can’t expect to suddenly start hitting the gym five times a week.

If you’ve never bulked up before, you can’t expect to start eating an additional 500 calories every day and not get sick of it pretty quickly.

## 2. Patience

If you’re a beginner getting into the gym, you’re probably going to be weak for the first 3-6 months. If you’re a beginner getting into running, you’re probably going to be slow as hell. Who cares? In a year or two, the difference will be night and day.

Would you rather be impatient and not achieve your goal at all or take a slower approach and *actually* follow through?

Alongside consistency, you must cultivate a greater degree of patience. Focus on gradual, sustainable improvement and you’ll go pretty far. Focus on immediate results and you’ll probably get carried away - think injuries, think burnout.

It’s easy to get carried away when you’re making progress. When it feels like you’re racing in the right direction, it’s wise to recognise that you’ll probably at some point experience the other side of that coin. *Perhaps you don’t need to tick off all your fitness goals in the next three years but over a longer time frame instead.*

Impatience can obscure the bigger picture. Realise that as long as you’re showing up, you’re moving towards your goals and as long as you’re moving towards them, they are within reach. So make a commitment to yourself to stick with it; to take your time and to trust the process.

## 3. Recovery/Rest

When you’re committed to the long-haul, you don’t care about missing a day here and there. If you’ve been consistent in showing up and patient with your expectations, taking a day to rest when something feels off (or you just don’t feel like training) isn’t an issue - in fact, it’s probably a good thing.

Don’t let perfectionism cloud your judgement. As Tim Ferriss explains in *The 4-Hour Work Week*, *“Focus on great for a few things and good enough for the rest. Perfection is a good ideal and direction to have, but recognize it for what it is: an impossible destination.”*

Further, don’t buy into the idea that working hard means resting less - it’s the opposite. Pushing in one direction requires an equal push in the other. You can choose to consciously sustain this balance by taking the time to recover when needed, or you learn the hard way by getting injured. This is particularly important when you’re first starting out as your body isn’t acclimatised to the stress you’re suddenly putting it through.

More often than not, insufficient rest will lead to lower quality workouts which will then lead to less motivation on your part, less consistent effort, and ultimately, less results overall. Think long-term baby.

## 4. Quality Over Quantity

By lifting with your ego you’re doing your future self a disservice. Using bad form may get you a few more reps today, but usually at the cost of better results in the future. Those extra reps might make you feel like you’re killing it in the moment - but they could also lead to a week off as you take time to recover.

To reach our long term goals, we must place quality over quantity. Take pride in your ability to perform movements well. A clean set of pullups is more impressive than whatever they’re doing over in the CrossFit section. Again, you’re not above the process - using bad form will catch up with you, it’s a question of when it will happen, not if it will happen.

Realise that when you go on YouTube and see those guys making L-sit pull-ups [look effortless](https://youtu.be/j3MTqRWPiZU?t=124), it’s because they first learnt to do 1 with strict form. From there, 1 became 2, 2 became 3 and so on. They didn’t bad form their way to perfect technique.

## 5. Progressive Overload

Incremental progress. That’s the key to improving. Progressive overload is about gradually increasing the strain on your body so that it’s forced to adapt and come back stronger, faster etc.

For example, when it comes to lifting, we can do this in four main ways:

1. By increasing the weight on our lifts.
2. By increasing the number of reps or sets in our training.
3. By increasing the frequency that we train.
4. By performing exercises at a slower rate (i.e. greater time under tension).

*From comments* u/m092\*:\*

\- *Or at a faster rate for an entirely different adaptation focus.*

\- *Also increasing work density, e.g decreased rest times, or total sets/reps in a given time, or same reps/sets in less overall time, etc.*

&#x200B;

But if your goals lie outside of lifting (and some probably should for the sake of balance and longevity) the same concept applies - the general idea is to increase the workload (or stress) on your body.

To do this, find ways to challenge yourself ever so slightly. In turn, this will become a habit - you’ll always be looking for small ways to improve and it’ll show in the results you achieve.

EDIT 14/01/22:

I wrote a post a couple months back called ‘[We are the average of the content we consume](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/qz9aa6/advice_we_are_the_average_of_the_content_we/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)’. I strongly believe in this idea so I’ve created a subreddit around it - it’s called [r/OwnYourDay](https://www.reddit.com/r/OwnYourDay/).

The idea is to find and share useful and inspiring content/resources. These can be videos, books, articles or podcasts. In general, it’s for any content that changed your mindset or inspired you to take action."
Quarantine progress with recommended routine for 3~4 months,thatxforyou,1323,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i0pqil/quarantine_progress_with_recommended_routine_for/,1596128556.0,"**Stats**

23 years old/Male/1,67m height (equals aproximately 5 feet and 6 inches).

71.5 kilograms (157 pounds) before, now down to 63 kilograms (139 pounds) .

&#x200B;

**Background**

So, quarantine started around 4 months ago, and I was already getting too fat before of it. Because of that, and because of social distancing and stuff, I didn't want to go to gyms (even if they already have opened here), so I started researching about how to get somewhat healthier and bare minimum fitter at home with almost no equipment.

Then I found out this sub, and quickly started digging the recommended routine. I have already lifted some years back in the past (like when I was 16\~20) but I stopped after some time.

The reason I made this post is just to share my personal experience with the recommended routine for  around 3\~4 months. Im personally very happy with the results, even if it isn't a very impressive progress, I didn't thought I would have been disciplined for so far to be honest lol.

I want to really thanks this sub for creating a FAQ, routines and posts so well constructed, with precise and coherent informations. And I also want to thanks the active and well studied community that is always helping people with their questions. Everything here was really important for my progress so far.

&#x200B;

**Pictures**

Anyway, here is the link with the two pictures, first with 71.5 kg, and then (some days ago) with 63 kg.

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

Forgot to describe some needed info, sorry!

&#x200B;

**Diet:**

I stopped drinking sodas, juices altogether.  Started eating healthier and leaner food, like a lot of broccoli and cauliflower. I still enjoy fast food sometimes but it greatly less often. Also I eat a lot of chocolate still, it is the sweet food that I crave the most I think.

Also I fast for 12 hours everyday, so I think it is not called intermittent fasting yet. The reason I fast is because I read about how fasting can help stabilize the body's response to insulin, and a high insulin tolerance may contribute to fat gain.

But basically thats it, I didn't even count calories, I just wanted to get somewhat healthier and leaner than I was before, so I didn't really structure a diet... I just choose foods that are less caloric in general for my meals, generally, with less carbohydrates than before (but I still eat them, mostly in the form of fruits like bananas, oranges, grapes, raisins...)

I also drink Whey Protein powder for reaching that protein, around 100 grams daily for my weight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Exercises Routine:**

Essentially the recommended routine. Started with the most basic of each exercise, and progressed with it the way it was explained, 3 times a week (sometimes 2). My only alteration in the routine is the core training, that I reduced to only doing L-sit for now.

&#x200B;

Pseudo planche push-ups 3x8

Pull-up 3x8

Split-leg squat 3x8 (both legs obviously)

Split-leg romanian deadlift 3x8

Weighted Dips 3x8

Rows 3x10

L-sit for 30 seconds x 3 (doing it hanging at the pull-up bar for now)

ATHLEANX PERFECT Home Workout (Sets and Reps Included,None,1302,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fl9frj/athleanx_perfect_home_workout_sets_and_reps/,1584621921.0,"Here is the video:

And the description with the program included:

The PERFECT Home Workout

Home workouts can be a lifesaver, especially in times when you cannot get to the gym. In this video, I’m going to give you a complete home workout routine with all sets and reps included to help you to build muscle regardless of whether or not you ever step foot in a gym. The key to the effectiveness of this perfect home workout is that it pairs exercises together in a way that allows you to train to greater overload than would be possible if you stuck with one single exercise, and it will keep the workouts brief at the same time. This perfect home workout consists of not one but two complete total body workouts. The first, workout A, is to be performed on Monday and Friday of week 1. Workout B is to be performed on Wednesday. In week 2, this is flipped so that A is performed once on Wednesday and B is performed on both Monday and Friday. You can continue to alternate the workouts in this way if you decide to do this for longer. This workout for home is going to allow you to hit your total body in under one hour. With this being the goal, the idea is not to try and hit each muscle with too many individual exercises since this could lead to an excessively long workout and potential for doing too much in the given workout. Instead, we select the exercises based on movement patterns that we know we want to hit to accomplish our goal of building muscle everywhere. These patterns are broken down below and the exercises included in each are shown. Keep in mind, there are two complete versions of each workout to be sure that the beginners and more advanced trainees can follow this program and get results from it. Here is how to construct the perfect home total body workout 

A: 1. SQUAT / ANTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Alt. Single Leg Box Squats (use low box if advanced / higher box for beginners) 1 1/2 Bottomed Out Squats (to failure) Jump Squats 

2. UPPER PUSH (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Handstand Pushups OR Power Pushaways Rotational Pushups OR Knee Rotational Pushups Cobra Pushups (long head contracted) OR Knee Cobra Pushups 

3. HINGE / POSTERIOR (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Alt. Single Leg Heel Touch Squats (use “kickstand” if needed) Alt. Sprinter Lunges Plyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner) 

4. UPPER PULL (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Pullups OR Seated Pullups Human Pullovers OR BW Sliding Pulldowns Inverted Chin Curls 

5. ABS (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Reverse Corkscrews Black Widow Knee Slides Levitation Crunches 

6. CORRECTIVE (1 MINUTE PER EXERCISE / REST-PAUSE IF NEEDED) Angels and Devils COMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS (TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES) 



Here is how to construct the perfect home workout B: 

HINGE / POSTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg) Long Leg March High Hip Bucks 

LUNGE / ANTERIOR x 3 ROUNDS Alt. Crossover Step Ups Alt. Reverse Lunges Split Squat Jumps 

UPPER PUSH x 3 ROUNDS Variable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups to Knee Flat Pushups Alt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners) Tricep BW Extensions (long head stretch) 

UPPER PULL x 3 ROUNDS Chin Ups OR Seated Chin Ups Inverted Rows Back Widows 

ABS x 2 ROUNDS Ab Halos V-Up Tucks Sit-Up Elbow Thrusts 

CORRECTIVE x 2 ROUNDS Reverse Hypers COMPLETE 1-2 MORE ROUNDS 


(TOTAL WORKOUT TIME: 35-50 MINUTES) 



If you are doing this workout just to try it out, then I would suggest you choose the workout A variation. That said, if you opt to do a more comprehensive total body split workout routine then you will want to either incorporate workouts A and B into a twice a week plan or, even better, alternating A and B on M, W and F each week. For a complete 6 week home workout plan, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below to get the athlean xero program. No equipment at all is required. Build muscle at home in just 6 short weeks.

I attended my first adult gymnastics class. My thoughts,WojtekimbieR,1300,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/j168xf/i_attended_my_first_adult_gymnastics_class_my/,1601270652.0,"^(Please excuse my pathetic formatting on a mobile.)

My background: 

Like so many of you I'm an adult calisthenics / bodyweight enthusiast with some good strength but no gymnastics background. Over time I took an interest in men's artistic gymnastics sport events, incorporating gymnastic elements into my rings routine.

Today I went to a university gym to attend a 2-hour gymnastics class with 7 other adults, 4 men and 3 women, all regulars of 4+ months. These classes are meant to teach artistic gymnastics on apparatuses of still rings, parallel bars and the high bar. I personally have no interest in free exercises or acrobatics.

My observations:

1. The warmup was more intense thanks to running, crawling etc. ""compounded"" with upper body dynamic elements (compared to my half-assed mobility warmup standing). Just a reminder that you **do** need to do your wrist mobility, shoulder dislocates, arm circles etc. but it's also necessary to literally warm up (break a sweat).

2. We performed a multitude of lying, spotter-assisted, against the wall drills of bodylines, handstand and press elements that were not directly relevant to the work done later on the rings. Just a reminder that you have to do these things because they **will** come in handy at some point. ^(Don't be me who can't balance a freestanding HS more than 3 seconds unless the planets line up.)

3. Being finally able to swing on high rings as opposed to having them hang from a bar within arms reach is fun! It was a little intimidating to jump and grab them at first (280cm).

4. There is a shit-ton of short cues and tips that a professional will throw at you each time you perform **anything**. After 4 years of calisthenics I understood the terms we were told and did most things largely right within a couple repetitions ^(people assumed I had actual gymnastics background which is nice.) But the trainer's informed eye points out the little things and fixes that you weren't aware of, that noone has told you, that you never noticed. That can make the difference between getting something *okay* on the first attempt and largely right on the third.

5. There are many useful progressions and variants of exercises where a foam box, a gym ball, adjustable-height rings or a spotter come in inherently handy. Some elements you just **can't** effectively learn by yourself on a bar, with a set of rings and resistance bands. ^(But you'd be surprised by how many you can.)

6. Gymnastic swing, kip and roll element guides on youtube are pitifully lacking (beyond the very foundations). The videos are often short, or meant for trainers to show how to teach and spot effectively, not so much how to learn them. Having watched hours of gymnastic events I wanted to do at least some of the exercises I saw on screen. They often require not more power, but dynamic awareness and being taught complex technique. Here this kind of classes really shines.

7. The other participants, of whom the most ""fresh"" was training since June, were performing skills at the level I'd hoped to see–not at all easy for me, but neither intimidatingly advanced. Before, I was anxious of dragging the group down or needing much help to follow allong.  ^(This may be a reason for shy people like me not to go. Worry not folks)

My conclusions:

Self-training based off internet tutorials can get one quite far, especially strength-wise. It's at this point that attending classes at a gym under a professional can be most beneficial to progress further. Having him show what things to do, correct the way one does them, combined with the foundational understanding and strength, can result in a lot of improvement even after few sessions. Even if, like me, you can't afford to pay for regular visits long-term, I greatly encourage you to find similar classes in your area and give them a try.

Needless to say it was very fun and inspiring"
SQUEEZE YOUR ARMPIT!,yskin308,1305,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gv7x82/squeeze_your_armpit/,1591106688.0,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8m\_d-pj2Mk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8m_d-pj2Mk)

I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but this has to be one of the best tips I've ever seen for almost every exercise. Essentially, just squeeze your armpits together when you're doing your exercises. This tip seems pretty useless at first, but trust me just try it. I tried this with my planche leans and ring pushups today, and it was insane how much more stable and strong I felt."

Wanted to repost after getting some messages about physique questions and RR progressions from my last post so here we go again. 

Starting calisthenics was the best decision of my life. After years of injuring myself at the gym, I feel more capable and injuries don’t stop me from continuing to exercise (not without modifications of course).  i feel more confident in my body’s abilities and am moving better now than I have in my late 20’s early 30’s. The best feeling was this weekend while at EDC, gym bros would ask me how much i bench and I’d answer with a push-up progression. 

i’ve documented my progress from the past 3 years in other posts if you want to see the progression. 

current routine:
- RR 3x’s a week (with a bicep focus day, delt focus day, and leg focus day)
- progressions:
++ muscle up +10lbs/pistol squat +10lbs
++ dips +90lbs/nordic curl negatives
++ hspu wall assisted/front lever to straddle row 
++ weighted leg raises +25 lbs
- 1-2 days of walking (12/30/3 but usually 2.7 speed) 

diet: vegetarian 80/20 (clean:not so clean). i noticed a pretty significant change in body composition when i started eating a whole salad kit for dinner a couple nights a week and adding an additional protein supplement (either a 2x shakes or shake + protein oats). also taking creatine (10mg) 5-6x’s week. 

weight: first photo is 188; current weight 162.

# Why and how i started?

I was living alone in another state for a college that i didn't like that much. A lot of things happened and i decided to get back to my parents for a while this was middle 2018. Time has passed and at the begnning of 2019 i was living basically locked in my room depressed. My scedule was waking up, go to my pc, eat a lot of shit and then sleeping. I started to feel like a burden to my family and one day my mom caught me crying like a child and she got me to a psychologist who told me that exercising could do wonders for me. Monday next i week i woke at 5 am to run (mostly walking cause i was very unfit) and liked it, i did it for 2 weeks every day until i thought ""i'm already doing it why not trying to build some muscle?"". Then i started to look for home workouts on the youtube mostly in portuguese (my first langague) and i knew the basic like i should balance push with pulls and when i started i could do:

* 0 Push-ups
* 0 Pull-ups obviously
* Despite beign sedentary for years i could still squat all the way down with no problems (i could not touch my toes tho, not even close)

I thought i had no place to do pull-ups so i improvised a lot of pull exercises like doing rows with a towel and my feet cause every broomstick i tried just broke, did push-ups against the wall almost horizontal. I did a lot of things not following a exercising selection, i started with PPLPPL Rest but i was just picking exercises and doing 3/4 sets of 12 for 3/4 exercises.

3 to 4 weeks went by and i was really liking so i started to search things in english and of course i found THENX first cause every noob finds it first and i started doing their circuits following PPL 2 times a week but i was like ""how dafuq i'm supposed to complete 3 rounds of this as a beginner?"". And i followed it anyways but kept learning. For nutrition people always told me to eat a lot to gaing weight so i was eating everything i could but i cut almost all processed foods entirely.

# After 2 months

I was in love with calisthenics and all the amazing skills i could see on youtube. I started to feel a little better and maybe build some muscle but at this point eveything for me is gaining enought strenght to do the advanced skills. I found Calisthenic Movment, Dominik Sky, Artem Morozov and FitnessFAQs so i started learning about progressions, proper training schedule, strenght vs hypertrophy and all the good stuff. I gained weight but the more a i learned about nutrition too i started to know that i don't need that much so i started eating a little less, i never counted calories/macros from this moment i was just going with the flow of my mirror. I improvised a bar on a bathroom that nobodys uses with a bar and started doing negatives and dips with chairs. I live a small town (90k people) and we have just one park with bars here but i wasn't going simple out of shame for my appearance and weakness. June i got sick and needed to back off exercise completely for a week, my body got smaller cause water weight loss and i felt bad so i decided to cut the crap and once i'm able to start exercising again i'm going to the park. I meet people doing basic things there and it was awesome. June i got a pair of rings.

# Beginning of 2020

I did the basics for a long time to get the hang of it and by October 2019 i changed my PPL split for a Full Body 3x a week after reading Overcoming Gravity first edition. I was doing OAC progression, RTO Dips progression but without a real goal still, just doing hypertrophy stuff so i could work on streght better later. I have to say that exercising and chalistenics changed my life, i joined this community about 6 months ago i guess and it's been great. I'm in love with everything behind calisthenics and exercising in general. I got a lot more energy and thanks to this i found a job and a direction for my life (currently getting a PT degree). I was also using my college gym mostly for the lower body and weighted stuff (dips and pull-ups) since mid February (Full Body 3x) but got closed 3 weeks ago. When i started weighted stuff i could started at 4x4 +20kg (45lbs) Pull-ups (+1/3 of my BW) and Dips +28 KG (61lbs) (+46% of my BW). Started Barbell Back Squat with +70kg (154lbs) (30Kg each side plus 10kg bar) for 5x5. My focus was to gather more strenght for Front Lever and to start planche training.

# During this quarantine

I was at 63 kg and that's the haviest i have been. I was tired of full body since i'm basically locked at home and with full body i just traing strenght stuff 3/4 times a week so i took a week deload at the start of quarantine and decided to cut a little fat and move to a PPL 2x times a week again but with a tweak. Right now i'm 60kgs and my training schedule is (i'm not going to include reps/sets and the progression scheme):

I achieved my first proper pull-up today!!,arch10,1293,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ivbhlg/i_achieved_my_first_proper_pullup_today/,1600453220.0,"After starting from absolute scratch 6 months ago, with barely any muscle mass, I was finally able to do a good pull-up today 

My question is, where do I go from here? I’ve been doing full body splits for the last few months and don’t know how to go further now. Should I switch to a push pull leg routine, or some other split? 

Any advice will be appreciated, I want to continue my home workout streak, esp after having invested in a kettlebell recently"
Would anyone be interested in a workout generator app?,sirtimothy3,1284,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/s1cdm2/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_workout_generator/,1641906074.0,"Context: I'm a professional Software Engineer who likes working out (and really likes callisthenics/bodyweight training) and want to make something for myself. Just want to see if anyone else would be interested in it

A while ago, I came up with the idea for an app that would generate a random workout based on a series of parameters (equipment owned, ability level, duration of workout etc).This was when I was between programs but still wanted to work out, but wasn't sure what to do for the workouts.

The way I'd see it is like this

1. Enter the parameters needed (equipment, ability, muscles to work etc)
2. Press a button
3. Have a workout ready to do that is tailored to your requirements

Simple as that. Now obviously this isn't designed to replace a dedicated workout program, but is rather for the times when you want to workout but don't know what to do. Eg, in between programs

I was planning on making this for myself and just using exercises I know and love, but if people were interested I could expand it out a bit.

I'm planning on building a super simple prototype over the next month or so so let me know if you'd be interested in something like this/have any ideas for it!

&#x200B;

Edit: Well this blew up a little bit. Thank you for all the feedback and offers of help! It's super useful for me. I started work on the prototype last night so should have something working in a couple weeks. Drop me a message if you want to see/test the super early versions of this and I'll post here about it again once there's something that looks decent"

I seem to feel most ab exercises I try (except planks) in my lower back rather than in my abs.

Usually I feel the burn in my abs for a bit before my lower back takes over and I stop. I've heard this could be because I'm hip flexor dominant or because my core is just too weak so that my back takes over.

Has anyone experienced and overcome this?"

This post will detail my 3 year fitness journey, and hopefully give any beginners a realistic idea of what to expect :)


[Physique transformation, currently 78kg](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPWNRC6j-FM/?utm_medium=copy_link). I’ve gained about 10-12kg of lean muscle in these 3 years.


My lifts are:

* Bench: 100kg

* Squat: 120kg

* Deadlift: 150kg

* Pull up: bodyweight + 60kg


My skills unlocked include:

* Full front lever

* Slow muscle up for reps

* One arm pull ups for reps

* Handstand for ~20 seconds 

* *nearly* a handstand pushup

My first year was spent mainly cutting weight. Starting at 93kg I cut down to 67kg by harshly restricting calories. I went FAR too hard, and although I saw good results I ended up getting injured, stalling my progress. I cut at around a 1250 calorie deficit, causing me to feel extremely lethargic 24/7. In future cuts i kept this number to 500 at MOST. The first year was spent exclusively weight lifting on a PPL routine 6 days a week. I saw some good results but I eventually realised my routine wasn’t structured enough and I needed a proper routine.


My second year was spent mainly rock climbing, and training for rock climbing. I recommend this sport to EVERYONE! The community is great, the sport is fun and great exercise, and it makes you REALLY want to train to get strong AF in the gym to push your grade. During this year my back seriously exploded in size to the point where it was almost disproportionate. I unlocked the full front lever and got my first one arm pull ups and explosive muscle ups.


My most recent year has been spent in a lockdown... causing me to transition to gymnastics rings and other calisthenics elements. I followed [this](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/bodyweighttribe.com/gym-rings-workout/amp/) routine and saw excellent results, especially in my shoulders and chest which quickly grew to back my back in size.


**What I’ve learned**

* You should get on a structured routine ASAP!! Don’t just mess around. I’ve seen better gains in this last year than I did when I was in my newbie stage.

* Do what you enjoy. The best workout routine (contrary to the above statement) is the one you can stick to, which will be one you enjoy. For me, that’s calisthenics and rock climbing.

* Sort your diet out, it’s an enormous factor in growth.

* Dont beat yourself up for eating too much/little or or missing a workout, as long as you’re consistent over a long period the gains will come!"

My friend and I have made a Recommended Routine app. It helps us to stay focused during the workout and track our progress. We are sharing it with everyone for free.

Long Story

A couple of years ago I saw a couple of calisthenics videos and fell in love with the Human Flag. I had no idea how to even approach this beast but since I was a programmer I knew how to solve my problems by googling and following advice from strangers on the internet word by word. This is how I found this subreddit and RR. A friend agreed to join me and we started working out together.

Previously I've tried to sustain gym several times but with, lets say, less than commendable results. With RR everything clicked right away - the focus on technique and the ability to progress to new levels kept our motivation high for sufficient amount of time as to become a part of life. The only thing that was missing for us was the ability to track our progress through the workout and through the workouts. We tried several ways, none worked. So we decided to use our programming skills to help ourselves. And since we were good programmers we quickly created an ugly malfuncioning piece of software that still worked and made a huge difference for us.

In the meantime I approached my Human Flag, boasted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fzyj11/how_recommended_routine_and_antranik_guide_took/) and began moving to Freestanding HeSPU.

Since the app was so useful to us and so fun to make, we decided give back to the community by quickly polishing it and share it with you guys. And since we are great engineers, polishing the app took at least four times as long as releasing the working version of it. We believe now its good enough to not cause to much frustration to the users. Please try it. We really want it to become an app that Recommended Routine deserves. We can only do it with your feedback.

Before/After of What's Possible with 3.5 Months of an ALMOST Exclusively Bodyweight Routine,matthewjameswho,1275,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hsg9op/beforeafter_of_whats_possible_with_35_months_of/,1594927135.0,"**Hello fam.** I just wanted to show everyone on this sub what's definitely possible with a bodyweight routine. I've been told by people that I have a body type that's conducive to building muscle fast, but they also don't know that I've never gone more than 6 months of my adult life without training. So, maybe this isn't possible for everyone - maybe I really do have a body type that makes it easier - but this is all I have to go off of!

&nbsp;
 

**Context:** I hadn't worked out consistently for more than a month or two in about a year. I have a job that I travel a lot for. We were in Europe for a few months at the end of 2019. I came back from Italy through NYC in mid-December. I got really sick. Tested negative for the flu. I'm not saying it was covid, but it was covid. So after that, my diet resumed to being as shitty as possible and I hit the gym for about a month or a month and a half... and then the lockdown started, and thus, our story begins.

&nbsp;
 

**Time Frame:** March to early June. Maybe a little before March actually. Let's call it mid-February to early June. So about 3.5 months.

**Pics after being sick:** https://imgur.com/gallery/55ScWeD
 
&nbsp;

**Starting Stats:**

* Male
* 30 Years Old
* 150lbs
* 5 foot 9 inches of pure SEX
* Pretty swell kinda guy

**Ending Stats:**

* Male
* 30 years old
* 145lbs
* 5 foot 9 inches of bulging, borderline grotesque musculature 
* 13.6% Bodyfat (according to the machine at my new gym)
* Small children and old women now cross the street to avoid me when they see me coming. It's pretty awesome. 
* Still pretty goddamn swell

&nbsp;

**Diet:** So bad you wouldn't believe it. I'm talkin' fast food 1+ times a day. I'm talkin' never hitting my macro goals. For the last 3-4 weeks of training I finally got my diet in order. I meal planned, prepped, and was feeling amazing. I would still eat out with my friends and drink sometimes. THEN I went on tour for work and the diet went out the window.

 &nbsp;

**Exercise:** From mid-January to mid-February I got back in the gym. I was feeling ok about it, but still forcing myself to go most days. Then the lockdown hit. My roommate and I decided to make a little (tiny) home gym and work on a bodyweight routine until gyms opened back up. After that, we recruited more friends and worked out at the park almost daily. It was pretty rad to have a group of 4-7 homies working out in the famously mild Texas sun.

**Pics after that gym stint directly BEFORE the bodyweight routine began:** https://imgur.com/gallery/TaeIJbP
 
&nbsp;

**Here's BASICALLY my routine from March to early June:**

* 6 days a week rarely missing a day

* M - Upper / Tu - Lower / W - Core / Th - Upper / F - Lower / Sa - Core / Su - Rest  

**Upper:**

* *Push-Ups* w/ Perfect Push-up Handles - 3x8 --> 3x15 (would sometimes mix in diamonds, declines, and claps)
* *Inverted Row* - 3x8 --> 3x15 (these dropped off for the most part when we started going to the park because I couldn't find a place to do them)
* *Pull Ups* - 3x6 --> 3x12 (usually failed around 6-8 reps on the last set. Never got a full third set.)
* *Handstand Practice* - 3x30 seconds --> 3x60 seconds (shocked at how much muscle definition handstands give your shoulders)
* *Chest Dips* - 3x8 --> 3x12 (only added these the last couple of weeks of the routine
* *Supplemental* - would more often than not do some lateral raises, overhead presses, curls, and rows with resistance bands.

**Lower:**

* Whatever we felt like that day. Variations of squats, deadlifts, calf raises, and other fun stuff.

**Core:**

* bicycles, dead bugs, butt ups, heel touches, glute bridges, hollow hold, reverse plank, side plank x 2, elbow plank, superman, bird dog, leg raises
* Sometimes we would do a 10 minute HIIT from the tube of yous

**Cardio:**

* The last few weeks I would jog 1-2 miles a day
* Walk 1-2 miles a day

**Stretching/Mobility/Stabilizers:**

* Most mornings, I did (and do) a mobility routine based on molding mobility
* Did some yoga and a stretching routine at night
* Sometimes hit my rotator cuffs and rear delts with the bands

**Supplements:**

* Creatine
* Citrulline Malate
* Protein

&nbsp;

**Lessons learned:** I fucking love bodyweight stuff. There's something about it that's so natural and impressive to me. It connects you to your body in a way that weightlifting doesn't. I'd much rather be able to do handstand push ups, flags, one-armed pull-ups, etc., than be able to squat 400lbs. I didn't even realize the progress I made was possible with a bodyweight routine. Not only that, I FELT amazing. With weightlifting, I feel like I'm always on the brink of injury (which is kind of fun in itself - to have to focus so hard on each rep to make sure you have perfect form). With a bodyweight routine I felt like a ninja master. Idk, it's hard to explain, but there's something really hella dope about bodyweight stuff. I think diet and cardio were the most beneficial things, and mobility + flexibility is key. 

 &nbsp;

**What's next:** So at the end of this little sexcapade, I went on tour for about a month and was only able to work out intermittently. I lost a bit of muscle defintion and put on a bit of fat, but I still feel primed for prime time, BABY!! I'm on day 4 of being back in an iron sanctuary. I'm so sore I'm questioning existence. It's amazing. The pump I get from iron is like cumming. I'm always cumming. Cumming in the gym, cumming at home, cumming backstage. I'm just always cumming (please get the reference so it's not just me talking about cumming). I'm doing a routine by that lovely little piece of sexy Canadian manmeat Jeff Nippard. Continuing to work on building mindfulness, good habits, and a better diet! I doubt the music industry will be having tours or open venues any time soon, so I'm going to continue to become 69 inches of pure, unfiltered FUCK. I'm going to become so thick, tight, and juicy... you have no idea. Not really, I just want to be healthy of mind, body, and emotions.

* chest flyes on rings or [sliding on the floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF2l3oV-Q3w).

**Lats:**

* front lever straight arm pulls, can be even done on [one arm](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhUHDUNFBKn/?taken-by=emanuele_majeli97)
* [floor](https://youtu.be/DyoUqDzpVko?t=1m37s) or ring pullovers, hardest would be one arm on the feet.

**Front deltoids:**

* imitating front deltoid raises with rings
* press to handstand and planche press (but it is mostly a full body exercise).
* [inverted cross press to handstand](https://youtu.be/YzJh0DdQZZg?t=14s) and inverted hang to handstand (reverse butterfly mount), best I've seen is a [pulley assisted one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwW5IEV8tCE). Update: a Russian gymnast had done a freestanding inverted butterfly negative, you can see a reversed version of that clip to get an idea of how the concentric would look like, [here](https://vk.com/video1973023_170386385). If the link does not work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yElLMbilg0g) is a reupload.


**Side deltoids:** 

* stab the elbow capoeira pushups ([easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vCTNTSNOto), [harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24syRZMgWMI))
* wide handstand pushups
* doing a sort of [planche lean from a forearm side plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfNrWMWmBTI), possibly dynamically with something smooth that helps sliding.
* if someone did a straight arm raise from inverted hang to inverted cross with a supinated grip it would sort of be an upside down side delt raise, but even a supported version would be very hard. New: [partial attempt](https://youtu.be/W8FJD62RwSc?t=39)

**Rear deltoids:**  

* rear deltoid flyes 
* [wide front lever rows (at 1:47 even wider)](https://youtu.be/LX2pXSP5pS4?t=89)
* reverse planche and [Manna](https://youtu.be/Kpud4FWX6XQ?t=1m18s) and dragon press stuff.

**Upper traps:**

* handstand and inverted hang shrugs, potentially on one arm.

**Mid/low traps and rhomboids:**

* front lever shrugs
* one arm row shrugs.

**Rotator cuff:** 

* [suspended external rotations](https://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/STShoulderExternalRotation), something similar can be done for internal rotation.

**Compound legs:**

* single leg squats (pistol, shrimp, [deep step ups](https://instagram.com/p/1jdRZorwdE))
* single leg Romanian deadlifts
* single leg hip thrusts.
* [natural one leg press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5p1FVxOHX8) the only long term challenging exercise if you use a high friction surface (the material in the video feels like a pistol squats with +75% bodyweight added, according to the guy in the clip), the other ones only stay challenging with added weight. If you don't use the stretch reflex or pause at the bottom it's harder because you also have to overcome static friction. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZXABJh3dA0) is a dead stop repetition from the bottom, and [deficit version](https://youtu.be/_VEewYqn_SQ?t=3m49s).


**Quads:**

* [elevated two hand shrimp squats](https://youtu.be/52qFFMdlPFA?t=22s), [another demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aExVWmYiBl4)
* freestanding sissy squats ([super deep](https://youtu.be/uvm1GThWnPA?t=2m41s))
* [wall assisted one leg sissy squat](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=8m10s) (partial ROM)
* [friction resisted sissy squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkDenuQftw), a rougher surface makes it harder than the freestanding surface, no footage of full ROM one leg yet
* [vertical shin leg extensions, straight body and back touching the floor (Matrix squats)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIBfpwvq5SA)
* [assisted single leg Matrix squats, not full ROM](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYud8bJAQlA/).
* [maximum deficit Matrix squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY7GhsnLRmg), by extending the arms overhead it would be even harder.
* [one leg Matrix squat to parallel](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=8m48s)
* [partial one leg sissy squat](https://youtu.be/p2BjeaMX4kg?t=2m2s)
* [horizontal shin leg extensions with straight body and momentum](https://youtu.be/1egn6D4T82E?t=18s), [raises and holds with less space available](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=6m26s). Also known as leg extension lever, [one leg version with bent body](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=9m18s)
* [assisted kneeling single leg extension](https://youtu.be/6JpV0NPQ9s4?t=35s) with a low bar helping with balance and some strength.
* [real natural one leg extension!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghrEClu180M). The hardest quad element currently unlocked.
* Single leg variations of some of those potentially, or super deep. Hypothetical illustrations of [kneeling and sissy](https://i.imgur.com/1AsSwNo.jpg), [Matrix squats](https://i.imgur.com/m9tJJoQ.jpg), [horizontal shin on park bench with strap](https://i.imgur.com/4qm8a9c.jpg)
* At the end of [this clip](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkmxRktl7nm/) you can see a real one leg Matrix squat to parallel, after other hard leg exercises. 

**Hamstrings:** 

* single leg sliding or [suspended hamstring curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4-9l57Y-28)
* [inversion boots leg curls](https://youtu.be/_nqnIlZfm-Q?t=10s) and [one leg partial range](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=9m43s)
* [Nordic curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RBAstMjbNU) and even single leg if you are not human (best I've seen is [crossed legs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbCAT6fjQ5b/?taken-by=matteodeu)) 
* [inversion boots Nordic curls on stall bars](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=10m1s), partial ROM
* [single leg Nordic curl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-gkNGuEFOw) with some kip and hip bend but the hardest variation recorded so far. new: [better form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7YF0xejtt4&t=0s) (no kip but still some bounce and arch)
* The hardest would be decline single leg, [hypothetical illustration](https://i.imgur.com/t7Sx7vb.jpg)


**Glutes:**

* The hardest compound exercise that challenges them is the natural one leg press. 
* Single leg hip thrusts with shoulders and feet elevated are the hardest unweighted isolation variation but take only intermediate strength without added weight.
* Maybe tying a strap to a wooden board, putting your back and feet on that board and doing an isometric glute bridge against that strap. Or attaching the strap to a fixed bench, or to a pole and doing a standing hip thrust.

**Calves:** 

* single leg calf raises or calf jumps, standing for the gastrocnemius and at the bottom of a squat for the soleus. 
* In hamstring curls the gastrocnemius is also used, if you try Nordic curls with the strap or immovable object on your sole instead of the heel, you will probably get huge calf cramps.

**Adductors:**

* unsupported side splits and some [adductor isolation stuff](https://youtu.be/Rm4etEeE9Cg?t=4s).

**Abductors:**

* [side leg raises](https://youtu.be/Rm4etEeE9Cg?t=52s).

**Abs and hip flexors:** 

* used in many exercises with other muscles. 
* One arm versions increase the load on the obliques to resist rotation, but also the load on the upper body
* Ab wheel ([one arm one leg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nTrYe7NBv4))
* L-sit ([fully compressed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BamK6eoKZ_Y))
* dragon flags ([decline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjkI-8MproA))
* leg raises (toes to bar if possible, can be done [one arm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1hOORYzeyA))
* [inverted situps](https://youtu.be/-Dk_dk2mP88?t=32s)
* [leg raise to fully piked front lever](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfOW7vEHtjA/?taken-by=dominik_sky)
* isometrically in front lever and Victorian and reverse planche. 
* Obliques in human flag but it also has a big upper body strength requirement.

**Spinal erectors:**

* reverse hyperextensions, the upper body support can be reduced until only the chest is supported, [the reverse dragon flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnoRbBuui20) is the exercise with maximum spinal erector challenge that has the lowest upper body strength requirement
* [back lever leg lifts](https://youtu.be/jKXicOT7aYg?t=45s), same spinal erector challenge but harder for the upper body
* [reverse dragon press](https://i.imgur.com/wiuU82R.png), even harder on the upper body
* [another reverse dragon press variation](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfd5_A0Fiil/?taken-by=nrnscalisthenics). The upper body is the limiting factor.
* [the yoga locust pose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCiSRVRHBSk) requires a strong spinal extension active mobility
* Isometrically used in planche, back lever, Maltese. Also used in press handstands but not the limiting factor.
* Putting a strap under your feet and pulling it with your hands to simulate an isometric deadlift, or with your upper back like in a good morning.

**Forearms (and finger tendons):** 

* [fingertip hangs, wrist flexions and extensions agaist a wall, bar or floor](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4H8S7PgLVwg), for the wrist moves keeping the arms straight and pushing closer to the fingertips increases the lever arm, and the maximum load would be during a one arm handstand (against a wall is more practical to eliminate the balance requirement), if you ever needed an insane amount of resistance
* false grip (one arm) for wrist flexors
* [reverse false grip](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcCyAA_jPkj/?taken-by=roye_gold) for wrist extensors
* hand balancing
* hanging/pulling on one arm or some fingers
* doing pushing stuff on wrists or [fingertips](https://youtu.be/7LkhVeW7VV0?t=12s) 
* [wrist pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU5UCh_E6Ns).

**Neck:** 

* neck bridge and plank variations (safety is controversial, especially for the bridges, at least in the plank you can keep a neutral spine and scale the body incline but both are risky, [here is a video about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjiZaCJ6tCA), neck curls curls are safe instead).
* [Jesus neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW_TZPxzOTc) and [iron neck](https://youtu.be/BRG4iHBj3EU?t=7m19s)
* Head balancing, less support from hands increases the neck effort (and risk), [no hands](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhbRStGHayh/?taken-by=charliem2) is the hardest, straight body would be harder since there is a longer lever arm to oppose when adjusting balance, [straight body assisted with donut/bagel](https://youtu.be/xC7Yg3kpGWI?t=28s) 

**Pelvic floor:** 

* kegels, since someone requested that I add cock pushups here.

**Any muscle:**

* You can do immovable resistance overcoming isometrics for pretty much any muscle at any angle, example with [squats](https://i.imgur.com/Z0l0wXk.jpg), the problem is that isometrics carry over to a small joint angle around the trained position so you'd have to do holds at multiple angles.

Yes, I am a bit nuts since I spend all that time writing comments like this one.

"I'm an absolute beginner, and I made a new Recommended Routine cheat sheet that includes form tips. It's helpful for me so far, and maybe you too?",sepiaeleganss,1258,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/401gte/im_an_absolute_beginner_and_i_made_a_new/,1452266078.0,"I had been thinking about joining a gym for a while, but hadn't because of many reasons, one of which being that I didn't know what I should do there. So I started researching, came across this sub a few days ago, and decided instead to commit to doing the Recommended Routine in my basement. I have a floor, wall, chairs, table, and closet bar to make it work, and it's awesome that's all I need for now.

However, I live in a rural area with terrible phone/data service, I don't even have a phone new enough to use the app, and I don't have internet access in my house. I read and watched what I could earlier in the day, went home, got confused doing the warmup, and half-assed the strength work a little bit before deciding I had no real idea what I was doing. I needed a printable way to remind myself how to do the exercises in the routine with proper form without watching videos or loading websites as I went.

So I compiled a lot of stuff I read and saw on here into [this PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwYajVlzpnYaUURONE5obkhjdVU/view?usp=sharing). I'm sharing in case anyone else finds this helpful. I've done the routine once since making this yesterday, and it gave me enough form cues to make it through without totally doubting (and more importantly, hurting) myself!

Please let me know if you spot any typos/incorrect info. Also, you may notice that I didn't include the full Pushup and Row progressions - frankly, this is because I decided enough was enough, and once a beginner gets to those levels they probably don't need this cheat sheet any more!

**Edit: Updated PDF to fix typos and include full third pair progressions, same link above**"

I was already doin normal barbell training before for at least 2 years but rather inconsistent.

I could only perform 1-2 pull-ups and now I'm able gut get 3x8! Same goes for pushups and now I'm doin 3x7 ring pushups. But my biggest achievement are 3x6-7ish HSPU's.
Edit 2: because many people asked, I counted calories in the beginning and did a low carb diet for about 6 weeks then slowly started adding carbs again. I cut out all sugar completely. But doin what works for you best should always be the best choice.  There is no perfect diet for everybody in my opinion.

Thanks to everybody that's active in here and helping others out.

I hope I can motivate some people to keep on goin!"

This is so bad and gives so much wrong information that I had to make this post. I know many people in this sub are beginners, I think it would help them.

So in this video he says how amazing HSPU is for building shoulders (read Bruce Wayne shoulders) and that is true, there is nothing wrong with that. But then he makes several mistakes.

First he shows the pike push up form which is just wrong. He keeps his arms wide and flares out his elbows. This is the wrong way. Your elbows should never flare out, it should always be tucked in. This is very important for your shoulder health.

He does the same thing with raised pike push ups and even wall assisted HSPU. And he does the wall assisted HSPU with his back to wall not belly to wall which is the proper way to progress.

His back is arching like hell, this is also not the right way. Keep your body in a straight line.

Also he mentions several times in the video that wall assisted HSPU is the most elite bodyweight shoulder exercise which is laughable. If a wall assisted banana back elbow flared out back to wall HSPU is elite then I should be in the Olympics.

For those wondering, 90° push ups, ring freestanding HSPU, clapping HSPU, Tiger Bend are usually considered to be advanced. And Japanese HSPU, archer HSPU, deep elevator on a straight bar (palm facing you), impossible HSPU, Simonster HSPU are usually considered elite. His version is a progression towards these (though poorly executed) and is considered late novice to intermediate.

I'm not hating on him. I have nothing against him. He has a godlike body. I'd fuck him anyday. But his information is wrong and can get you injured. Dominik Sky, FitnessFAQs, Artem Morozov, Sid Paulson, LittleBeastM, CalisthenicsMovement, Simonster are the people who gives quality information and are strong as fuck. Take information from them."

Started the RR at the end of May. It was humbling to start with banded pull downs esp after being a gym rat in college. But then I got dumped in June and was sidelined after a car accident in October but i pushed through and am more inspired than ever! Shouts to meditation, PT, and therapy! If you’re thinking about making a change, just start! Even if it’s something soooo small, just collect those wins baby! 

Currently no planned cardio. Twice daily 15 min longboarding sessions with my dog and challenging 5-10 mile hikes on the weekends. I also try to get yoga with Adrienne in at least once a week and have a 30 mobility regiment that I do 3x’s a week (should be daily 🤫). 

Diet: I went vegetarian at the End of 2019 after watching the game changers doc. My family has a crazy history with heart problems so this was always something I wanted to do. Any day I didn’t eat meat was a win for me. Didn’t track macros, only wanted to get away from animal products. Eating about 2100 cals with protein shakes + creatine 3-4x’s week. 

Here’s my 2020 workout. 3 sets of the following w/36lb weighted vest:
- ring pull ups(6-8x)
- squats (50lb dumbell x 12)
- ring dips (8x)
- deadlifts (50lb dumbell x12)
- ring rows w/elevated feet (7-8x)
- ring push ups 1-legged (12x)
- bicycle (70x) 
- butterfly crunch slow (10x)

I clearly need to cut and shift my macros to more protein if I want to break past these baby gainz. Any pointers based on my body composition? I want to start working on filling/widening my chest by using a push-up circuit at the end of my sessions. Perhaps there’s a better way? Would love to fill in my peashooters too.

I'm a computer science student (and also an avid calisthenics hobbyist) who has followed this community for a couple of years.

I've really enjoyed exploring the different calisthenics apps available; but I see a lot potential improvements. That is, it would be nice to be able to customise and map out your own progression paths, form different routines, and track progress in them, instead of having to download an app for each particular routine (that inevitably changes over time).

** Update **
A lot came up within our team unfortunately. 2 of us have a startup taking off and requiring a lot of time, and I landed an internship for this summer. We found that due to these reasons along with finding some existing apps which provide a lot of our desired functionality, we are putting this project on hold for the mean time. 

We will be looking to start it up again at some point in the future once we aren't all so busy; but for now our priorities had to take a turn... Sorry for the unfortunate news! If you have any questions/comments or still have suggestions for an app let us know. On a lighter note, I'll be in San Fransisco for an internship soon, and I'd love to meet up with anyone who is interested in training together! Send me a PM if interested.

But for a normal working person how much of that is possible? And really how much effort is really needed?

"I put together a big guide to mobility, with 100+ exercises from head toe and 'recipes' for specific restrictions & postural issues. Hope you enjoy!",HealthRoom,1240,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/68ulp2/i_put_together_a_big_guide_to_mobility_with_100/,1493746566.0,"What's up people!

So - last week I finished putting together an 'ultimate guide' to mobility exercises. 

'Tis something I've been working on for a quite while, with the somewhat audacious title of:

**[All The Mobility Exercises You’ll Ever Need \(100+ From Head to Toe\)
](http://herohealthroom.com/2017/04/27/mobility-exercises/)**

---

Essentially, the guide contains an intro to mobility (benefits, methods etc), followed by a list from head to toe of exercises, and then finally some mobility 'recipes' for addressing specific restrictions or improving certain positions (that section is a work in progress).

**In the main body, I've included myofascial techniques, mobilizations, and articulations for the:**

* Head, Jaw & Neck
* Shoulders
* Thoracic
* Elbows, Wrists & Hands
* Lower Back & Core
* Hips
* Knees, Ankles & Feet

All can be performed with no little to no equipment, or with stuff that doesn't cost a fortune to pick up.

You'll see quite a few familiar faces throughout, including a load of links to u/antranik, u/MovementTom, u/EmmetLouis, u/rocksupreme and the rest of GMB, Kit, Ido, and a bunch of Kelly Starrett's work too.

---

The guide is largely inspired by the awesome Mobility Project u/antranik put together a while back ([link here if you haven't seen it](http://antranik.org/the-mobility-project/)), but instead, *this is split into specific areas/joints of the body.*  

So if you're particularly looking to improve your wrist mobility, free your hips or fix those rounded shoulders, all you have to do is go ahead and open the relevant section and you'll find a bunch of relevant videos that *hopefully* should help you out. 

**Important to keep in mind that if you have a certain restriction or mobility issue, also look upstream and downstream of the problem area (e.g a knee issue might be the result of tight ankles or a dodgy hip).**

&#x200B;

For anyone who is into fitness in any way at all, whether you are a professional athlete, a weekend warrior, bodybuilder or martial artist or whatever else, I cannot more highly recommend Jeff. I discovered his channel 5+ years ago now, and I recommend that any and everyone checks it out. 

&#x200B;

He is a physical therapist/personal trainer and he has hours and hours of information he has put out for free. He is extremely knowledgeable and he teaches in a very visual, accessible, easy to understand way. Some of it is significant changes to form and exercise, some of it is little details and nuances for those minute improvements that make big differences.

&#x200B;

The channel name is AthleanX, go check it out when you have a minute, there is something for everybody at every stage of fitness and health."

Decided to make a more thorough walkthrough for the push-up after seeing too many push-ups with sketchy form in formchecks on the discord chan (discord.org/BWF).

The main message behind this tutorial, if I could only say one thing, is get rid of your fuckin ego when it comes to 'basic' exercises. If you can drill it perfectly, then when you progress to harder movements, it'll be a breeze because you have a strong foundation. Too many people I see just want to progress through the RR like its a videogame and you're trying to speedrun it. Fitness isn't a race. You can do it hastily out of a desire to look cool to other people, or you can do it in an intentional, considered way if you want to BE cool

Anyway here it is!

#The Push-up
The pushup is one of the fundamental, basic upper body exercises you will learn in calisthenics/bodyweight exercise.

For the very reason that the push-up is a fundamental movement, it is imperative that you have it perfected, to ensure every progression you build on from there is not plagued by form fault. As a result, this guide will act as my best attempt to cover everything I know about the push-up in as much detail as possible. If I've done my job right, no one could ask me a single question about push-ups that aren't already answered in this resource

#How to do a Standard Push-up
Here is a demonstration of a good form, standard push-up.

https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/impassionedaggressivecatfish

Now we will break it down from head to toe to explain what makes it good:

##Start Position:

https://i2.wp.com/www.nick-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/31890769_1955741677832330_5108785795259432960_n.jpg

*(1) Head Position:* Chin tucked, neck neutral. Not sticking out like a chicken, or looking ahead.

*(2) Shoulder Position:* Extend upper back, push shoulders down and slightly protract (push into the ground)

*(3) Hand/Arm Position:* Hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart, with fingers spread, middle fingers parallel to each other. Hands directly under your shoulders

*(4) Torso Position:*  Ribs tightened down onto body, proper brace.

*(5) Pelvic Position:* Pelvis tucked so lower back is flat

*(6) Leg Position:* Legs straight, in line with torso (not piked)

*(7) Foot Position:* Toes tucked under, foot flexed. (N.B. Push-ups can also be done with the backs of the foot on the floor, with toes pointed, but this makes it much harder and I recommend learning this basic form first before experimenting with a toe point.)

This start position is a 'straight arm plank' which has a separate tutorial here, or a video here, but the basic points of both are summarised above.

##Movement:

https://gfycat.com/SafeAdvancedDorado

*(1) Radial Shoulder Movement:* As you can see, if you stuck a marker on the shoulder, it would draw a trace like a quarter of a circle, because the upper arm is rotating around the elbow, which is fixed.

*(2) Vertical Forearm:* This will come with point 1. If you are leading the movement with the shoulder, your forearm will not drift back. If it does, it puts more force on the elbow (which your elbow will not like once you start loading weight onto it). This, along with point 1, will make sure your thumbs are in line with the bottom of your chest at the bottom.

*(3) Ankle Rock:* This is what allows you to lead the movement with your shoulder without breaking bodyline. As you come down, point your toes a bit, it will send your body forward.

##End Position:

https://i1.wp.com/www.nick-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/31842010_1955742214498943_6156710012497428480_n-e1525461528820.jpg

*(1) Bodyline:* Butt should not be sticking up. Nice straight line from head to heel.

*(2) Shoulder Position:* Shoulders pushed down and pinched together like you're trying to hold a penny between your shoulder blades. Down AND pinched is the key. Don't let your shoulders shrug up in order to pinch them. (If they do, reference the 'Shoulder caving' compensation mentioned below)

*(3) Depth:* Chest to ground.

#Common Compensations:
Here are some very common ways that people lose position in the push-up, due to lack of technique, or due to weakness and trying to do a progression that is too hard for them.

#Body-roll Push-up:

https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/impeccablerectangularhapuku

*Why does this happen?*

You aren't strong enough for the push-up progression you are currently doing, so you are compensating to make the movement easier.

You are not engaging your abs so the movement is coming from the 'path of least resistance', which is extending at the spine to reduce the leverage on your arms.

Drills to help fix:

* More practice

* Work on bracing strength with dead bugs

* Apply the brace to the plank

* Work on an easier progression until you can keep the brace all the way through the movement

#Chicken Necking Push-up

https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/OfficialTameCougar

*Why does this happen?*

You are subconsciously trying to limit the ROM because the progression are you doing is too hard. You are using the cue 'nose to ground' so if you extend your neck, your nose touches the ground sooner in the movement.

Drills to help fix:

* Stop using 'nose to ground', use 'chest to ground'

* Do an easier progression that you can complete the full ROM of without chicken necking

* Over-exaggerate a tucked 'double chin' position for a while until you get used to the movement, then move to a neutral neck

#Booty Push-up

https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/saferectangulargourami

*Why does this happen?*

You haven't learned how to extend at the hip in the pushup, or the bottom of the pushup is too hard for you, so you lift your hips to limit the range of motion subconsciously.

Drills to help fix:

* Bottom push-up holds

* Film yourself doing pushups and figure out what it feels like to be in the right position vs wrong position

#Shoulder Caving Push-up

https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/linedvibrantjaeger

*Why does this happen?*

There are two main reasons in my experience.

You can't set your shoulder properly
You are over 'tucking' your elbows because you used to do the T-pushup and are over-exaggerating in the other direction

Drills to help fix it.

* Improve your lower trap strength with Trap 3 Raises

* Exaggerate the shoulder setting process (roll the shoulders back and then down) and squeeze hard

* Stop over-tucking.

* Pick an easier progression that you can do without shoulder caving


#How to scale the push-up so anyone can do it

We've now gone through what a normal push-up looks like, and then all the common faults/compensations. You may have just tried to do a standard pushup. If it is the case that you either couldn't, or could not stop yourself from compensating in one of the above ways in order to complete the rep, this section is for you.

In actuality, the standard push-up with good form on the floor is quite hard. It is a basic and fundamental movement in calisthenics from a relative perspective, but to a complete sedentary beginner, there's quite a lot to it and you certainly won't be good at push-ups for a while if you are starting from 0. Many very strong people have difficulty fixing up their form immediately just due to years of ingraining poor patterns if nothing else. That is another reason why it's very important to start with good movement quality from the get-go. No needing to change the way you move entirely months or years down the line.

So if you can't do a standard push-up at all, or at least without compensating, your new best friend is the Incline Push-up.

The Incline Push-up is arguably the only thing you will need (apart from arresting your ego) to get from where you are, to a standard floor push-up with impeccable form. This is because its infinitely scalable, and incredibly movement specific to the standard floor push-up.

https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/drearywellgroomedkarakul

The Incline Push-up is performed by placing your hands on a surface higher than your feet, and doing a pushup, thereby putting your body at an inclined angle. This puts slightly less of your bodyweight onto your arms (a standard floor pushup has approximately 70% of your bodyweight on your arms at the bottom. As you raise your hands higher than your feet, that value progressively decreases).

No matter how far you are from having the strength to do the standard push-up on the floor, there will be a degree of inclination that will make doing push-ups do-able for you. The angle of inclination in the gif is not the be-all end all. In fact it's one of the easiest angles. You can do it on any height of surface. As the height of the surface gets lower, the push-up gets harder, as more of the weight is in your hands.

You should be able to follow the form tips for the standard push-up on the floor for the incline pushup, with one slight modification. Instead of forearms vertical, set up your incline pushup at the bottom of the rep, so that your body is straight and the surface corner you are grabbing is contacting your body just below your pecs.

If you set up at the bottom like this, and return to this position every rep, you will naturally be assuming the equivalent of the forearms vertical position.

#How to make the push-up even harder

Ok now we've covered the standard pushup, AND progressions towards it. You might be the individual who is very comfortable with the standard push-up, and has impeccable form for sets of upwards of 10 to 15 reps. This following section covers the many ways you can alter the basic formula of a push-up to make it harder so you can keep progressing in strength. If you'd rather watch than read, I did a video covering '30 types of Push-up' a couple years ago. My form was not the cleanest back then, but it's still not a bad video for illustrative purposes. ***(NOT LINKED HERE COS SELF PROMOTION)***

Linking back to my point about the importance of drilling a fundamental movement to perfection, is that a large majority of these progressions will not require any further explanation on how to do them. If you follow the basic push-up form for most of these movements you'll be going along the right lines (with a few exceptions). As such, I've simply included gifs of these exercises. I'd expect most people to be comfortable with sets of 10 standard push-ups before moving on to trying more advanced variations. Even then, it would be worthwhile working on increasing your reps on standard push-ups at the same time as working on these harder variations.

This is far from an exhaustive list. These are just the ones I think are worth working on/the ones I know of.

#Frequently asked questions:

###I read that I should do wall push-ups if I can't do incline pushups, right?

Wall push-ups aren't great because the wall gets in the way of your face, which limits ROM. Better to get the same effect is to do an incline pushup on the corner of a surface that is justa few inches below chest height, so you can do full ROM, like so.

###Can I do knee push-ups instead of incline pushups?

You can, but they won't be as effective as incline pushups due to the sensitive scalability of the incline pushup, as well as the specificity to the bodyline of the standard pushup. The knee push-up may get you the strength you need to get a pushup but due to the positioning, it is likely to cause you to exhibit the booty push-up fault mentioned earlier in the article.

###I don't feel push-ups in my chest/triceps/shoulders. Am I doing them wrong?

Maybe. But if you aren't, it is not a problem if you don't feel them in the area you want. The weak link in the chain is always what you will feel first, and what will limit your performance. Here's an example.

You want to get a big chest, so you do push-ups. Your chest is pretty strong, and your anterior deltoid is very weak. You do push-ups, and you can do 10 reps, but the thing that really burns and stops you from doing 11, 12 or more reps, is your delts get too weak to push you up. You feel a huge pump in your deltoids, but nothing in your chest. That's not because you aren't doing them in a way that your chest is being worked, but rather because your delts are proportionally weaker, so need to catch up before the push-up will stress your chest to any meaningful degree. Don't skip out on strengthening your body proportionally because you are obsessed with [insert muscle] development. Your delts will catch up, and then your chest will grow. Be patient.

###All of this detail seems stupid, can't I just do push-ups the way I want?

Sure. I'm not the push-up police. Do whatever you want!

###My wrists hurt when I do push-ups. How can I fix this?

You may have weak wrists and would benefit from a thorough wrist warm-up before doing any wrist loading activities like push-ups. Here is one such routine!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE

If you want to keep doing push-ups with hurt wrists, you can always get low paralettes or 'push-up bars'. You can also change your hand position or do them on your fists. Whatever doesn't aggravate the injury.

###Are wide push-ups better for chest development?

No. They are good for very little. If you set your shoulder properly and don't 'T' your pushup, you can do them safely, but why would you? A harder pushup progression, or a weighted push-up will get you where you want better.

###What push-up is the best for chest development?

The hardest one you can do with good form. Also, weighted ring push-ups.

###Is 100/200/300/etc. Push-ups a day a good workout?

No. If that is all you are doing, you will develop imbalances that puts your shoulder in a fragile and injury prone state. You need to balance push and pull exercises. Also, doing that many push-ups will only make you good at doing push-ups. It won't really help muscle size, strength, etc.

###Can I do push-ups with my hands sideways/backwards?

Yes.

###Can I do push-ups on my fists?

Also yes.

###Why do I need to go all the way down?

Full Range of motion = Better strength and muscle gains. Partial reps have their place but shouldn't be the standard.

###Are push-ups or dips better?

Apples and Oranges. Ideally, do both.

###Are push-ups or bench press better?

Depends on your goal. If you want to be good at bench, do bench. If you want to be good at push-ups, do push-ups. If you want to push heavy weight and don't have anyway to micro-load your push-up, do bench. If you do have a way to micro-load your pushup, do whichever one you prefer. Simple stuff.

# More sets = better?

*Minimum and the best number of sets for noticeable results*

Do more sets will always mean better results? Is there a maximum number of sets per workout/week? How to choose the right number of sets if our goal is muscle growth?

Many people find it difficult to choose the right number of sets. It used to be difficult for me as well. First let's find out what factors affect the number of sets.

# Factors affecting the number of sets

\*This is a bit simplified and assumes that the rest of things remain the same and the only variable is the issue being described.

**1.Number of workouts per week.** Example: we've got 3 workouts per week, on each of them we do 4 sets of push ups (12 sets of push ups per week in total). Suddenly something happened in our life and now we have time for only 2 workouts. If we expect the same results as before we should increase the number of sets per workout to 6 so we still have 12 sets in total per week.

**2.Reps in reserve (RIR).** In general it's not the best idea to do each set to failure. Someone who does this, e.g. in each set does as much push ups as he/she can will not be able to (and probably shouldn't) as many sets as someone who keeps a rep or two (or more) in reserve (""tank"").

**3.Recovery.** Someone who sleeps well and enough, who don't stress as much in general in life will be able to recover better from harder workout.

**4.Energy availability.** The more calories we eat, the more we can do.

**5.Training** **experience.** Someone who is just starting their adventure with resistance training doesn't regenerate as well as someone who has several years of experience.

**6.Drugs usage.** External ""boosters"" allow us to do more and harder workouts in general.

So what is the minimum number of sets we should do for muscle growth?

# Minimum number of sets

Let's start with the minimum number of sets that's necessary for muscle growth. We've got a few papers here, e.g.  [D. B. Starkey et al., 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8897390/?fbclid=IwAR3IVLamtheELCMnOXQdFgFn9qqUeaaMqI9CS28w_3IJmlns80nkcwAOAWo); [Bent R. Rønnestad et al., 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17313291/?fbclid=IwAR1QjCa3l3jrSZw652W2SsCe_c1mNUw_Yaxg4ri8GMV9PYh1GnDw2Zzzpmg); [M. Bottaro et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0765159710001279?fbclid=IwAR1774dy-UAcx-nGoJNVWF29t6APIZvliZvcZicURfcjx4zNdNfiFZRsg8g); [Heiki Sooneste et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23249767/?fbclid=IwAR2c75RlV38hY-flGYP4piC8D-nBE-7f5RnZsf1dKC3oDl4I7y2QGYr9uVQ). They show us that even 1 set to failure per workout performed 2-3 times per week is enough to notice muscle growth in untrained people. [Karl J. Ostrowski et al., 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232177076_The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal_Output_and_Muscular_Size_and_Function?fbclid=IwAR3gzni30w8iC-tqWH1v0zE5mVoKGhHU5g6oBn1HzSbf6pBqRsaeqoC9URI) shows us that 2-3 sets to failure per week is enough even for experienced people.

This is also confirmed by this [meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-019-01236-0?fbclid=IwAR06LGS-yhLy3cTZt9yKAVVZ-36vqL9ad_GDVWi-Ig-dGpcDmsWTGRBdBg4) (a research that analyzes more researches). Here's what we can read in summary: performing 1 set to or close to failure, 6-12 rep range, 2-3 times per week is enough to make significant progres in muscle mass growth and strength (1RM).

In [this interesting study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19661830/) one group did 3 sets of knee extension and 1 set of bicep curls, the 2nd group vice versa. 8-12 rep range, 2 times per week. There was a significant growth of bicep brachii in both groups, but not in rectus femoris. It can be caused by the reason that we use the rectus femoris muscle much more in our daily life than bicep and it's already not that easy to grow that muscle. Or some muscle groups need more volume than the others? We don't know yet, but more likely it's beacuse the first reason.

It seems that for both unexperienced and experienced people **2-3 sets** to failure per muscle group per week for significant muscle growth. But to be 100% sure I'd suggest to do twice as much if you're already experienced in resistance training.

If training is not a priority for someone and doesn't care about maximizing results, even such a short workotu will be MUCH better than doing nothing.We can use this fact e.g. if we are on holiday or if we don't have enough time to do a full workout.

# Optimal number of sets

What's the best number of sets which result in the best muscle growth and strength? Where's the upper limit above which we will not notice any greater gains? Or maybe more always = better?

[F. Damas, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268828/) shows us that doing 12 sets results in only slightly more MPS increase (the most important process in muscle building, like adding another bricks to the wall which are our muscles) than doing 8 sets per muscle group per workout to failure and that difference in MPS increase was probably caused by more muscle damage in 12 sets group (bricks had to be used for repairing the wall rather than building bigger wall).**Conclusion:** the upper limit of number of sets **per workout** per muscle group is somewhere between 8 and 12.

[K. J. Ostrowski, 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232177076_The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal_Output_and_Muscular_Size_and_Function) were 3 groups: 1st was doing 7 sets for tricep, 2nd 14 sets, 3rd 28 sets divided into 2 training sessions **per week**. Growth of triceps for each group:Group 1, 7 sets: 2,3%Group 2, 14 sets: 4,7%Group 3, 28 sets, 4,8%

We can see that the difference between group 2 and 3 was very little, almost unnoticeable.**Conclusion:** the upper limit of number of sets **per workout** per muscle group is somewhere between 7 and 14 sets (similar to the above research)

[B. J. Schoenfeld, 2016 meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27433992/) summarized 15 studies comparing 1-4 vs. 5-9 vs. 10+ sets per muscle group per week. Muscle growth in 10+ sets was almost twice as large as in 1-4 sets. It is worth mentioning that the increase in 1-4 sets - although smaller - was still at a really good level. Generally speaking, **10-20 sets per week per muscle group** is the best choice. If you do below 10 and the progres is a bit slow, then you should consider increasing the number of sets. On the other side, if you do more than 20 sets and you've reached plateau or the progres is slower and slower, you should consider decreasing the number of sets.

[S. R. Heaselgrave, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30160627/), 3 groups: 9 sets, 18 sets and 27 sets for bicep per week. The greatest increase in muscle mass were in 18 sets group, even though the difference between all groups wasn't that big.

We should keep in mind a few things:

1.10-20 sets/week is an average value. There were single people in the study who responded better to a lower or higher number of series.

2.All sets were taken to or close to failure, 6-12 rep range.

3.Both too small and to many sets are not optimal for building muscle mass. It's worth remembering and start looking in that 10-20 set range per muscle group.

4.More is not always better! If the upper limit of sets is 20 it doesn't mean that we always should do 20 sets per week per each muscle group. Our body will quickly say ""enough"" and we'll not see any further progress. Muscles don't grow during our workouts, but afterwards. It's our body's response to the stimulus of workout that results in an increase in muscle mass. That's why must find a happy medium between a hard workouts and recovery.

5.The more advanced we are, the more sets we need. Closer and more frequently in 15-20 sets range per week than 10-15 (14 actually :D)

# TL;DR | Summary

There's no one the best number of sets. It's very individual. This post is only a general guidline.

**Minimum number of sets for muscle growth:** 2-3 for beginners, 3-6 for advanced, per week per muscle group, to failure.

**Optimum number of sets for muscle growth per workout:** 5-10 per muscle group, to or close to failure

**Optimum number of sets for muscle growth per week:** 10-20 per muscle group, to or close to failure

No progress and you do 5-8 sets per muscle group per week to or close to failure? Increase number of sets

No progress and you do 20-25 sets per muscle group per week to or close to failure? Decrease number of sets

More does not always = better!

The difference between training your core and training your abs,gregoryscottfit,1219,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/58c3sx/the_difference_between_training_your_core_and/,1476903853.0,"Hey all ! I went ahead and made a short video on the difference between training your entire core and just training your abs

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lbPFvOAHfc

Everybody wants abs and to be shredded. In a sea of false information we can easily get mislead or manipulated.

Most people fail to realize two things. 

* The core is actually a group of muscles that include the lower back, obliques, and hip flexors
* Seeing visible abs is a result of having a certain body fat percentage

Doing a million sit ups and crunches isn't going to get you abs.

To progress properly and reduce the chance of injury and muscle imbalances it's critical to have an all around strong core. I myself neglected training my entire core and had issues that effected me for a long time. The 5 exercises i show in the video and exercises i did to strengthen my core are

* Planks (core stability / endurance)
* Weight shift planks (dynamic core stability)
* Side planks (obliques)
* Hollow body (#1 drill)
* Supermans (lower back/ core stability

Perform these as reps as sets or in a circuit to get that heart rate going and burn some fat !
These exercises were my go to when i first started training. Hollow body holds are my favorite and super effective.  What are you guys go to and favorite exercises to train the core?

* Hand Release Push Ups (A push up where, at the bottom ROM, you lay on your chest and lift your hands off the ground before starting the next rep.)
* 50m sprint, drag (90lb sled), lateral (side step), carry (2x40lb) and sprint 
* Leg Tucks (in a two arm, bent arm hang on a pull-up bar raise your knees until they touch your elbows)
* Two Mile Run

Random observations:

* Dead Lifts! I find that getting strong at Dead Lifts has made the most difference in my every day life. But that's mostly because I have young kids and I'm always picking up heavy stuff off the ground. I can see why this would help soldiers in the Army who are also picking up heavy stuff all the time.
* Hand Release Push-Ups make sense. I think they are slightly deeper ROM than just chest to hands AND like a proper dead lift, they require you to remove all tension from your arms before starting the next rep. I will try these next workout and see how much harder they are than ""regular"" push ups.
* Leg Tucks are basically 90 degree pull up static hold with a tucked leg lift. It's supposed to somewhat simulate climbing an obstacle, I believe.
* Standing Power Throw puzzles me the most. Supposedly it simulates throwing equipment onto... tall objects? Or something? Can anyone tell me what this is measuring?"

We need to normalize maintenance mode,PsychologicalRice758,1203,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/12zj3ia/we_need_to_normalize_maintenance_mode/,1682518927.0,"In the fitness community we always talk about the most optimal way of doing things, the most extreme strategies. But we never address the biggest problem in fitness ( lack of consistency) 

I think most people don't do fitness for living but they still want to be fit. And such is life filled with stressful periods. We all go through those times. I personally stopped working out in grade 12(what a big mistake i did, i could have workouted out once a week and maintenanced all my gains)

And this is what i am preaching here:
Don't stop working out at least do a nice workout once a week. You neeed the fraction of work to maintain. Even when you get injured a very very fatal mistake is completely stop. The better approach is to work around the injury coming out of rehab stronger than before. 

Like honestly idk if people listen or this might help someone but personally i will never stop working out. If i can't do my main workout i will try to do a workout once a week at least or do 3 easier workouts. I will never let myself regress. Staying where i am is better than going down hill. And I would say the biggest benefit is not that i keep my gains, but that i don't exercise the toxic self sabotaging mindset."
This is a post for the injured and those who lost motivation or progress because of an injury.,DarrenPotter,1210,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/m2gqf3/this_is_a_post_for_the_injured_and_those_who_lost/,1615433080.0,"TLDR: I went from the ideal body image (peak) got injured and lost most of my progress. But if you don't keep pushing to fix yourself, no one will do it for you. You are in charge of your injury. Don't get complacent and lose it all and blame everything on the injury. I started doing that, and I lost most of who I was. But I never gave up and am now recovering, fixing the weak muscles, and will eventually get back to the muscular self I used to be. Don't compare yourself to your past self because you're not that person anymore. Create your new self, be proud of your everyday accomplishments and whatever you do DON'T GIVE UP.

In the Summer of 2019, I was benching two plate bench presses and was the guy that people would ask about my exercises or flock to me because I was physically and noticeably fit.

In September of 2019, I somehow hurt myself doing incline press and felt this weird tingling go through my shoulder into my neck and back. Eventually, my back would flare up (swell) twice it's size in the scapular/rear delt shoulder area and it would become hot and painful. I took breaks to let it heal but it did not heal. 

Months later: My doctor sent me for an ultrasound after ultrasound even though I insisted I get an MRI done. He began to tell me my problem was psychological, that it had to do with something I was doing in my daily life that I needed to figure out. My life went from trying to go workout to always getting swollen and eventually I lost all motivation. I became sedimentary, it felt hopeless.

2020 September: Eventually, after consistently getting zero results from the ultrasounds, I demanded to see a sports doctor. I was referred to one and had an appointment within the next months. However, Covid set so all the MRI's took months to get done.

2020 Late November: MRI's finally get done and I've started physio again with little hope that anything will actually get better.

2020 December: the Doctors see my MRI's low and behold I have a Labral Tear in the Labrum (Shoulder tear). These tears cannot be fixed without surgery. I get sent to a surgeon.

2021 January: The surgeon says I do indeed have a labral tear which would explain shoulder pain in the front and instability. However, some of the pain I have in my Scapula may not be from that spot. I have a winged scapula and a labral tear. 

2021 February: I start consistently doing all the physio exercises and am saddened by how I went from a top-tier athlete to a sluggish not so fit 26 year old. I can hardly lift the weights I used to and am lifting the lowest weights I've ever lifted.

2021 March: Since doing the exercises consistently I have begun to feel less pain and discomfort from my scapula. My winged scapula has started to wing less and my serratus anterior muscle in my shoulder is getting stronger. 

2021 present: I am starting to back to the gym again. I (only) did an hour of cardio today but I am feeling more motivated than ever to get back to my old self. I made this post because I can understand how hard it is for people who are injured to see themselves slowly lose all their progress. I also, understand how it feels when you can't do the thing you love doing (going to the gym). But my biggest advice to those people is don't give up. Figure out what's wrong and if you come up with nothing go elsewhere and see someone else another doctor or another physiotherapist. Commit to the exercises, you can only make the difference. Yes, the small weights make you sad but the progress will make you motivated. My shoulder pain I think came from multiple things, a torn labrum and a tear elsewhere that made my serratus so weak that it winged so far that I had lost a lot of control of motion. Now, I am focused on continuing to strengthen that muscle that got weak until I am finally ''normal"" and I can start getting my life back. I notice I have weakness from the Labrum tear, so I'll likely need surgery but I just want you to know that no matter what, you are in charge of your life. Your injury is not. It's easier said than done and I understand it's heartbreaking to lose progress and feel stuck but you need to keep trying or you can lose yourself too. Just because you're injured and don't look as buff as you did at your peak does not mean you're any less attractive. Be easy on yourself but not complacent. Understand your current limitations, because if you don't acknowledge them then you might hurt yourself more before having a chance to get back. The great thing about hitting rock bottom is there is always room to improve and each improvement is significant to your motivation, and to someday getting back to where you were.  


I have a friend who was also in great shape and got injured and he went from 170 pounds to now bordering 300+ and makes excuses why he can't get back or gets really upset when his friends try to help. He got stuck and blames everything on his injury. It's an easy place to fall into. I did too. But you can't give up because no one will fix it for you. Let go of what you looked like before the injury and look forward to what you want to look like. Make small reasonable goals (ie., I want to minimize the pain and weakness in my shoulder. So look up rehab videos on youtube (PRehabguys) or go see a physiotherapist). Once those goals are achieved, rebuild yourself.   


The biggest takeaway I want you to get from this is you choose the path you want to walk. You can let your injury win and then blame it for you losing your health, your girlfriend, your sex life, etc or you can take charge of your life and make a change one reasonable goal at a time."
I finally reached 10 consecutive pull ups!,_nemocaptain_,1204,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/eta92x/i_finally_reached_10_consecutive_pull_ups/,1579871664.0,"I usually do 3-4 x max pull-up, reaching usually 6 for each set, yesterday I finally reached 10 reps for the first set, even though the last two barely went over my chin. My few takeaways:

- I underestimated how much mental goes into it, usually after rep number 6 I ""give up"", yesterday I just went with the mindset that I would reach 10 reps. We can achieve more reps than we think

- Grip strength can potentially improve your number. After I reached the 10th pull-up I could barely open my hands, I had to stretch is out for a few minutes before going for another set.

- Consistency is key, I started with calisthenics work outs nov/19 and couldn't do 1 pull-up, now I'm much stronger, if I were a bit more consistent with my training I would be doing 3-4x10 no problem.

I just wanted to share with you! Thanks."
"After 2 months of practice, I can finally do pull-ups",Lonely_Durian40,1187,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mx1xsj/after_2_months_of_practice_i_can_finally_do/,1619202883.0,"So, after just over 2 months of training (it's been 9 weeks since I got into bodyweight training) I can finally do proper pronated grip pull-ups. If you look through my profile, you'll see a post of me whining about the fact that I can't do pull-ups after 7 weeks of training. Well, now I can.  


As for how I feel, well I honestly though I'd feel happy, but I just feel releived. For quite a while, I thought I'd never be able to do pull-ups. I'd go into a hang and try pull myself up, but I was going nowhere. I could barely even bend my elbows. Same with chin-ups. It was really discouraging, and around the time I made my complaining post I felt like I wanted to give up. My very first goal when I started bodyweight fitness was to be able to do a pull-up, and when I was training the whole time I couldn't physically do it, It just felt like I was making no progress.  


As for any advice I can give, firstly I'll say that going through the progressions of the pull-up in the recommended routine is probably what helped the most. I'm pretty sure the weak link for me for the longest time was getting the scapular strength at the very start to initiate the movement. So to try compensate, I practiced with assisted pull-ups. These were good, they got me familiar with actually doing the movement, but the assistance made it so that my scapula didn't really have any opportunity to develop the proper strength to do it un-assisted. So when I started to get really frustrated at the lack of progress, I just decided to follow the recommended routine from the very beginning, even though I'd been training for 7 weeks at that point (that's definitely not a long period of time by any means, but the fact that I was putting in lots of effort with not much progress made it feel long). So I practiced scapular pulls along with negatives (I'd been training them ever since I'd started) and slowly I built up that strength to initiate the movement un-assisted. I got chin-ups first, firstly by jumping up for most of the movement, then starting off with my elbows bent and scapula already retracted, then eventually I could do a proper chin-up with full range of motion. Then I got onto neutral grip pull-ups, following much of the same progression, until I could do 4 proper ones. And then today, at the start of my workout, I decided to just go for proper pronated grip pull-ups, and I did 3! Since I could already do chin-ups and neutral grip, it didn't feel like a big leap or a big moment or whatever, but as I said already, I was just releived to finally be able to do what I've seen so many people do with ease before.  


At this point, it almost seems like I've forgotten all the frustration, uncertainty and effort I went through to get to this point. Now that I'm here, I've gained a confidence boost knowing that I can achieve goals like this even if I have quite a hard time doing it, and now I can only get better. Well that's all I have to say, I tried to give this post some sort of structure but I'm not very good at that so I hope you got something good out of it regardless."

Instead of health, a lot of folks are anxious about their looks  and instead of strength and mobility, some are focused on weight or other numbers.

Goals are great, but sometimes our goals are based on arbitrary beliefs we have about ourselves or the ""correct"" way to be fit. If you hate yourself in your current body, chances are you'll hate yourself in a muscular body too. 

Meditation as a practice has helped me rebuild my mental self defenses from intrusive thoughts and negative mental loops that were impediments to my well being. As a practice, it can be as simple as taking a few deep breaths and calmly visualizing your workout or it could be a longer sit/lay down.

You don't need to get woo woo w/ crystals to benefit (not that there's anything wrong with that) but for me, being healthy and fit means taking time to take care of my mind as much, if not more than my body."
One Year Calisthenics Progress,G_ramirez181818,1178,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qmzp5j/one_year_calisthenics_progress/,1636074488.0,"https://imgur.com/gallery/AGP3bot

Hey everyone, it’s officially been one year since I started my calisthenics journey. Just thought I’d share progress and potentially motivate some people. 

Stats: Male, 5’10”, 150 lbs, 23 yo. 

Diet: For my diet I kind of just stopped tracking calories. But if I had to guess I’d say I eat around 2000-2500 calories a day. Most of my food is home cooked and consists of a lot of chicken, rice, beef, fish, pasta, vegetables of all kinds and fruit. 

Routine: I split my workouts into four sections and take one rest day in between cycles. My split is back and biceps, chest and triceps, shoulders, legs. I like to change things up so sometimes I add weight to certain exercises, sometimes I decrease rest and sometimes I slow down the pace, just depends how my body is feeling on any given day. Also I usually do abs for 10 minutes at the end of each workout. Also I train skills randomly, I’ll do front lever work on off days or at random points of the day before I actually workout and same for planche and handstands. Currently I can hold a solid front lever for about 8 seconds, advanced tuck planche and the handstand for 5-6 seconds. 

Back and biceps: Pull ups 3 x 10, supinated straight bar dips 3 x 10, neutral grip pull ups 3 x 10, body weight bicep curls 3 x 10, chin ups 3 x 10, resistance band curls 3 x 10, isometric holds with chin above the bar then arms at 45 degrees then dead hang 3 x 10 seconds in each position. 

Chest and triceps: Dips 3 x 10, deep pushups on parallettes 3 x 10, archer push ups 3 x 6 on each side, diamond push ups 3 x 10, pronates straight bar dips 3 x 10, body weight skull crushers 3 x 10, bench dips 3 x 10, tricep extensions 3 x 10, decline push ups 3 x 10. 

Shoulders: Tuck planche 3 x 10 seconds, wall assisted hand stand push ups 3 x 7, wall assisted hand stand holds 4 x 30 seconds, pseudo planche pushups 3 x 10, scapula push ups 3 x 10.

Legs: pistol squats 3 x 8 on each side, one leg glute raises 3 x 12 on each side, one leg calf raises 3 x 12 on each side, Squats 3 x 15, lunges 3 x 15 on each side. 

If anyone has any questions or comments feel free to leave em. Thanks!"
Mental Hack for Rep Counting,Niznash,1186,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/h0cdxk/mental_hack_for_rep_counting/,1591800153.0,"Others may or may not find this useful. Your milage may vary.

I personally find it psychologically easier to complete a set if I count reps down rather than up; there's something comforting about seeing the remaining number shrink to zero.

Needless to say, it also is easier to lose count if the number you're counting towards is far.

I use a pyramid counting scheme first counting up and, in the middle, switching to counting down. It really helps me so I thought I'd share.

---

When I perform a set with an even rep goal like 8 or 10, I count up to the half point and then count down to zero. For example, if 8 reps then: 1-2-3-4-3-2-1-0.

If the number is odd, find your ""middle"" by dividing by 2 and rounding down. You'll need to repeat that number twice. For example, for 7 reps, that middle is 3, then you get: 1-2-3-3-2-1-0

This way, half the set feels like you're adding work and then half the set feels like there are less and less remaining.

"You can get strong hamstrings with minimal equipment in the streets, in nature or at home. I made a video with the simplest progressions and setups for the Nordic curl, and this post contains more info and an easier alternative (sliding/suspended/rolling curl).",RockRaiders,1178,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dknhi5/you_can_get_strong_hamstrings_with_minimal/,1571595782.0,"**NORDIC CURLS**

**[The video](https://youtu.be/2pADOPfH7z0).**

Some benefits of getting strong at this movement are hamstring strength, size, injury resilience and better jumping and running. It's trained by athletes of many sports.

I already have [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/88cvqe/the_nordic_curl_the_ultimate_hamstring_bodyweight/) that I keep updating with all the setups, progression methods and tips that I find, in the video I picked the simplest ones.

The main new thing I figured out is how to reliably set up Nordic curls by attaching a strap to trees or poles or pillars etc. with any thickness that allows to put one foot on each side (so around hip width is the widest diameter that works), and for one leg greater diameters still work, in the past I showed this method for thin poles but now it works in more cases and more consistenty.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/KuA3bmp.png) is an image showing how to attach yourself, the most versatile way is closing the strap around the object, but for some thin poles it does not work well so the old method of looping a strap through itself is better. After putting the feet in the strap you have to tighten it as much as you can to prevent it from sliding up. You could just squeeze the object with the feet alone, but unless the friction is very good and you have strong adductors or you are doing a beginner variation your feet will slide up without the strap.

And there could be even more portable setups. [This drill thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ahsi47YcHI) can be used on fields with no trees, but unfortunately it's quite expensive at around $300. A more optimized version of this, if it's possible and cheap, could be a way to to Nordic curls in most places of the world.

A summary of tips:

* Use a strap and anchor point that can support at least 200% of your weight. In a straight body concentric a person of average proportions pushes up with a force of around 115% of their weight, and more if done explosively or with arms overhead or added weight. To test that your setup is immovable try pushing as hard as you can from the bottom position.
* Use adequate knee padding, an Airex pad cheaper imitation is the most comfortable I found, but you can use folded mats, towels or pillows etc., and if you know of something that is cheap, light, fits in a small backpack and is reliable even for sensitive knees and straight body concentrics let me know. 
* Don't work through pain - find the right intensity and sets per week, it's the same as getting stronger for other moves so 8-15 sets per week of anywhere between 3-10 reps divided into 2-4 sessions is a possible guideline.
* Control the negative and try to do an explosive concentric (or least slow you can, if it's hard). Some anterior pelvic tilt is ok unless it causes lower back discomfort, and posterior pelvic tilt can be used for higher difficulty.
* The progressions requiring the least equipment are touching a gradually more distant point with the nose (starting level with the closest point possible is like a kneeling squat and suitable for most beginners) or using gradually less hand assist (while the hamstrings still work as hard as possible, it's not a plyo kneeling pushup).

**SLIDING/SUSPENDED/ROLLING LEG CURLS**

Here are some leg curl alternative progressions with even more versatility, they could be used to expand the Recommended Routine's hinge progression options, since they are scalable and have some long term potential although not as much as Nordic curls. It's my suggestion if any moderator is reading this.

They're all a variation of the glute bridge curl (stay extended at the hips, bend only at the knees). You can do them with a suspension system (rings or strap + handle etc.) or with something that lets you slide (socks on smooth wood, furniture sliders etc.) or roll (small skateboard or even [a basketball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5tR6S91J10), stability ball, ab wheel, rolling chair etc., rolling has a smoother resistance curve). Examples:

* [Feet suspended, back in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDIMaKa_QbM) 
* [Hands suspended, feet in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4-9l57Y-28) (suspended hamstring bodycurl).
* [Feet slide/roll, back in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPBVyE5vwZI).
* [Back slides, feet in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzvQZcZHZ8E) (hamstring bodycurl).

For any of these progressions, complete beginners can do them with bent hips. Then you can do them with a straight body, and in the suspended versions having the stationary body part further from the suspended body part makes them harder, and any of these can be done with one leg or added weight or band resisted. More elevated feet is also an option.

One leg sliding on a smooth wood floor with socks felt comparable to Nordic curls in difficulty for me, so it can be an adequate challenge for quite a while, that's why I think these should be an option in the Recommended Routine hinge progression.

Example progression from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxx55fnwVa8): alternating legs -> two leg negative -> two legs -> two legs squeezing an object between the knees -> one leg negative -> one leg.

So for example you can hang some straps from a branch and do suspended bodycurls if the trees are too big for Nordic curls attached to them or you don't have adequate padding for the knees that fits in a backpack, or you can do sliding/rolling leg curls at home if you don't have heavy furniture or the door frames won't support a door jam or telescopic bar etc., though the plank setup is quite cheap."

There are many different ways to regress/progress this exercise, so start with the level that's appropriate for you. If you're not sure which one you could hold, start with the first one and when you could hold it for at least 60seconds, move to the next one.

 * Don't bend and unbend at the hips unnecessarily
 * If you feel any unsmoothness in your roll, YOU'RE NOT HOLLOW!
 * Start with the legs more piked to help make it easier to transition.
1. Hollow *Rocks* with ankle weights

###Overview 

The static ""hollow hold"" will be used to build a solid base of strength and endurance. If/When you've mastered the hold, you can start doing the ""hollow rocks"" will make the hollow hold a dynamic exercise and be a lot harder.

* For any of the holds (#1-4), make a goal of 1x60seconds before progressing to the next one.

* For any of the rocks (#5-6), make a goal of rocking for 3x20seconds before progressing.

* **Practice the level that's appropriate for you 3-4x per week.**

###Progression Tips:

* If you're early in the hollow hold training, begin with the arms by your sides and eventually you will raise them up overhead. That makes it harder.

* Note that between progression #2 and #3 is variable. Your feet don't have to go immediately from high to low, it's a gradual thing.

* If you think you've mastered the hollow hold, note that before transitioning to hollow rocks, the progression #4 recommends you get used to doing the hollow hold with some sort of weight on your feet (like a water bottle, or wear shoes or ankle weights). This will make your HH bulletproof.

###Form Tips:

* The shoulders and shoulder blades are slightly off the floor, just enough to prevent the ribs from flaring.
* Think about squeezing the legs and butt together and that will fire up your core even further.
* Point the feet.

#Time for you to check in!

###Get on the floor, set a timer and test your hollow hold in the progression that's appropriate for you and tell us how you did!

1. Which progression are you at and how many seconds/minutes were you able to perform it with perfect form?
1. Optional: Post a photo or video of you performing the hollow hold (or rocks) from the side! This serves as a motivator and also helps verify that your form is spot on.
1. Optional: Gender, Age, Height, Weight [kg/lbs please]

###Questions? Feel free to ask!

Next week, I'll post a follow up check-in thread so we'll see how we're progressing. But the main thing you should do is get some hollow hold practice in at least 3x every week.

&#x200B;

**Dips:** Full range of motion dips are often too challenging for people first starting out. Use a band to decrease the difficulty to work through a full range of motion. The band makes it possible for beginners to accumulate enough reps and volume to create an adapative response.

Technique - Pause at the bottom to minimise elastic recoil from the band. This small adjustment to technique will increase muscular effort and speed up progress. Use a band which gives minimal assistance and is challenging.

**Pull ups:** For those who can't do a single rep or want to increase their numbers, use eccentrics. The human body is approximately 120% stronger on the lowering phase, this is perfect for training. By working the pull up in reverse, we're strengthening the exact movement pattern and muscle groups used in the real deal.

Technique - Jump to the top of the bar and lower down to a scapula engaged hang. Each rep should take up to 8 seconds. This method is a nice mix of intensity and time under tension.

**Push Ups:** Training with a full range of motion is the most efficient and effective way to get stronger. Beginners often struggle with proper form on the ground, that's no problem. Use the incline push up to strengthen the chest, shoulders and arms and you'll be progressing to the ground in no time.

Technique - Keep the elbows within the scapula plane which is approximately 45°. When training think about staying between being completely tucked/flared.

**Rows:** Horizontal pulling with the bodyweight row is a must for beginners looking to develop scapula, back and arm strength.

Technique - Keep a rigid body alignment like in a plank and pull until the bar meets the chest. The focus should be on retracting the scapula during the pulling phase.

**Handstand:** Building a base level of overhead strength is important for beginners looking to start their handstand journey. Practicing the pike handstand will build confidence being upside down and also develop upper body strength.

Technique - Elevate the feet on a box, stack the hips over the shoulders, forming an L-shape. Look between the hands and push tall through the shoulders.

It seems like the top part of the ROM is really that much harder than the middle section, and that is also what I found to be the case with normal pullups. What a lot of people call pullups aren't pullups, they're partial pullups."

I've frequented this sub for a couple years now, and still have trouble decoding the quasi-military newspeak some people use. Apparently OHP and OHPU are different things. Those two terms could mean overhead press, overhead press-up, one handed pushup, one handed pullup. The list goes on and the same can be said for so many other abbreviations. This came to a head for me today when I saw a post about YTWLs, and I could not for the life of me figure out what those letters could possibly stand for. Turns out you just raise your arms in the shape of the letters, but the amount of abbreviations used around here makes that unclear. 

There seem to be abbreviations for every single exercise with little to no reason for actually abbreviating them. It's a text-based site. Why are we using such incomprehensible terminology?"

I've been lurking for several weeks now, this is my first post. I'm in awe of the level of skill and knowledge you all posses. Thanks for the inspiration! 

I have always been relatively unhealthy, both in diet and life choices. I've been skinny in the past, but never fit. Last summer/fall I was dealing with a lot of work  & family stress  and ramped up my drinking and bingeing. It left me too big for  all my clothes and very depressed. 

I began running in September  and cut out a lot of the fat, but took a 6 week break after it got cold and resumed  my unhealthy habits. I finally said enough is  enough!!! I quit drinking, quit smoking cigarettes, changed my diet,  and began to exercise. 

I'm still familiarizing myself with all the exercises on the beginners workout, but I can do most of them. And I'm averaging about 10-12 miles ran per week. 

Just wanted to share my success!  I can't wait to see  what ill  be able to accomplish as the weeks go by. I'm overwhelmed with the amount of information out there diet, supplements, and exercise. Although I have been strengthening  my wrists to begin handstands :P My 7 year old daughter will love  that!


Thank you all and I look forward  to being part of this neat  community!

P.s. I'm  5'3"" and 143lbs. 


*****Edit: Since some have asked, both here and imgur, this is why I felt inclined to share. 

When I began this journey, I searched for images of women who went from fat to fit. What I found were women who were not overweight at all. They were mostly slender -- just with no muscle tone. I did not see anyone that looks like me. I wanted to show other people who did look like me that it was possible to make healthy changes with hard work! It is not easy, but it is possible. I am here to listen if anyone is struggling with body image issues, ED, addiction, BDD, depression, or just plain pissed about their looks. Love to you all! You are beautiful in every way, just the way you are... if you want to change, it is possible! Do it for you, Don't try to do it all at once, and love yourself along the way.


TL;DR: had issues, got fat, dealt with issues, got fit. Yay."
"I did my first Pull-up today! + Don‘t use banded pull-ups, use negatives instead",hooseee,1171,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jdqigi/i_did_my_first_pullup_today_dont_use_banded/,1603062795.0,"Today is a great day, as I finally achieved my first pull-up!! Want to share my story quickly:

I was always quite fit, playing multiple sports, going for runs, and, for 1-2 years, getting in 3-4 gym workouts per week. But now in my late 20s, life caught up with me. I had not done any strength training for 5 years. Then, after Covid slowed down a bit in July, I stepped in a gym for the first time in forever. I was floored: I could not do a single dip, barely finished a hand full of pushups, and then hung off a bar like a dead fish when trying to perform a pull-up.

I did what beginners do and watched some YT vids about pull-up progression. The most commonly recommended progression was using bands + doing some accessory work like Australian pull-ups. I went to the gym with my newly bought bands twice a week and progressed quite nicely - in the beginning. I went from 3x3 to 3x8 with the heaviest band. Then on to the medium band from 3x3 to 3x6 to .... well, that’s it. Within 5-6 weeks after starting to work out again, I could no longer progress at all. I was stuck doing 3x6 pull-ups with the medium band, which I did for about 3 weeks getting increasingly frustrated.

This is where this great community comes in: After spending hours researching what the solution to my problem was, I stumbled across r/bodyweightfitness. When studying the recommended routine, I noticed it integrates negative pullups instead of bands. I thought to myself: Well, these guys must know. I adapted my routine, switching from banded pull-ups to negatives. 
And then, BOOM! After performing my adapted routine for only a couple of weeks, my back strength had increased significantly. I got stronger and stronger. And then today, I finally pulled up my full bodyweight, from a dead hang to chin over the bar. What a feeling!

TLDR: I did my first pull-up today. Hope this motivates some people. Banded pull-ups are okay-ish when starting out from scratch, but negatives proved to be far superior in gaining strength.

Thanks community, I learned a great deal from reading the RR and all your great posts. Stay strong, r/bodyweightfitness !



Edit:

Wow, thanks bwf for all the upvotes and positive comments! Glad to get some discussion going as well.

As some of you have pointed out, bands do have their place in strength training. For pull-ups specifically, they’re very useful when starting out from scratch and not being able to do negatives properly. Only do negative pull-ups if you can lower yourself in a controlled manner! Still, if you’re stuck in your banded pull-up progression like I was, I highly suggest giving negative pull-ups a try.

For all beginners reading this, make sure to read/follow the r/bodyweightfitness FAQ and [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) - great stuff!"

This is my first post on this sub, but I have been reading it regularly for advice on my own training.

I just wanted to show you guys how I have progressed in the past year of exclusively bodyweight training. For reference:

Before: 1.83m 71kg 16 years old                            After: 1.86m  75kg 17 years old

I've always been a fit person, having played sports like Field hockey, football (Soccer) my whole life, but I always lacked upper body strength. At the start of my journey, I could only do 5 dodgy form push ups, and couldn't even do a pull up.

I started how most do, doing push ups, australian pull ups/inverted rows, pull up negatives, that sort of thing. I always had strong legs because I was a leg day addict in the past, so I learnt the pistol squat pretty quickly, within a month.

I did progress pretty well in the first 3 months, got up to 8 pull ups, 13 dips approximately, learnt the L-sit, but lost motivation pretty quickly because I wrongly believed that I was 'too good'.

Yes

I just said that.

But around january of this year I got back into training hard, running A PPL, PPC split every week (Push , Pull, Legs) (Push, Pull, Cardio).

Things were going well, and then Covid came and kinda messed things up, but I saw this as an opportunity to push things and work even harder. I invested in a pair of gymnastics rings and saw this as a chance to take things to a new level. Like most starting out on rings, I struggled majorly, but I eventually adapted, and am now performing some sort of advanced exercises.

I did find it difficult to progress on statics mainly because of my height, but I managed to make some decent progress

To show you how I have progressed overall:

Start:

0 pull ups

5 Push ups

1 dip

No-sit

0 pistol squats

Absolutely 0 iron cross

Absolutely 0  Back lever

1 year later:

1rm 35kg weighted pull up

1 RTO archer push up each side

1rm 48kg weighted dip

Long af l-sit

5 reps 22kg weighted pistol squat each leg

Ring assisted iron cross 5 seconds

Straddle Back lever 7 seconds

If you've read all of this, you have no life, just kidding haha, but thank you if you have read all of this. This sub-reddit has helped me immensely, especially advice from  [u/Antranik](https://www.reddit.com/user/Antranik/) ,

[**u/eshlow**](https://www.reddit.com/user/eshlow/), and countless others.

I really hope this has motivated you that you can change yourself and your body immensely in just a year. I will attach a link to my transformation on YouTube if you'd like to take a look at it :)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdHkA2c-kwQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdHkA2c-kwQ)

My diet:

Breakfast: Oats boiled in water with chia seeds, mixed frozen berries, cinnamon (sometimes might add a scoop of protein powder if I feel like it but I usually don't)

Lunch: Usually a ham or chicken sandwich

Dinner: A one-pan meal of a protein source (usually prawns, chicken, ham, lean beef), potatoes, carrots, lentils or chickpeas or another vegan protein source, mixed in with vegetable stock and tomato puree.

Snack (Usually late at night or some time during the day):

One of: Popcorn, greek yoghurt, protein bar, my homemade ice cream, homemade healthy brownies.

I eat clean most of the time, and cook pretty much all my meals myself, using largely low calorie ingredients, so I would use little olive oil, wouldn't use added sugar etc.

For my 'unhealthy meals' like homemade ice cream, I would use low-cal ingredients to create something like a litre of ice cream for 400 calories or something like that.

I told him ""When we all start, we all kinda look dumb in a way. That's the reality. The only way to fix that is repetition."" 

Today was his first day working out! I told him before lifting heavier he has to make sure his form and motion are in check. So we worked out back and biceps and lifted light so we can start with his posture and form. I'm proud because he got through the whole 1 hour workout. We limited his back exercises, because he does have some back problems, but he did so well! I'm really proud he actually wanted to workout and got through it! I really hope he wants to continue, because I want him to live a healthy lifestyle. He's been a really skinny guy, but he wants to change that about him. 

But anyways I just wanted to share my workout story for today! Thanks for taking the time to read this!

PS: If there's any advice/tips you can give to him about starting off I'd be happy to relay it to him!

REPORT! I did 100 pull ups a day for 30 days. The result was amazing!!,TienLam1302,1159,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a9asap/report_i_did_100_pull_ups_a_day_for_30_days_the/,1545701372.0," 

I want to share with you guys my experience after doing 100 pull-ups a day for a month.

&#x200B;

The method I use is Greasing the Grove (GTG). People here at BWF must be heard about it before.

It's a high-frequency, submaximal training method. Basically, you do sets of your 50%-80% max pull up reps throughout the day with long rest between and never go to fatigue.

&#x200B;

I did 10 Pull ups with very bad form on the initial test.

So I start the first day with 6 pull ups per set and do 10 sets with total 60 pull ups.

Try to increase set/reps every day, finally, I reach the goal of doing 100 pull ups in the eleventh day.

After that, I was focused on form, not on the number. I try to pull up to the chest and keep my legs straight. I also try harder variations like L-sit pull up.

I got hit by flu at the end of the challenge. After 2 days off, I went for the final test.

I can do 11 chest-to-bar pull ups.

&#x200B;

Overall, I very happy with the result!

The number of max rep increases not much (maybe because of the flu) but the form improved a lot.

If I don't pull to chest, I will do more reps, but I don't care about that.

After the challenge, I realize the importance of form in pull up or any exercise.

Quality over quantity!

Now I can do not only pull up but also muscle up!

&#x200B;

And I know this method is not optimized for hypertrophy by I still have good gains on my back (maybe because I was focused on form instead of rep).

Other reasons for my success:

* I 'm not tall and heavy (170cm and 63 kg).
* I have good endurance (I run about 50km a week).

Sorry for my bad English. I am Asian :)))

Great tip for learning the L-sit (no equipment needed),None,1159,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/m3owmy/great_tip_for_learning_the_lsit_no_equipment/,1615576823.0,"Do it in the bath! The less you fill the bath, the harder the L-sit will be as more of your body will be out of the water once you assume the position.

Similarly, if you fill the bath right up, more of your body will be under the water making it nice and easy for you to hold the L-Sit

Using your natural buoyancy in the water to help you as your legs and butt will float making it easier for your arms, shoulders, back and abs to hold the position

As long as you have a bath and water, it's free and no need for those expensive resistance bands and tricky setups

If you're not able to hold it for a second yet naturally, you'll be able to hold it for quite a long time in the bath! Thought it was quite a handy trick"
"Archer Push Ups are a great chest and triceps exercise, so i've made a tutorial for you. You'll learn them today!",tykato,1160,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5wvlpz/archer_push_ups_are_a_great_chest_and_triceps/,1488373302.0,"Hey athletes of /r/bodyweightfitness!

Archer Push Ups are a great exercise for your chest, triceps and your deltoids, so i made a video tutorial for them. They are quite easy to learn, if you watch out for a few form cues, so i hope you enjoy it.

If you don't want to watch the video, i'll also include an explantion below.

* For the archer push ups, **[you start in a plank position](http://imgur.com/ByQ4CDi)** and externally rotate your arms, while keeping them about double-shoulder width apart.

* **[Hand positioning in the upper part.](http://imgur.com/0EbN9yv)**

* Now you lean to one side, while keeping the other arm completely straight. **[The bottom position should look like this](http://imgur.com/VvD1kxu)** While you do so, internally rotate your arm and keep your elbow close to your body.

* **[Hand positioning in the bottom part.](http://imgur.com/tmmLnX8)**

* Now you press up into the starting position, while keeping the elbow of the straight arm completely straight. Repeat to the other side.

* Form cues: You need to keep your straight arm completely straight at all times, or you're doing a biceps exercise - which isn't the goal of the archer push up. You want to train your chest, triceps and your deltoids - and this is best achieved by having your elbow straight. This way, your biceps and brachialis aren't activated as much. This also makes the exercise much harder!

* A good way to build up to archer push ups is, by starting weighted push ups and work up to 20%-30% of added bodyweight. Once you are able to do 2-3 reps with that weight added, you'll find negative archers easily achievable, and real archer push ups aren't far away.

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and find it helpful to achieve this new cool skill. :) I've got a few questions aswell, to start a discussion:

* If you can already do them, what progression did you use to learn archer push ups?

* Have you tried archers before and failed to keep your arm straight? What was the reason?

How I Got A Free Handstand Pushup In 1 Year: The 4 Steps Anyone Can Take To Build An Excellent Foundation,calisthenics_hacker,1155,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dav5vj/how_i_got_a_free_handstand_pushup_in_1_year_the_4/,1569763990.0,"After my 1 year transformation post some people asked me about what I did to get the free handstand pushup.

Here’s a video with the 4 steps I first took to build the foundation:

[https://youtu.be/w3sc1-QNuG8](https://youtu.be/w3sc1-QNuG8)

Well, the truth is that if you follow these steps you’ll spend enough time building the foundation and then you won’t get stuck in plateaus like most people.

I’ve seen so many people doing it wrong that I wanted to lay out a proper plan so that you can stick to it and get real results.

And yes you can follow this plan even if you don’t have a 30 second handstand (the standard requirement to do presses and free handstand pushups).

But please also train your handstand or you’ll have to do the handstand pushups next to the wall and that’s not cool haha.

# 1. Introducing The Basics

You may already be familiar with the pike pushup (the number 1 exercise to build a foundation for the HSPU) but it’s worth reviewing it as to reap most of the benefits you want to have perfect form.

If you want to go deeper with pike pushup form I recommend you to check out Antranik's reddit & blog post.

&#x200B;

These are the main points:

* **Lean forward** as much as possible when going down. If you don’t get into the habit of leaning forward you will never balance the free HSPU, plus you’ll be hitting more the upper chest which is always nice).
* Keep you **forearms vertical** or perpendicular to the ground. A signal that you’re not leaning forward enough is having the forearms pointing backwards. This again will hinder your balance on the future as it will put your center of gravity behind your hands.
* Keep a **45º angle** between your uppers arms and torso (in other words, tuck your elbows). When your upper arms are too close to your torso you make the movement too triceps dependent and you can’t leverage as good the force of your chest. But when your upper arms are too far from your torso you’ll put yourself in a more unstable position. So aim for a 45º upper arm - torso angle for a good combination of force and control.
* Lastly if you want perfect form, **open your shoulders** when you reach the top position. Most people shoulder position at the top looks more like a pushup than a handstand. Try getting in the habit of finishing the move with your arms in line with the upper part of your spine. At this point don’t worry about your forearms pointing backwards.

&#x200B;

With that being said I recommend you then to train the Pike Pushup once a week for at least six weeks:

* Pike Pushups for 5 sets of 4 to 6 reps, tempo of 4s down and 1s up and at least 2 minutes rest.

Here the goal is to practice the proper movement pattern following the previous points while building a good base of strength.

# 2. Scaling The Basics

So as most people I started bodyweight training to improve my physique, so I was mostly doing sets of more than 8 reps. But at some point I started to obses more about strength and skills and at that point I realized I was taking it too far in the other direction.

&#x200B;

When I first was training more for strength and skills I was doing everytime low reps with too high intensity. After a while I got stuck in plateaus and my joints were screaming me to stop. I was definitely missing some conditioning and muscle.

&#x200B;

That’s why in the second step I want you to take a step back and do some higher rep work for muscle and conditioning as now you’ve already mastered the movement pattern of the pike pushup:

* Pike Pushups for 4 sets 10 to 14 reps, tempo of 2s down and 1s up and 1 minute rest.

As in the first step, doing this exercise once a week for 6 weeks is good enough for most people.

# 3. Leveling Up The Progression

At this point you want to level up the pike pushup progression. Doing a handstand pushup at the wall would be still too challenging. Maybe you could do few back to wall HSPU if you’ve low bodyweight but I don’t really like back to wall as it makes the “forward lean” cue virtually impossible.

&#x200B;

So the best exercise here is the L Pike Pushup. The same points from the regular pike pushup apply but now you’ll do them with your feet elevated. This will be closer to a chest to wall handstand pushup but less intense.

* L Pike Pushups for 4 sets of 5 to 8 reps, tempo of 4s down and 1s up and at least 2 minutes rest.

&#x200B;

If that’s still too hard I recommend you to limit your range of motion. On the other hand, you can use parallettes or a step to increase the ROM and make it harder.

But the key is to always track what’s your current ROM as that way you’ll make sure that you’re progressively increasing the intensity which is the name of the game.

# 4. Mastering The Foundation

On the last step I’ll introduce you to what has been for me the key to unlock both HSPU and bent arm press handstand: The Pike Pushup Plus.

&#x200B;

Aside from doing the pike pushup plus, you’ll also be doing regular pike pushups for conditioning / hypertrophy.

So this time I recommend you to have two calisthenics workouts per week. One with skills (pike pushup plus) and one for conditioning (high rep pike pushups).

* Day 1. Pike Pushups Plus for 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps, tempo of 4s down and 1s up and at least 2 minutes rest (use rest pause between reps if needed).
* Day 2. Pike Pushups for 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps, tempo of 2s down and 1s up and 1 minute rest.

&#x200B;

For the Pike Pushup Plus you follow the same points as for the regular pike pushups but with one difference:

* Once you reach the bottom position you lift your feet from the ground for a second or two and you drop them down to the floor.

&#x200B;

Here the key is to lift your feet without extending your elbows. That would be too much at this point as doing this would mean you are already doing a bent arm press handstand.

So once you’re lifting your feet focus on holding that bottom position with your elbows bent while leaning forward. This one thing will be priceless when it comes to unlocking the free HSPU and the bent arm press handstand.

&#x200B;

# Summary (TLDR)

These are the exercises that you want to be focusing on each step to build an excellent foundation for the HSPU (links to video demonstration on each exercise):

&#x200B;

1. [Pike Pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3sc1-QNuG8&t=34s) for 5 sets of 4 to 6 reps, tempo of 4s down and 1s up and at least 2 minutes rest.
2. [Pike Pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3sc1-QNuG8&t=3m29s) for 4 sets of10 to 14 reps, tempo of 2s down and 1s up and 1 minute rest.
3. [L Pike Pushups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3sc1-QNuG8&t=4m28s) for 4 sets of 5 to 8 reps, tempo of 4s down and 1s up and at least 2 minutes rest.
4. Day 1 - [Pike Pushups Plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3sc1-QNuG8&t=5m25s) for 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps, tempo of 4s down and 1s up and at least 2 minutes rest (use rest pause between reps if needed). Day 2 - Pike Pushups for 3 sets 10 to 12 reps, tempo of 2s down and 1s up and 1 minute rest.

&#x200B;

I really recommend you to go for it as the HSPU is one of the most fun and badass exercises. It’s cool to get stronger and bigger but if you can add the body control on top of that you’ll experience what for me is true fitness.

Finally, big thanks to Tom Merrick for sharing with me this awesome progressions.

Introducing Bodyweight Fitness (/r/bodyweightfitness) Mobile App,mazurio,1156,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3bmwzf/introducing_bodyweight_fitness_rbodyweightfitness/,1435675361.0,"Hi **guys!**

Introducing **Bodyweight Fitness (formerly Fit for Reddit)**, a **mobile app** created for /r/bodyweightfitness. Bodyweight Fitness is an **open source**, **free** and **no adverts** mobile application for **Android** and **iOS** (Work in Progress, 2 - 3 weeks).


I have started working on this app couple of months ago but because of personal reasons I had to stop and focus on work and family. Less than a week ago, I decided to finish it as you can see from [this comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3b658h/fitloopco_goes_open_source/csjadph)


The inspiration for this app is /u/imanateater amazing Fitloop. I have discovered this subreddit months ago (Or even years now) but started working out after Fitloop helped me to understand the routine.


Today I want to bring this contribution forward and present you the application, here is an album presenting how it looks like at th emoment:


http://imgur.com/a/tWSDu


The app is not meant to replace fitloop! Don't get me wrong, I love fitloop and what /u/imanateater did. My goal is to talk to /u/imanateater and see how in next few months we can work together to create a login/signup in the app that uses fitloop credentials etc.


The app is Open Source but at the moment source is out of date. Going to push Android Code tomorrow, iOS is currently in the works and hopefully I can finish it in next 2 weeks. I also have to choose apropriate license.


**GitHub:**


https://github.com/mazurio/bodyweight-fitness-android
https://github.com/mazurio/bodyweight-fitness-ios


**Download Android:**


**Free:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bodyweight.fitness.free


**Pro / Donation (£1.99 / $2.49):** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bodyweight.fitness.pro


**Download iOS:**


** Free & (Donation In-App-Purchase)** https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bodyweight-fitness/id1018863605


**Where is the money from Pro version going?**


As you know fitloop is sponsored by links to Amazon as /u/imanateater does not accept donations.

I have chosen to create Pro version as a form of donation. I hate having adverts in the app and I think it destroys the design and user experience. Both Free and Pro versions will always (ALWAYS) be the same when it comes to functionality. This is purely done to accept some kind of donation that is not too much.

Part of the money would go towards Apple Developer License for one year which is £79. I haven't published anything on iOS yet so this is going to be one of the costs in next few weeks.

As I love this subreddit and it's community, I am going to be honest. My ultimate goal is to be able to gather some money for an engagement ring for my amazing girlfriend. I know she will never read this post so I am free to say it.


**What about bugs?**


Please report anything you can find by private message on reddit /u/mazurio

Otherwise you can use email that can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/mazurio


**What is coming next?**


I want to keep the app simple but add features over time, here is the timeline.

* Android Wear Support.

* Each exercise in the app will also link to Fitloop for more information and YouTube video. As you can see, those Gifs are simple but not perfect. Most of the videos are more than 10 minutes long with explanations.

* Ability to hide videos and change layout of the app (some people want to see the timer but not the video).

* Log your workouts (I can either make it simple like fitloop or add overall time from each workout).

* Notifications, this is 90% done as this was one of the first features I have started working on. You will be able to choose notifications you can get through weeks (e.g. Set my Workout days to Monday/Wednesday/Friday and get reminders). It will also remind abuot /r/bodyweightfitness specific events such as Moronic Monday etc.

* More personalisation and settings.

* Maybe me and /u/imanateater can discuss naming apps Fitloop rather than Bodyweight Fitness? What do you guys think?

* I am not a designer and I think logo at the moment looks quite bad. I would love to see someone make a contribution and create a nice, material logo for both iOS and Android versions.

* Create your own routines, modify existing routines. This is just an idea for now but it also depends on what /u/imanateater says.


Please tell me what do you guys think, I will keep working on the apps for both Android and iOS as I really enjoy it.


Those apps are created for this community, please read the comment from /u/Antranik [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3b658h/fitloopco_goes_open_source/csjmqmo)


I would love to see this sub participate in their own open source project to make things even better.

Hope you love it,
**mazurio**


**Too perfect to be true**


Google has reject ""Fit for Reddit"" logo and name so I have rebranded it quickly so I can release it today (now it's called Bodyweight Fitness), I really hope /u/imanateater can agree so apps would be called Fitloop. Can a good redditor come up with a new, good looking logo?




**EDIT**

As of today (13th July), iOS version of the application is DONE and is going to be submitted into the store in couple of hours. It usually takes around 9 days to get approved so fingers crossed.

Also Android Update is coming out today!

**iOS is out:**

My Anterior Pelvic Tilt Routine (Full Program Write Up and Video),berimbolosforsatan,1152,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/p61w6j/my_anterior_pelvic_tilt_routine_full_program/,1629199747.0," I've created a 10 minute program to fix your lower back pain and poor posture forever. And did I mention its only 10 minutes a day?

It is ubiquitous throughout our day: sitting at work, sitting at home or sitting driving. The fact of the matter is that we can't get rid of sitting completely, so we just have to come up with a way to mitigate the damage it is causing to our posture. 
# Lower Crossed Syndrome

What is it about sitting that causes back pain? When we are sitting, our hip flexors are in a shortened position. Over time they become hypertonic, in other words tight. This lack of hip flexion mobility can get so bad that you can't even stand up straight without excessively arching your back and can cause tightness in erector spinae or lumbar region of our back, which causes the CNS to inhibit your rectus abdominis, leading to diminished ab strength. Tight hip flexors can also inhibit the function of our glutes, leading to underactive or weak glutes by restricting the range of the glutes to the point they can't even contract optimally. 

When these four symptoms present clinically, it's called lower crossed syndrome. The reason it is lower crossed syndrome is because if we look at a picture and draw connecting lines between the tight areas, and then the weak areas, it results in a cross.

Long story short, lower crossed syndrome can be a major cause of LBP, and it causes APT - which is the tilting of your hips that causes your lower back to arch excessively.  To fix both of these problems we just have to realise that all we have here is a collection of symptoms. If we can address the root cause of each of these symptoms, then we can get rid of back pain permanently! We simply need to mobilise the areas that are lacking mobility and strengthen the areas that are lacking strength.  That's it, and it only takes 10 minutes a day!

As there are essentially two groups, one that lacks mobility and the other that lacks strength, it follows that we can make a program with two parts; one that mobilises and one that strengthens. Looking at the diagram again, we have tight erector spinae, rectus femoris and iliopsoas. Conversely we have weak or inhibited rectus abdominis and both gluteus maximus and medius.  

## Posterior Pelvic Tilt
For the stretch the hip flexor group effectively, we need to familiarise ourselves with the movement of posterior pelvic tilt. It is simply the reverse motion of anterior pelvic tilt, so we need to be able to perform that movement effectively to have any hope of improving anterior pelvic tilt.  Pelvic tilt in either direction is best thought of as changing the curvature of your lower back by rotating your hips one way or the other. Anterior pelvic tilt is increasing the lumbar curvature by this movement and posterior pelvic tilt is decreasing the curvature. 
The first step to learning this movement is laying flat on the floor. You will notice a space between your lower back and the floor. Now, force your lower back down to the floor by squeezing your glutes and rotating your pelvis and tucking your tailbone. If you need tactile feedback, place your hands underneath your lower back. This movement is PPT. Once we have the movement when we are laying  on the floor, we can pro1gress to doing it against a wall using the same ideas, and eventually away from the wall.

Once you have this movement under control, we can stretch the hip flexors effectively.   
***
# The Program
##ILIOPSOAS

To improve our hip flexion mobility, we need to stretch the hip flexors. That much makes sense. Shortened hip flexors pull your hips and spine anteriorly, and result in the lower back muscles on the other side becoming tight and overworked. To release these, we are going to perform two stretches to improve our mobility. We are going to start by stretching iliacus and psoas, which are grouped together and termed iliopsoas. The iliopsoas is in a  shortened position when sitting, and if we sit enough, it will lack the required mobility to stand upright, and pull our spine anteriorly, which results APT. To stretch this, we are going to perform the kneeling hip flexor stretch. How we perform this stretch is critical, and it is commonly performed wrong. First I will show you how to do it incorrectly. When I do it incorrectly, I am simply forcing my lower back to arch excessively, and any stretch I feel at the front of my hip is likely just the joint capsule smashing towards the front of my hip.  To do this correctly, the set up is key: We are looking for a 90 degree angle at the front and back knees, as well as  at the hip. We must be as upright as possible and be able to draw a straight line from our torso to the bottom of our femur.  From here we are going to posteriorly tilt the pelvis as we practised before and squeeze the glute of the trailing leg .

##RECTUS FEMORIS
There is also one of our quadriceps in particular that we need to focus on. For this to make sense, let's have a look at the anatomy of your quads. You have four quads: the vastus group which include lateralis, medialis and intermedius which lies beneath the fourth quad, rectus femoris. The rectus femoris is unique in that it is the only one of your quads to cross both the hip and knee. This means to stretch this muscle effectively, we need to stretch it at both ends. 

To perform this stretch we are going to begin kneeling on the ground and put one shin flat on the wall behind us. You can see immediately that I my femur, or upper leg bone is behind me which lengthens the hip end of the rectus femoris, and the knee is bent which is stretching the knee end. The goal is to rest your back flat on the wall, which requires a decent amount of flexibility. As your flexibilty increases, you will be able to get your torso more and more upright. Again, we need to think about tilting the pelvis posteriorly to get the most out of this stretch, so make sure to squeeze that glute, and tuck your tailbone.

GLUTES
Both the glute max and medius are in need of strengthening. 

##GLUTE MEDIUS
People who are experiencing LBP often exhibit glute medius weakness. If the LBP is on one side, then ipsilateral glute medius weakness is usually present (2)
###CLAMS
To strengthen the glute medius we are going to do the clam. The clam is a great way of training the movement hip external rotation, and if you have an elastic band then it also a fantastic way to progressively overload the muscle. 
Lie on one side with the both legs bent to 45 degrees resting one on top of the other. 
Stack the hips and shoulders directly on top of one another  (imagine being in a sit-up position and rolling over to one side).  Activate the gluteus medius to lift the top leg open, as if opening a clamshell - I don't want to hear any jokes about my pearls either.  Add a Versa Loop band for a greater challenge. 
##GLUTE MAX
The glute max is the largest muscle in our body and looks good to boot. To develop our glute strength we are going to perform the classic glute bridge. The glute bridge is a very effective way of training hip extension, which is one of the glute max's major movements. 
To perform a glute bridge, we are going to place our upper back against a bench, or chair, or even flat on the floor. From here we are going to lift our hips up as high as we can making sure we squeeze our glutes at the top. Seems simple right? Well, not exactly. The problem with this movement is that we can trick ourselves into thinking we are getting into hip extension by merely arching our lower back. This means the glutes are barely working in this movement. To make sure that we are engaging the glutes, you must limit the arching of the lower back and making sure keep our body in a straight position throughout the movement.  The other problem is that the hamstrings are also capable of hip extension, and sometimes they take too much of the work awaay from the glutes. What we can do to counteract this is use Sherrington's Law of Reciprocal Inhibition. This law states that once a muscle contracts, the CNS tells the antagonist to relax. Practically speaking, if I activate my quads, then my CNS tells my hamstrings to relax. So again, in the glute bridge, if I keep my feet flat on the floor but drive my toes into the ground, my quads will contract isometrically, which makes my hamstrings relax. Then the only thing left to hip extension is my glutes. So by contracting the quads in a glute bridge, we can get more glute activation in the movement.

#Rectus Abdominis
The first thing that  you'd probably think of to strengthen  the rectus abdominis is some variation of a sit up or crunch. They can be a good addition to a training program for someone without lower back pain, but for someone with anterior pelvic tilt or lower back pain they are not the best choice. For the specifics of the mechanics of these two exercises, check out my other video on effective ab exercises. Ideally, we do not want to be training isotonic hip flexion as the hip flexors are already tight and overworked. So what we are going to do is to borrow an ab exercise from gymnastics - the hollow body. The good thing about the hollow body is that it isometric, so it is a great way to gain abdominal strength without repetitive hip flexion, like in a sit up. 
##HOLLOW BODY
To perform a hollow body, we are going to begin laying down on the floor with our legs flat on the floor. We are going to lift our feet off the ground and raise our hands until we have a shallow curve in our body. From here, it is critical that we drive our lower back down towards the floor. When we consciously flatten our back against the floor in this position what is actually happening anatomically is that we are posteriorly rotating our pelvis, which if you have forgotten is the opposite movement of anterior pelvic tilt. That's why this exercise is a great addition to a corrective routine because we are training a specific function that we are wanting to improve. Remember, specific adaptation to induced demands - we are strengthening the muscle in a very similar position to that when we are standing - this exercise carries over to our daily life extremely well.
***
So that's it. If you do each of these movements, you are directly targeting the root cause of lower crossed syndrome - which is the thing that is causing your back pain and poor posture in the first place. Looking at the causes behind lower crossed syndrome,  we can see that each of the exercises in the program are there to serve a purpose. Breaking the problem down into a set of smaller problems and attacking each of them we came up with an extremely time effective program. I will link the entire program as a PDF in the description below. If you can commit just 10 minutes a day to this program, your anterior pelvic tilt will begin to improve. Remember that these postural problems have developed over a long period of time, so it is important that you are patient and persistent with these exercises. Just remember long term change requires long term effort.  I've explained the entire program in the attached video and there is a full PDF of this program with timing, reps etc in the description🙂

8 Ways to Sit on the Floor (while improving your mobility at the same time!),Captain_Nachos,1151,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4yu4v1/8_ways_to_sit_on_the_floor_while_improving_your/,1471773006.0,"Hey guys! Nick E here.

#**LINK HERE:** http://www.nick-e.com/floor-sitting/

I just wanted to make a quick little post about different ways to sit on the floor. I've known consciously for a while that sitting in chairs all day isn't very good for you, but recently I've really gone all out in terms of actively sitting on the floor as much as I can at home and it feelsgoodman.

I especially like floorsitting because it is sort of a passive, thoughtless way to improve your mobility which we all need to varying degrees. For example, the most relevant one to BWF is the straddle sit. You are just stretching your pancake flexibility, while sitting! How great is that?

All of us here at /r/bodyweightfitness are actively and consistently working to improve the way we move, but most likely, not a lot of us are working to improve how we rest!

Check it out and let me see what you think :)

I’m 270 im 14 and i need help.,Psychological_Sale66,1145,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qtrdi5/im_270_im_14_and_i_need_help/,1636901538.0,So growing up i was always big. I was always taller then most people my age. My height right now is 5.9 to 5.10. I do always go to the doctors and they try to help but they always tell me the same thing “just eat better and be more active”. I am eating way better then i was before I only and i mean ONLY drink water. Growing up i hated soda I’ve always hated soda and i just never drink it. But starting off i am trying to be more active at school i try my hardest in gym class running around. At home i try to do push ups the max i can do is three. I do sit-ups in my room and do jumping jacks. I really am trying but i feel like im going nowhere. I don’t have the option to going to a gym. And my doctors just only tell me to cut my portions. This is my first time trying to seek help online and just see if someone can help me. My weight isn’t my only issue either to begin with. I’ve always had bad self esteem. And i easily get demotivated and lose the urge to work on myself. I always have the mindset that i can work on myself later or when I’m trying to lose weight that im not heading anywhere. Anyways thanks for reading my situation and really any tips do help.

Routine: I train daily. Sometimes I take 1 day off, but I constantly “Grease the Groove” with doing planche holds/push ups, front levers, back levers, human flags, handstand and HSPU (all throughout the day). And on 3-4 days per week I train pull ups, dips, and push ups. Usually I just max out for 3 sets of each with 5 minute breaks. Sometimes I also do sets of say 15 pull ups every 5-15 mins, same with dips and push ups. Also do muscle ups occasionally, just max reps for a few sets, 10 mins between sets

* Lots of content and features planned for the near future.

**Cali Skills**

Calisthenics Skills has been in development for  9 months, and is developed primarily by myself (in my spare time) with [/u/suhaga15](https://www.reddit.com/u/suhaga15/) also volunteering his expertise.

The idea came about as I tracked my bodyweight fitness progress on an incredible community-built excel spreadsheet. The exercises on this spreadsheet had all of the exercises laid out like an RPG skill tree, which I loved. This spreadsheet did some other amazing things too like

* Tracking progress in a satisfying way
* Linking to resources for each exercise
* Sharing quality videos created by lesser-known individuals in the calisthenics community.

I wanted to turn the joy I gained from this spreadsheet into a comprehensive calisthenics experience. And I wanted this experience bundled in an app that anyone (even my grandma) could use. That's how Calisthenics Skills was born.

It's taken a while to get to this point where I feel comfortable sharing outside friends and family as a serious app. Previously, I've shared it as a fun little web site, but it's starting to feel like it's more than that, or at least has the potential to be.

It's taken lots of feedback (some pretty hard to listen to), a lot of coding, and lots of learning. But then again, we wouldn't all be on this subreddit if we hated putting in a little hard work!

I've got so many plans for what I'd like this app to be in the future, but I'll leave that as a surprise for all those willing to give it a shot. ;)

Note: I pay for the site hosting costs myself, so I have to make a few concessions to keep this affordable, the most notable being the ability to generate a single workout per day.

I really hope y'all enjoy this.

\*Edit: Specified that Cali Skills is a web app, there's no iPhone/Android app to download. But for a lot of devices, you can save the app to your homescreen.

\*Edit 2: You can check out the skill trees directly via this [link](https://calisthenicsskills.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=07-03-reddit) "
Real-deal prison workout (request),dactyldragon,1139,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/rg1b79/realdeal_prison_workout_request/,1639463637.0,"Hi Hi, 

I am looking for advice on genuine prison workout as I am currently incarcerated. 

- I have time limited access to workout space, maybe 2 hours per day. No pullup bar, but a small concrete step is available. 

- I have limited space for cardio activities (maybe 20m x 50m).

- No mat available and the ground is raw concrete. 

Note: It is Difficult to plan a schedule as i do not have access to these spaces when it rains

Additional Equipment i can access (i realise it is not exactly in the spirit of bodyweightfitness, but I thought I would include it. 
2 concrete weights around 7kg
1 concrete barbell around 20kg

Diet: 
I dont have much choice in this

- Rice 3x a day
- Some vegetables
- Limited meat
- Limited eggs
- Sweet breads on request
- (I could request some additional food or supplements if recommended) 

I fast from sunrise to sunset every Monday and Thursday



Goals:

- Practical strength
- Improve lower back strength and mobility (old climbing injury) 
- Maintain condition for rock climbing
- Avoid becoming fat
- improvement in taekwondo training
- Emotional and psychological wellbeing

I have a four year sentence and lots of free time. A great opportunity to get into excellent shape. 


I have a daily regimen of yoga and stretching... But it is a bit dull and i would also appreciate any advice or recommendations regarding this. 

I was previously running about 5km every day and strength training 3x per week. I was also a casual rock climber, going bouldering approximately 1x per week. Unfortunately, none of these skills helped me when i was arrested, hehehe. 

Thank you. If anyone is interested I can keep an update of my regimen and its effects. 

Stay healthy out there!"
Low intensity workout for someone with depression,katiekattttt,1135,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kpnlpx/low_intensity_workout_for_someone_with_depression/,1609691699.0,"Hi all,

Since I’m currently so inactive, I tend to pull muscles when I’m doing everyday activities, such as reaching across the table to get something just out of reach.

I have no equipment and want to get started with a workout now, so I can’t do any exercises that use ANY equipment (besides a yoga mat).

I am very weak and get overwhelmed easily, so I want exercises that are very easy and won’t make me exhausted or super sore. Just something to get me started and feeling good about myself. Feeling sore for days after will make it really hard to continue working out because of my depression, even if it’s just soreness after the first workout or two.

I am not trying to build muscle, lose/gain weight, or change my looks in any way.

What kind of basic, easy exercises can I do to help keep me from pulling muscles, improve my energy a little, and not make me exhausted/super sore?

I’m a 150 lb, average height, mid-twenties female, in case it’s relevant.

Thanks in advance."
Hit a milestone yesterday: went from 0 to 10 clean pull ups in 5 months of the RR. Thought I'd never get there. Thanks BWF!,danenania,1135,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ep6j44/hit_a_milestone_yesterday_went_from_0_to_10_clean/,1579114475.0,"I wanted to post this mainly for the benefit of those who might be just starting out or are maybe 2 or 3 months in and feeling like they're not getting anywhere. I finally got to 10 clean pull ups, a goal I've had since getting consistent with the RR back in September. This goal felt impossibly far away until all of a sudden it wasn't. Getting to 5 was \*very\* slow (\~3.5 months) but then 5 to 10 went surprisingly fast. I've made some good progress in the other exercises too, but always felt like pull ups were the white whale.

I'm 34, male, 5'9.5"". Was \~147 lbs, now 160. I began in pretty good aerobic shape from running and some swimming, but with almost zero upper body strength. I could do 1 or 2 really bad pull ups with help from jumping up, moving body for momentum, not going all the way down/up, etc. If I tried to start from the bottom and do one with really good form I'd just hang there like a desiccated fish.

Things that worked for me/things I've learned:

* Started with mainly chin ups instead of pull ups in the beginning since these were easier.
* Lots of negatives. I'd do as many bad chin ups as I could then switch to pull up negatives until failure.
* Working on grip strength with a crusher and bands for extensors.
* Also have tried to do a lot of hanging ab work (tucks, leg raises, etc.) to further work on grip and shoulder strength.
* After my biceps strengthened a bit and no longer felt totally blasted after chin ups, I started mixing in some bicep curls with dumbbells--regular curls, reverse curls, and hammer curls. This seemed to help a \*lot\*. Also started doing some bent over dumbbell rows occasionally (alternating with inverted rows) to work the lats a different way, and that's been effective too.
* Tried to mix it up occasionally with rings and tree branches instead of just the usual straight bar.
* Taking more rest days than are typically recommended. When I try to only do 1 day off in between workouts, I seem to inevitably get injured--I've had 3 separate bouts of rotator cuff tendonitis that required taking a week or two off. I now take two or three days between workouts by default and seem to have faster progress this way.
* Something I feel is \*very\* important to come to terms with as a noob is just how hideously bad your form is going to be at first, and how much harder any exercise is if you do it with truly good form. It's frustrating to feel like you're ""improving"" when you start increasing the number of reps you can do with terrible form, only to see the gains disappear when you make an effort to fix your form. You might fight your way up to 5 bad pull ups, then realize you can only do 1 or 2 with better form, and that's quite discouraging. But it's a necessary part of the process and something you should expect to go through a few cycles of.

Thanks to the veterans here and the authors of the RR especially. And godspeed to all my fellow noobs!"

Nobody seems to have issue finding / getting steroids, once they decide they want them. We’re talking like, teens. Kids. It’s not that hard for them. 

Aren’t steroids supposed to be highly regulated in The US? Both prescription wise and just buying the shit to make them if you wanted them?

Asking because I know there are probably some people on here who do them, or know people who do, or in short know more about this then I do. People often like it’s so easy to get steroids...how? 

Where is everyone getting all these steroids from?

# Blood Tests #

Doctor’s comment for April 2018 blood test…

> Your blood chemistry results, cholesterol levels and kidney function and liver enzymes were all normal. Your white blood cell count and platelet count were just below the normal range but it would seem unlikely those were due to diet. Do you have any previous labs for comparison, it is possible these are your normals for those tests but hard to know if you have no prior results to compare. These results would not produce any symptoms at this level.

Doctor’s comment for April 2019 blood test…

> I am pleased to let you know that your recent labs were normal. Your HIV lab also showed no infection. Your “t bili” was ever so slightly elevated though not significant in this context. Your other liver function labs were normal. Please let me know if you have any further questions about them.

**_No blood test taken for 2020 due to Coronavirus._**

# FAQ #

## Why are you only drinking meal replacement shakes? ##

A few years ago, I kept coming across news articles of people doing 30-day challenges with these new meal replacement products that claim to provide 100% RDI. That piqued my curiosity, and I wanted to experiment with it myself.

I lost ten pounds the first month. Excited about the progress, I wanted to keep going. What was meant as a 30-day experiment turned into a long-term habit. I’ve been on this diet for more than 3 years now and still going.

My main motivation is still curiosity. I think it’s a worthwhile goal to help determine the minimum system requirements humans need to operate. So by eating according to current RDI every day for a long time, I can see if I become toxic or deficient in any areas and we can adjust our knowledge.

## Which meal replacement are you using? ##

I use a product called Plenny Shake. I chose it mainly because of price. It also has a variety of flavors (mango is my favorite) and is plant based (lactose free).

Some other popular brands I considered were Soylent, Huel, and Queal.

To get my serving size and how much a meal will cost me, I used an online calorie calculator.

I kept the powder and water in separate bottles and mixed on demand. I used a food scale to consistently measure my meal sizes. I had to use a larger shaker bottle since my 1333 calorie meals didn’t fit in the free shaker bottle that came with my first Plenny Shake order.

## Did you take any supplements? ##

No supplements, drugs, alcohol, caffeine, snacks, cheat days. Just the powder and water.

## How did you measure your body fat? ##

I got one of those home body fat scales that use bioelectrical impedance. I know it’s not the most accurate, but it gives me a pretty good estimate. I tried to measure myself each time with similar conditions (right after waking up and using the restroom).

If my weight and body fat stays about the same for 3 to 4 weeks straight, I increase or decrease my calories by 10% depending on if I’m bulking or cutting.

## When are you going to eat regular food again? What will be your first meal? ##

I don’t plan on doing it forever. I think I’ll go 4 years max. I read an article that says it takes about 4-5 years to reach your natural fitness limit. After 4 years, I’ll probably still use meal replacements, but not 100%.

My first meal will probably be Hawaiian poke.

## What advantages have you experienced with this diet? ##

The biggest advantage about an all meal replacement diet is the convenience. Three major conveniences are:

1. Time
2. Money
3. Calorie tracking

In regards to time and money, I spend less than 30 minutes a day doing food-related things (meal prep, consuming, clean up). There is no traveling to get food, no waiting in line, no refrigeration, no cooking, and no wasted leftovers.

It is way cheaper than my previous diet that consisted of cereal, fast/frozen food, snacks, and home cooked Filipino dishes.

Also, I stay in my vehicle part time when I am far from home for several days, and powdered food has been a godsend in that situation.

With regards to calorie tracking, it’s stupidly easy to keep track of calories when you eat the same thing every day. Losing/gaining/maintaining weight is all about calorie management.

Being confident that I can control my weight at will is a great superpower I’ve gained since experimenting with this diet.

## What negatives have you experienced with this diet? ##

The biggest negative thing about this diet is the social aspect. Sharing meals is a bonding experience for most people, so I miss that part.  It is a bit awkward going out with friends, and I’m just drinking water while they are eating and getting drunk.   Also, people get disappointed when I deny food that they are offering especially if they cooked it.

## How do you handle cravings? ##

The first couple weeks was hard. But like most things, you get used to it after awhile. I went to bed hungry and woke up feeling not hungry which to me seems like my body was burning stored fat instead of recently eaten food when I went to sleep.

I experimented with intermittent fasting also which helped me control cravings.  I am able to do a 20 hour fast with a 4 hour eating window comfortably.  Most days though, I’m on a more conservative 14 hour fast with a 10 hour eating window.

It’s become so routine to me now that it’s just something I do like brush my teeth or take a shower. Not a lot of thought goes into it anymore.

I treat it more like a prescription… “Take three of these shakes a day to control your weight and stay alive. Adjust the dosage as needed”.

Products like these are the closest thing to simply popping a pill to give your body the fuel it needs to function.

## How is your energy level? ##

Energy level during cutting was noticeably lower than when bulking, but that’s the same with normal food as well.

As of now, I’ve never felt this fit in my entire life.  I don’t use caffeine and am able to keep up with my kids while working graveyard.

Also, I haven’t experienced any kind of brain fog or headaches.  I still feel sharp and enjoy learning challenging new things.

## What other physical activities do you do? ##

For my job, I walk around for about an hour. At home, I take care of my little kids. Other than that, no other major physical activity.

## What is your fitness goal? ##

My next milestone I'd like to reach is a FFMI of 23 which would have me at 215 lbs with 15% body fat. I think I can reach that by continuing to do what I've been doing.

## How are your bowel movements? ##

Skip this part if you don’t like reading about poop.

Before this diet, I was often constipated.  Now, I have a bowel movement at least once a day, and it goes out easily.  If I go right when I feel the urge, it comes out like soft serve ice cream. If I hold it for a long time, it comes out like logs.

Plenny Shake changed their formula in the middle of my experiment to contain less protein.  After the change, I noticed a vast improvement in the condition of my bowels.  I had far less gas and bloating, the poop doesn’t leave skid marks or clog the toilet anymore, and the smell no longer clears the room.

## What is the condition of your mouth? ##

I still stimulate my teeth and gums by chewing gum after every meal and brushing/flossing every day.  The condition of my mouth actually improved.  I get far less canker sores than I used to and my breath got better also.

## How do people around you react? ##

When people first hear about my diet, their knee-jerk reaction is usually disbelief. They can’t imagine something like this can be healthy or sustainable. However, after sharing my progress pics and blood test, they start getting interested. I’ve gotten quite a few people to incorporate modern meal replacements as part of their diet after they saw my results.

## Is someone paying you to do this? ##

No one is paying me to be on a 100% meal replacement diet. I consider myself an independent researcher, and I am meal replacement agnostic. If a more affordable one came out that still provides 100% RDI and can be delivered monthly to me consistently, I’d switch brands in a heartbeat.

## What advice do you have for someone who wants to try this diet and exercise routine? ##

My advice to people curious about trying such a diet would be to start off gradually.

Order a sample of different brands and flavors to see which one agrees with you the best. Then, replace one meal a day at first. When you are used to that, replace another meal and so on until all your meals are replaced.

Try it for 30 days straight, and I think you'll fall in love with the convenience. After that, you don't need to be 100% like me unless you want to help with the sample size of testing if our current RDI is accurate.

Most people will just want to use it to replace meals when they are busy. It's perfect for your boring and routine meals. You can save the other meals for special occasions with friends and family. Then you can just use a calorie tracking app like MyFitnessPal to make sure the other foods are kept in your daily calorie goal. 

For the exercise, I think keeping it short and simple is key into being consistent and will help people make exercise a lasting habit.  When you can do 2 short workouts a week consistently, then consider adding more exercise if you want.

The shortest path to a goal is a straight line. You can use this diet and exercise as a tool to quickly reach your desired weight.  It doesn't get much simpler than 1 food and 1 hour of exercise a week."
A word of advice if you decide to make your own pull up bar.,ilmattoh,1133,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fqj222/a_word_of_advice_if_you_decide_to_make_your_own/,1585397537.0,"The other day I was talking with my dad about the homemade pull up bars I was seeing here on Reddit and, being an engineer, he pointed out to me the difference between static load and dynamic load, because even if something has an high static load rating, the dynamic one could very well be (much) lower.

What I'm trying to say is that you should always take the dynamic load into account too: even if you put a bit of swing on the bar, if you do a skin the cat etc you are going to produce force on the bar in a different way from a simple dead weight.

 As an example, I recently bought a half-rack with a pull up bar rated only 150kg for the user - while the value may seem low, the rating is for the dynamic load, so it's safe enough for the moment.

There are people here who will be able to explain the concept much better than me -- but I hope this can help you stay safer!"
I strength trained 1x per week and 7x per week for 5 months each.,RemainMindful,1133,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/vfj5ax/i_strength_trained_1x_per_week_and_7x_per_week/,1655598448.0,"I figured I'd share because I learned a lot.

**The reason:** Trying to save time and maintain strength during what I knew would be a relatively busy season of life: buying a house and 1st year as an in-person teacher (no mute button)

**The methods:**

Note: I am a 28 yr old male. 5”8’. 143lbs. I don’t know my body fat percentage, but I look like someone who works out because I do. My weight stayed the same through all of this.

Once a week routine (Referred to as “1x” from here on out):

* Mindful Mover’s [big 5 movements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyawYQ30qmY) with two modifications: Overhead press (in lieu of HSPU) and no weights on the 1 leg squats
* [Accommodating Resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNiBxvAs634) on [Pull Ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzbCFanwKLQ), [Push Ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFBE3HPIYic), and [Rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pewFRDEDNtQ)
* 2 sets per movement. The last is a drop set.
* High intensity interval training on an elliptical once per week.

Daily routine (Referred to as “7x” from here on out):

* Influenced by [K Boges](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kbogea) but to a lesser extent than 1x was influenced by Mindful Mover
* Over the course of one month, I slowly worked up to 7 one leg squats, 7 pull ups (4 wide, then 3 hammer), 14 push ups (2 sets of 7, occasionally combined), 14 resistance band rows, 14 OH presses (15 lbs).
* Burnouts: If I felt like going hard, I’d choose a movement and go to town. I didn’t do another burnout session on the same movement until all the others had a turn. Sometimes, my run was the burnout. Sometimes, I skipped an exercise if I did a burnout on it the day prior.

Common to both routines:

* Daily light exercise: 20 min jog (very slow), skydivers, hollow body leg lifts, general arm movement (arm circles, etc.). (sometimes I nixed all of this and just walked the day after a 1x workout.)
* I did the routines for about 4 or 5 months each. 1x-August through December. 7x-January through May.
* Lightly [Stretch](https://imgur.com/a/E2gooya) for 10 minutes before bed.

**Comparisons:**

In terms of saving time, both routines came out to about 60-90 minutes of strength per week. They each had their own pros and cons related to time efficiency. 1x requires more set up, but you do it less often. 7x is best done with minimal gear because the frequency is so high. 5 minutes of set up/tear down per session means 35 minutes a week. That’s non trivial.

Rest time between sets worked in a similar way: I needed more rest between sets with 1x, but I could afford to take it because of the low frequency. I didn’t need any rest between exercises for the 7x routine unless I was feeling really crummy. For both routines, I did exercises in pairs to reduce time spent resting.

1x requires more of a warm up or at least gradually increasing intensity before the working sets. The lower intensity of 7x meant I could tack it onto the end of my daily light exercise and not have to warm up.

I ended up maintaining strength and muscle with 1x, but 7x surpassed my expectations and made me a little stronger. The largest factor in this is motivation. Both routines take a different kind of personal discipline: 1x requires me to push through intense discomfort while 7x requires me to hold back when I want to do more. I personally have a natural inclination for the latter. I could see people with different personalities enjoying 1x more.

This is not to say that 7x is *all* about holding back: I had days where I got home and really didn’t feel like working out. Habits helped me stay consistent on those days: 7x quickly became a part of daily life. The lower frequency of 1x kept it from ever feeling like business as usual.

In fact, I didn’t really plan to switch to 7x after a few months of 1x. I just realized that optimizing for time reduction doesn’t capture the whole picture; I wondered what it might look like to optimize for effort reduction.

7x allowed for autoregulation. Sometimes, weeks passed and I never felt like doing a burnout so I didn’t. I suspect my body actually needed it. There were also weeks where I did several burnouts. To be fair, you can autoregulate by pushing a 1x session back a day or two if you’re not feeling it. However, that requires weekend warriors to do their session on a weekday.

7x afforded me more flexibility. Some days, I did skip my 7x workout because of time restraints or my personal discipline failed. It did not hinder progress in the same way as slacking off just a little bit during a 1x workout seemed to. I could also be flexible with the exercises themselves: For example, I don’t like high bear crawls as much as overhead press, but sometimes I really wanted to workout outdoors so I made the substitution and got right back to overhead press the next day.

It’s kind of satisfying being sore for several days after a 1x session, but I prefer being ready for unplanned physical endeavors in the way that 7x lets me. Even after a burnout session, I only feel a little soreness just because my body is more used to it. I also feel like the high frequency improved my general coordination-I’m simply more used to moving my body around in various ways so the physical tasks of everyday life seem easier.

There are also disadvantages to 7x: generally, I found it easier to injure myself, but **YMMV**. If I push myself too hard, it's just a matter of time, and I found it easy to push myself too hard. On the other hand, if I can’t muster up the grit to push hard enough through that accommodating resistance exercise with 1x, I just don’t make gains. (Edit: I gave more detail in a replies to comments about this but don't want to make this post even longer by including them.)

Also, while 7x worked better for me, it’s important to note the following: I had significantly more stress from work in the fall than in the spring, I am a sample size of one, I wasn’t rigorous in tracking results, and there may have been some user error with 1x. I’d like to know if any user error sticks out.

**Commonalities:**

Both methods improved my form in their own ways. I learned about accommodating resistance through the mindful mover, and it really is a beautiful thing. I absolutely love the [arc row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pewFRDEDNtQ) and continued using it as a burnout in my 7x sessions (it’s too tough on the elbows for every day, though). 7x simply gave me more non-fatigued practice. Also, I felt I was *limiting* my reps most days. That means consistently trying to squeeze all the juice out of each one, building really good form habits.

Both methods helped eliminate decision fatigue during a stressful season of life. For me, the 3 workouts per week that are typically recommended are harder to schedule in than either of the methods I tried.

Both methods taught me how little I can do and get away with it. There’s a certain faith I had to have to take 6 days off of strength work in between sessions. That’s a good mental exercise for life in general-wisdom gains. The same goes for that first month of 7x where I slowly ramped up from 2 pull ups a day to 7 without any burnout sessions. It often felt too easy.

TLDR:

* They both worked well-each with its own pros and cons
* 7x worked a little better for me in my particular situation
* I learned I don’t need to work a muscle intensely nearly as often as I thought.
* Go check out the Mindful Mover and K Boges. They ask good questions and raise good points."
I wrote this guide on how to lower your fitness age,hiphellec,1132,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a7m5ct/i_wrote_this_guide_on_how_to_lower_your_fitness/,1545224007.0,"You  are only as old as you think…or at least act. When it comes to  your  fitness age you can be over 50 or 60 and yet have the ability of   someone in their 20’s, if you go about it the right way.

There  are a few components to remaining physically young and no one  thing is  better or more important than the other. But put them together  and  your health, quality of life, and your appearance will thank you for   years to come.

**Cardiovascular Capacity (aka VO2max)**

A  study in 2007 carried out by Ulrik Wisløff, Ph.D, a professor of   exercise physiology in Norway developed an algorithm to calculate one’s   age in terms of their fitness level (which, sorry, doesn’t actually   change your real age).

The  study centred around one’s cardiovascular capacity, weight,  waistline,  leisure activity and gender to calculate your fitness age.

The  studies Dr. Wisløff initially performed were part of a follow up  to  the initial study, which began in 1980 (the HUNT study), involving   37,000 individuals.

What  they discovered was no surprise. Those who were fitter lived  longer.  In fact, they calculated the degree to which one’s fitness  lowered  one’s risk of heart disease.

**Takeaways:**

It’s not enough to just lift weights and do moderate cardio

High-intensity  cardio such as HIIT (think Boot Camp, Intervals,  Tabata) is a  necessary part of your training regimen as it’s the most  efficient way  to increase your VO2max

Take Wisløff ‘s test here: [https://www.worldfitnesslevel.org/#/](https://www.worldfitnesslevel.org/#/)

**Basic Strength**

But  cardio alone is not the only protection against aging and related   maladies. A study published in 2015 in The Lancet tested grip strength   on 140,000 adults ranging in age from 35 to 70.

The  results showed that a 5kg (or 11lbs) decline in hand strength was   associated with a 17% increased risk of heart attack or stroke.

Why? Hand strength was a great predictor of overall muscle loss.

Grip  strength was also a good indicator of loss of mobility. A study  done  in 2014 by The Journal of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences  and  Medical Sciences concluded that significant reductions in grip   strength coincided with significant reductions in mobility.

This  is not rocket science by any means, if you are inactive it is  not  surprising that you will get weaker and stiffer as you age.

The  great news is that this is easily preventable and gains in  strength  and mobility have been see in people in their 80’s and 90’s.

**Takeaways:**

You do also have to work your basic power with heavy lifts such as farmers walks, deadlifts, and squats

Squats  and deadlifts are complex exercises that require proper  coaching. You  need to have good form and sufficient mobility to avoid  injury. Get at  least a couple of personal training sessions with a  reputable trainer  to go over the basics of these two lifts

See more on squats here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOIJ\_WkCGh8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOIJ_WkCGh8)

Side note: Squats and deadlifts have also been shown to be two of the best core exercises ever

**Bodyweight Strength**

Not  all strength is developed from any strength exercise. Just  because you  are great at weights doesn’t mean you will be good at  bodyweight  exercises. Managing your bodyweight requires a balanced  overall body  strength, which is important since many injuries are  related to  strength imbalances between opposing muscle groups.

**Takeaways:**

Push  Ups, Pull Ups, Squats, and Planks are all basics that should be  in  your workout routine (or be building up to them in some form)

Maybe you’ve never done a pull up before. People at advanced ages have learned to do it and so can you.

**Co-ordinated Exercise**

In  the book Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the   Brain by John J. Ratey, Ratey revealed that science has proven that   exercise can actually re-grow cells in the brain which previously was   thought to be impossible.

Even  more interesting was that exercise, requiring new levels of   co-ordination was even better at contributing to brain cell growth.

**Takeaways:**

Try new things in exercise, not only new exercises but new skills altogether

If you are learning a new skill, coaching is important. The more complex the new skill, the more of a need for a good coach.

Great  examples of skilled exercise: martial arts, golf, Olympic  lifting,  Kettlebells, and basic gymnastics (hand-walking, bridges on  hands etc.)

**Mobility / Flexibility**

Separate  studies done by the University of North Dakota and Castelo  Branco  University in Brazil showed that weightlifting (with proper form)  was  just as good as static stretching for improving mobility.

It  is not surprising as top-level Olympic lifters are incredibly   flexible. Learning how to squat to full depth and overhead squat to   full-depth require tremendous flexibility.

The  great news is that you don’t have to wait for your flexibility to   improve to do these exercises. Rather, do exercises that require   flexibility to the best of your abilities within your current range of   motion. This will act as a stretch as well as tone and build muscle.

As  time goes on you will see your flexibility and range of motion in   these exercises improve as you slowly and gradually test your depth   while maintaining good form throughout the movement.

**Takeaways:**

Learn to box squat well and every few weeks lower the box height by an inch until you no longer need the box at all.

Do the same approach with the overhead squat

Keep your weights light, even just the bar will do, focus on form and depth

Go  slow through these movements, that will require control and  develop  strength in the deeper part of the movements where you need it  most

**Putting It All Together**

To  defy aging you want to have a little bit of everything in your   training regime; some high-intensity cardio, some power exercises, some   bodyweight movements, and some mobility work.

A good routine would have you exercising 3 to 4 days a week as follows:

* A good HIIT routine can be anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes
* Power workouts tend to be slower with more rest periods so they can take 45 minutes to over an hour
* Try 2 HIIT and 1 - 2 Power workouts per week
* Mobility work can be part of either routine by choosing exercises that work your flexibility
* Incorporate  body weight exercises in both your HIIT and power  workouts and you  will have all you need to keep your fitness age low

A balanced routine is the route to a youthful life, good health, and longevity.

I designed a map with progression trees for most popular bodyweight exercises,timv_simg,1133,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/14p9ru8/i_designed_a_map_with_progression_trees_for_most/,1688361591.0,"I created a map for beginners that encompass the majority of bodyweight and calisthenics movements that we see on this sub. 
  
It has around 110 exercises/movements with 5 starting points: Pull, Push, Core, Legs and Skills.

Link to 4096x4096 image:
  
https://i.ibb.co/N1h6ZdC/Bodyweight-Exercises-Map.png
  
My aim when designing this map was to make it as simple as possible and include only comprehensive and safe progressions. Progressions that I have used, or I will recommend my friends to use. 
But, due to simplified nature of this graphic you will notice some inconsistencies, let me know if there is something you really disagree with.
  

Some notes:

* There are a few common exercises that are not present in the map: human flag, bridge

* It does not focus on ""impossible"" or gymnast level movements.

* Mobility / flexibility requirements are not present in this map.

* Relative difficulty between skill trees is not accurate: Weighted Pistol Squats are not the same difficulty as Straddle Planche :)
  

  
Note:
  
I am building an iOS/Android app based on this concept! Goals, progressions, achievements... If this is your sort of thing let me know, I am looking for someone that could help me test it.

1.5 Year Progress with Bodyweight,None,1120,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nuu84h/15_year_progress_with_bodyweight/,1623119595.0,"Was going to post at a year, but I missed that so here’s a year and a half.

I started doing bodyweight fitness exclusively during quarantine because I thought “fuck it I’m home all day anyways and no one will see me struggle so it’s time to put in the work”. I was at 200lbs at my heaviest with nearly no muscle which was very depressing for me mentally. The last year and a half has been life changing. I dropped to 145lbs and my lowest and then started bulking to gain some muscle for more difficult progressions. Currently I’m at 165lbs on a cut and feel strong and comfortable in my body. The change in lifestyle got me to quit drinking and smoking (both of which were major issues I had) and Im making consistently healthier eating choices. Also, I’ve found real enjoyment in learning about the science behind BWF. It’s given me a better understanding about how to progress and something to do in my downtime.

As for actual movements, I’m really proud to have progressed from not being able to do a single pull-up and push-up to a 1RM 60 lbs pull-up and 3x8 RTO push-ups. I’m also doing weighted ring dips, pistol squats, and other fun things. Handstands are slow to progress, and I’m still waiting until I’m a little stronger to work on levers; but I’m excited to see where I’ll go!

Also, I don’t know if anyone has had a similar experience but I felt that I learned “how to do most things wrong” before I learned “how to do most things well”. Originally I was really upset by this but it’s taught me how to feel when I’m doing movements incorrectly/correctly and when I’m making good progress or need to change something.  I’m still learning of course, and reading Overcoming Gravity 2 front to back has really!

Anyways, stay strong and keep making gains! Oh and here are some before and after photos:

Update: Thank you to everyone who liked, commented, and awarded! I didn't expect this post to get nearly the traffic that it did. I'm very honored and glad that I could serve as an inspiration to some people! Since a few have asked in the comments, here is my current RR routine:

1. weighted pull-ups.

2. pistol squats. I add an additional ankle warm-up for these to make sure I mantain perfect form throught my reps. Once I hit 3x8 without my legs caving in for compensation I will start adding weight.

3. weighted ring dips.

4. weighted one leg hamstring slides. This isnt explicitely in the RR but I'm trying to bridge the gap to nordic curls since I made little progress with negatives.

5. tucked front lever hold. Then I'm moving to tucked front lever rows.

6. RTO push-ups. I'm currently working to make sure my rings are turned out as far as possible throughout the entire movement. Then its RTO PPPUs.

7. Knees ab wheel rollout. Will start using a ramp soon to bridge the gap for standing rollouts.

8. Ring pallof press.

9. Hyperextensions. Will start adding weight soon.

Extra. On off days I do skill work involving handstand work, L-sit work, and muscle-up transition work (assisted so I don’t overwork myself). Sundays are true rest days. I also do cardio twice a week on whatever days I feel like. Usually 15-30min."

"In response to Teenagers, looking for Weight-loss Routines",Emmm_Ant2662,1116,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kauacl/in_response_to_teenagers_looking_for_weightloss/,1607655765.0,"I’ve been seeing several posts from teenagers, asking advice for weight loss in this group. I totally understand that because 8 years ago, when I was 15, I did the same thing. I desperately look for the solution to my weight problem.

That itself is not harmless, it comes from a good place of wanting to be healthy. What I’m worried about is that you might end up listening to an adult with bad advice or you might misinterpret a good advice.

- If you eat in a very large calorie deficit with not enough protein, it might even effect your growth. 
.
- Don’t start doing a workout routine that you can’t commit to. Choose something you enjoy. 
.
- Don’t go on Crush Diets. Try not to eliminate Major Food Groups from your diet. 
.
- Be patient with yourself. And celebrate your non-scale victories. (Non- scale achievements can be anything like being able to do 5 pull-ups, being able to go lower on a squat, being able to plank hold longer than before)

- There are a lot of useful posts on r/fitness wiki, that will help you. :)"
"Major Release! The warm-up section of our routine has MANY dynamic mobility stretches and to make it less-overwhelming, I made a follow-along video that strings them ALL together in a revamped, efficient manner! (+ Updates & New Mods!)",Antranik,1107,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4fcig9/major_release_the_warmup_section_of_our_routine/,1460994856.0,"### Full Warm Up Video here: https://youtu.be/8lDC4Ri9zAQ

* In my quest to make the RR easier to follow, this one video will help warmup your shoulders and wrists without having to go through many separate videos. I made it flow efficiently and the pace should be good for beginners just like I did with [the bodyline drills.](https://redd.it/2dkj76)

* Why? Because the warm-up section has always seemed suboptimal to me and I took this as an opportunity to revamp it to make it better and to reflect how I would personally, realistically do it. **Hopefully this makes the routine slightly less daunting or overwhelming for beginners!** This is part of the evolution of the RR.

* [Bonus Bloopers clip](https://youtu.be/9bQ7vGxOVl8) cause reality is cool.

###Minor Updates:

* reorganized the order of exercises (table below)
* added shoulder rolls
* removed full body circles
* removed wall extensions from the general warm up and moved them to the HS page which now has a mobility-section.
* updated links to said exercises
* Added a note to the RR that says, ""The warmup can and should be modified if you have particular 'problem areas' or 'tight areas' that may need special attention.""

# Q&A

### Why did you move the wall extensions to HS page?

* Wall-extensions are specifically helpful for opening the shoulders for HS, so I have moved them to the [HS page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/handstand) and **created a mobility section there.** This year, we will improve the HS section, especially mobility-wise because a myriad of things could help open the shoulders, not just wall extensions.

* Also, most people can't even do wall extensions properly and have to do some sort of regression (either supine with knees up or sit at corner of wall) and that messes with the flow of the warm-up. In this regard, everything in the warm-up are now things everybody should be able to do.

###Why are the full body circles removed?

* The [full-body circles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqmbqBl8BjY) were scrapped because I found out most people do not do them or enjoy them. If you liked them, keep doing them!

###Why are there two new band exercises before the dislocates?

* I've always found it a bit too abrupt to just jump straight into band dislocates. By doing overhead pull downs and chest flies with the band, we better prepare the shoulders for the dislocates.

### What about the leg kicks/swings?

* Bonus! [Here is a video we made for them.](https://youtu.be/AkqakLhh1fI) I did not include these in the other one because we have more refining coming up this year to the RR to have a better lower-body dynamic mobility warmup that focuses on the lower body to better prepare one for squats/leg-work.

### Shout outs and New Mods!

* Big thanks to /u/Wayfaring_Chrononaut for joining me in San Francisco to film this! He is the one who created the [BWF Park Locator Map and the ability for you to submit your own park using google forms!](https://redd.it/3lu96n) Say hello to your new Map Mod!

Looking for an effective DEADLIFT alternative because of CORONA VIRUS LOCKDOWN? Check out BODYWEIGHT HAMSTRING CURLS - The most underrated leg exercise!,pranjayv,1108,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fklqh8/looking_for_an_effective_deadlift_alternative/,1584516885.0,"The Bodyweight Hamstring Curl is one of the most underrated bodyweight leg exercises that no one talks about much. It is a very good option for those who train at home and do not have the proper equipment to do the 'hinge' exercises in the RR or are forced to do bodyweight only workouts at home because gyms are closed due to corona virus. 

People mention this in the beginner daily discussion thread all the time that they are looking for posterior chain or hamstring exercises but they do not have equipment to do deadlifts or that they do not have the proper setup to do Nordic curls/Harop curls/GHR in the RR. Bodyweight Hamstring Curls are a good alternative for such people. They are also easier to set up and it is also easier to understand the basic bio-mechanics of the exercise than Nordic curls/Harop curls/GHR which makes it a better option for beginners. Also, you do not need any fancy equipment or weights to do them. You only need rings or a suspension trainer. If you do not have rings/TRX, you can improvise. I have mentioned some no-equipment methods to do them later in this post.

Not only this, there are other benefits of Bodyweight Hamstring Curls that make them an amazing 'hinge' exercise. Most 'hinge' exercise work only one of the two functions of the hamstrings. The hamstrings can flex you knee and extend your hip. This exercise works both of these functions of the hamstrings at the same time whereas other popular 'hinge' exercises work either hip extension(deadlifts) or knee flexion(all those machine curls that you do in the gym).

Important thing to note is that these are not a replacement for weighted deadlifts. There is no better way to work your posterior chain than a deadlift. But that doesn't mean that you can't get an effective posterior chain workout from them. Bodyweight Hamstring Curls will absolutely fry your glutes and your hamstrings. You might feel a burn that you have never felt before so be prepared for that. Also, you can scale it infinitely so that you can keep on progressing, keep on building strength and keep on building muscle for a long time.

Sad thing is that not many people talk about them on the internet. Even the RR does not mention this exercise in the 'hinge' progression section. This is preventing people to reap the benefits of this amazing exercise.

# Correct way to perform Bodyweight Hamstring Curls and ways to progress/regress

Matt from Red Delta Project explains it much better than I can ever do. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzE9hHj82XA) to learn how to do this exercise correctly and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe3fNdMcoKw) to learn how to keep progressing with this exercise.

I like do this exercise in 8-15 rep range. Once I can do 15 reps of a particular progression, I move on to the next. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jt1G0p2-Ec) is a very useful tip to help you reduce lower back pressure if you feel any.

# What if I do not have rings or a suspension trainer?

The most effective way of doing Bodyweight Hamstring Curls is to to do them on the rings or TRX but you can improvise with common household objects if you are creative. Here are some examples:

* Here is Jeff Cavaliere, AthleanX dot com demonstrating this exercise with a [physioball](https://youtu.be/136r3U-Pewk?t=205).
* If you do not have a physioball, here is u/whiteSkar doing this exercise with a [skateboard](https://youtu.be/ODnkYcNDafU?t=144).
* If you do not have a skateboard, you can hang a bedsheet from a pullup bar.
* If you do not have a bedsheet and a pullup bar, you can do this exercise with furniture sliders. 
* If you do not have furniture sliders, you can wear socks and do this exercise on a smooth floor.
* You can even make your own [DIY suspension trainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9oCTAeT-iA) and [foot slings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4t5ZxaXgUk). This DIY suspension trainer will be very useful and you can do a variety of different exercises with it.

These options might not be as comfortable as the rings or TRX but still, something is better than nothing.

I highly encourage you guys to try this exercise out and see how it goes.

Thanks for reading!

[5 years] - Big guy transformation,Osemka8,1105,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7yw5sy/5_years_big_guy_transformation/,1519136055.0,"Hey guys. I rarely post pictures of myself or brag'n stuff, but I am proud of my journey, so I decided to post my transformation on this community, where I still, after all this time, find answers to my questions. **Thank you all for that.**


**Basic info:**

- 28 yo male

- 192 cm (6""3)

- 92 kg (202 lb)

**Note:** I was around 85 kg (187 lb) when I started but first slimmed down to 78 kg (171 lb) and 5-6% BF


**Transformation photo:** [CLICK](http://shrani.si/f/V/Fn/1hSnH9Tn/brez-naslova.jpg)


**Reasons why:** I've decided to change my life completely on 1.1.2013 and that doesn't include only physical appearance, but mentality as well. I wasn't satisfied with myself, my confidence and I felt this is not who I was. Being a perfectionist, that bothered me. A lot. So one day I just said I want what I don't have and I put words into actions. I am one of those NY resolutioners, but every single thing I told myself I'll do, I still am doing. Even if it's just making my bed when I get up.


**The start:** My primary sport is volleyball, but I had to cut my dreams short due to all the injuries I had. Knees, shoulders, ankles, you name it. So it was time for me to find love elsewhere. My bro started going to the kid's playground at night to do some pullups, dips and pushups and I joined in. Since then, I've never missed a workout on purpose. I started with street workout, doing basics for about 3 years until I wanted to push myself even further. It took me more than half a year to achieve my first muscle-up. 

**The journey:** I had to adapt. I saw that if I continue progressing as I do, I won't make it to my goals. So I started learning from my own mistakes. Last year I totally reprogrammed my workout and am focusing more on calisthenics/gymnastics approach with a pinch of yoga (which is my next goal). So yes, 8 months ago I started doing flexibility/mobility on a regular basis, which helped me with my injuries. I regret it not doing it earlier.


**Current weekly routine:**

- *Monday:* planche, front lever

- *Tuesday*: one arm pull work, handstands

- *Wednesday:* lower body, more focus on mobility/flexibility

- *Thursday:* lighter planche, front lever work

- *Friday:* free basics to keep it fun

- *Saturday/Sunday:* focus on mobility/flexibility

**Note:** every 4th week is deload and it works nicely for me. If I'll hit a plateau, I'll do lighter workouts and deload on 5th or 6th in the future


**Achievements:**

- 15s back lever

- 7s front lever

- 10s human flag

- one arm pullups (both arms)

- 70 kg (155 lb) weighted pullup

- 60 kg (132 lb) dip

**Note:** after 2 years of skill work and a good starting foundation


**Future goals:**

- straddle planche until the end of 2019 (advanced tuck atm and a solid straddle negative) and full planche

- hanstand press (improving calf and hamstring flexibility)

- 10s+ front lever

- pancake pose, splits


**Diet:** I don't bulk or cut and hold BF at around 8-10% through the whole year.  I never counted calories. My diet is clean, at home we are mostly self-sufficient when it comes to fruits and veggies, which helps a lot. Of course I spoil myself, especially now when I'm craving carbs cause I'm overtrained so I'm taking the entire week off. These deload weeks are the worst. I swear anything can make me cry atm :)


**Supplements:** only creatine. I stay away from all other stuff.


**Important lessons learnt:** quality over quantity, leave your ego at home, flexibility/mobility is extremely important.


**Lastly:** If anyone has any questions about my diet or workout, I'll gladly reply. I can present my strength gains and detailed workouts in another post if there's interest. I have to approach workouts differently as I am quite heavy and tall. But I still believe I will someday get to where I want to be. Everyone who put in an effort can. Having control over yourself can benefit all aspects of your life, not just looks and strength. Persistence always pays off.

3 Month Progress - 189.8 to 164.0,iHardstuck_Bronze,1105,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/os6d2e/3_month_progress_1898_to_1640/,1627328558.0,"Not really sure if progress photos are allowed or not but I wanted to share with anyone that may need some motivation! 

\-----

At one point, I was a very high level athlete and had never been above 15% body fat. Over the last few years I have been steadily gaining weight due to no longer competing and starting my own business. Time seemed to slip away but I kept gaining weight. 

Then COVID hit last march! I was forced to stay at home and put my business on hold. At this point, I started to develop severe depression. I was over eating and drinking alcohol almost every night. I went from weighing 160lbs to 189.8lbs at 5'6""!

My wife and friends eventually pushed me to go speak with someone and I finally went to the doctor in April to seek help. 

It was May 1st that I decided that I was going to transform my body as well as my mind. I stopped drinking alcohol, energy drinks, and eating fast food.

I started off by doing 1 min of planks every time I felt the need to eat any junk food. After about a week of just doing planks, I started walking 1 lap around my neighborhood. 

Eventually that turned into doing pushups, squats and pullups with my planks. Before I knew it, I was doing anywhere from 400-800 pushups/squats and 50 pullups per day! Yesterday I ran 2 miles for the first time in over 5 years without stopping!

&#x200B;

After 3 months of doing nothing but small at home workouts; I have lost 26lbs. Here is my progressive photo.

If you are struggling with depression please go speak with a doctor! It has helped me get my life back on track and living healthy again. Sorry for the long post!

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR: 

I was depressed and gained 30 lbs over the last year. My family pushed me to see the doctor for help. After seeing the doctor, I decided to get back in shape. I lost 26lbs from cutting out alcohol, junk food and doing pushups, squats, pullups and planks.

What I didn't know and only just discovered is the full program incorporating all the elements of a balanced fitness regime.

[http://agt.degreesofclarity.com ](http://agt.degreesofclarity.com)

It is six days of training program. Each day focuses on skill (fatiguing and non-fatiguing) and stretching but alternates between a combination of strength, sprints and conditioning. Each workout should take 90 minutes.

The strength components are for weight-lifting however can easily be swapped out for calisthenics.

"Basic stretching and strength exercise for bad back, posture, stiff shoulders, stiff legs.",ali1278,1106,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fdfp79/basic_stretching_and_strength_exercise_for_bad/,1583340164.0,"Hi guys, due to me being totally inactive and not going gym much and not enough exercise, I started noticing stiffness in my body, I do have a problematic shoulder and lower back from years of weight lifting. I used to be a hardcore weight lifter. I sort of stopped cause I kinda lost interest and Calisthenics and bodyweight stuff is great, keeps you fit and low weight, slim body, less stiffness/ strain and is a mixture of both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Weight lifting mixed with stretching is also great but I cant be bothered at the moment.

Anyways this workout is more geared towards stretching the legs, the spine, the diaphragm, the chest cavity for a better posture. Each exercise has its benefits, squats and leg stretching good for stiff legs and even sciatica problems, hanging for bad back, shoulders. Pullovers for diaphragm, upper body, spine stretching, general posture, lung function (more oxygen intake, also good for asthmatics and other respiratory diseases). Hanging leg raises for stronger abs and core and also stretches the tendons and ligaments in the groin area (good for sciatica and other related problems).

You can add some more exercises or take away some. I have not included any ''push'' workout for the upper body (as Im not concerned about that as of yet), but you can add bench press or push ups if you will. Any suggestions for improvements or better techniques are welcomed. Kind Regards and may you all be blessed with good health :)))))

&#x200B;

Frequency:

\-3 to 5 times a week.

&#x200B;

Required:

\-Pullup bar or anything stable for pull ups and hanging, legs dont need to be straightened out when hanging (better if it is though for a full stretch, but it doesnt make too much difference).

\-Barbell and some weights (for light/moderate resistance squats) could use a log or a pole or something similar.

\-Dumbell for pullovers and a bench (light/moderate resistance) could use a homemade weight with a decent bench alternative.

&#x200B;

WARMUP

\-Leg stretching and bar hanging superset (do a set of toe touching then quad stretches then inner thigh stretches SUPERSET with hanging from a bar - REPEAT this process for another 3 sets to give a total of 4 sets - change position of hands on each set on the bar).

Toe touching:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvr5N\_Xf6QM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvr5N_Xf6QM)

EDIT: People who find the ''toe touching'' exercise uncomfortable or want an alternative than there are two I found that can be done standing up, there might be more out there and these two might be better for your back than toe touching...

FYI, I started calisthenics around 7-9 months ago from scratch, so I couldn't even do 1 pushup, and 0 negative as well. What do you guys think about this? Was my process fast? And primarily, I would really appreciate some tips on what to do next.

My main goal is to learn Planche and maltese, but when I do tuck planche, my outer forearm/wrist pains at the beginning and the end of the hold, not in the middle. Anyone knows why, and the solution to it?

My another goal is to get muscle / bulk up. So, I would like to know some exercises which will help me in this.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I actually never focused on one arm pushup but on strengthening my primary muscles, i.e. Biceps, triceps, back, legs, etc.

Edit 2: I am taking my time reading every one of your interesting comments. Thanks for the tips and suggestions!

Edit 3: I have looked through every comment, as of now, and I thank you all for supporting and giving suggestions/tips(/feedback)!! Really appreciate it! Just saying: I am thinking about using resistance band from now on for my calves and biceps, in order to strengthen and make them big. I will still do chin-ups though!

An underappreciated aspect of bodyweightfitness,SarudeDandstrom,1090,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mtia2m/an_underappreciated_aspect_of_bodyweightfitness/,1618770076.0,"Is the social interaction.

Perhaps it's because I'm deprived of meeting new people (lockdown number whatever), but every workout I basically only have positive interactions with people of every walk of life.

Every workout I get to know more regulars in my local fitness-park. We exchange equipment, give each other advice and just shoot the shit.

One moment the egyptian dude I've only ever seen for the second time tells me to stay away from italian girls, cause they're too good and you can't forget their amore. The next moment a grandpa asks us wheter his shy grandkid can swing on the rings and tells us about when he was young, wrestling and could do 120 pushups in a row.

Then a guy jokes that marriage isn't for him and he's glad he didn't get married a couple of years ago, to which the next guy responds he's getting married in two weeks, which causes all to laugh and then wish him good luck.

After spending so much time indoors and being bombarded with the worst the world has to offer, going out and having positive, supportive interactions with yoga girls, djs, construction workers, students, ... cleanses my mind and mood. 

Every session I come home wanting to tell my roomate about the awesome time I had, when nothing noteworthy 'enough' for a story happened, but all the little things add up to an atmosphere of enjoyment I'd never have associated with sports just two years ago."
How to find time to exercise when you have to work a 9 hour shift?,devine_111,1079,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jqazq8/how_to_find_time_to_exercise_when_you_have_to/,1604838756.0,"Hello.

I've been doing calisthenics for over 6 years now. I started when i was a teen and I just finished university.

Please note that up untill now, i never really had a full time job. I used to do freelance work from home and that is the only work experience i have.

Recently, I got employed full time, yay!

The only problem is, i can't find even a second for myself with my new schedule.

I work a 9 hour shift with 1 hour break. The total amount of time it takes me to reach to work, work, and get back home is around 10, 10:15 hours.

I'm just so overwhelmed by the lack of time.

The only thing i wanna do after getting home is laze around or just sleep and i don't even get to do that as I have some side gigs which I work on when I get home.

So my question to all the working people out there who workout:

How do you manage time?

I can squeeze out 30 minutes or so for a workout session but they are very little considering I do advanced calisthenics and have to rest 5 or so minutes between sets.

I used to workout 6 days a week. Now I only workout on 2 days, Saturday and Sunday.

Even on those days, I'm starting to lose motivation and just do a few sets here and there.

Please guide me and reawaken the passion inside me I'm starting to lose sight of lol."

I did 30000+ pull-ups in a year,activeperson,1070,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hq9qhh/i_did_30000_pullups_in_a_year/,1594619020.0,"This chronicles by descent into the stupidity of 30566 pull-ups in a year. I want to first start by saying this: DO NOT DO THIS. This act of masochism was only done because I have a femoral impingement in my hip and couldn’t really exercise so I needed a way to continue to push myself without injuring my lower body any more. I decided I would try to do 20k pull-ups in the year inspired by Kane Sumbat’s New Years day pullup challenge where he does the year in pull-ups in a single day.  I’m probably gonna get some hate for this and how stupid it is and I know it is trust me but just wanted to share something I did. I haven’t seen really any kind of workouts or information on high volume pullups so here you go.

I started the challenge doing 250 pull-ups for a birthday and was INCREDIBLY sore.  My grip strength was nowhere where it needed to be so my forearms and lats were sore for at least 4-5 days afterwards. After that I just kept with my schedule and if I was doing 150 or less pull-ups in a workout than I would do 10 reps per set.  Any high volume day of more than 150 than I would do 5-6 pull-ups every minute on the minute till I hit my goal. My highest peak was 600 in 100 minutes.  I really wanted to hit 1000 and I think I could’ve but I had exposed blisters on both hands that was making it just too painful.  For the first 8 months I was averaging around 100 per day and my lats were almost always sore. I didn’t allow my body nearly enough time to recover.  

Around the time our quarantine ended, my hips were feeling a lot better so I was able to incorporate weights back into my lower body workouts.  I gained around 10 lbs over the next 4 months and ended my year at 175 lbs. I felt bigger and stronger overall but this made the pull-ups much more of an effort so I decided I wouldn’t go for 100/day but 30k pull-ups was a solid goal as I originally only planned for 20k. 

Workouts:

\-Weighted pull-ups and chinups twice a week

\-High volume pull-ups >150 on Saturdays

\-Rest days or 50-100 on the other days

A key to doing high volume pull-ups is to never get pumped. My sweet spot was 6 pull-ups every minute on the minute and I could really just get into a zone.  It was similar to a runner’s high or swimming for a long time, you don’t really feel your arms or back anymore.

Injury Prevention:

I used to rock climb a lot in the past so I’d already had a history with elbow issues. They’ve actually never gone away but I found ways to manage and improve them.  Where you actually grip the bar is very important, you want the bar in the palm of your hand so your fingers aren’t doing the work.  Just watch an AthleanX video on pull-ups so you can really nail down your form. A pullup is more technical than I thought and it’s important to get it all right when doing a ton. 

Jamming a lacrosse ball was key to loosen up tender and tough spots on my elbow and forearms. I did that consistently 3-4 times a week. I also iced my elbows and forearms with an ice cube 2-3 times a week typically after a heavy pullup or deadlift session.  The last thing I did was eccentric and concentric wrist curls for 9 minutes every other day, and this really helped heal and strengthen my golfers/tennis elbow.  I also did some shoulder therapy with light weights too. 

I have always had an aptitude towards pull-ups and could do 20 full range of motion before I started. I planned out the whole year in a spreadsheet and did lots of birthday pull-ups (age X 10) for my friends and family but mainly stuck doing weighted pull-ups twice a week and taking 1-2 rest days a week.  

My rules:

1)  Full ROM only, no 75% and up. Full to nearly full extension of elbows then chin above bar. I really tried to keep this true for every pullup I did. 

2)  No kipping, nothing against it but it’s not a pullup, it’s a different exercise 

3)  If going for >150 pullups go neutral grip to save my elbows

4)  I counted chin ups, pullups, neutral grip pullups, weighted pullups and just totaled them all. 

Things i would do differently:

Focus on mind muscle connection more

Focus on building strength instead of just pure # of reps 

Get a pullup bar sooner, I didn’t have a pullup bar in my apartment until month 9 so everything was done in parks or the gym. 

Stats:

Maybe only interesting to me but I love looking at #’s. 

Pullups: 11518 37.68% of total pullups

Chinups: 3898 12.75%

Neutral Grip: 8738 28.59%

Weighted: 2176 7.12%

Averaged 83.51 a day for 366 days. 

587.81 a week

2547.16 a month

Highest # I had consecutively was 27, but I think this would’ve been higher if I hadn’t gained weight. I just did a weighted pullup workout 75 lbs for 5 sets of 5, I haven’t tested my max in a while but last time I tried I got 3 plates so 135 lbs for 1. 

My highest total in a month was 3671 from mid-December to mid-January. 

Final thoughts

I really enjoyed the process and the challenge.  I adapted to injuries and healing of old ones.  I’m proud of myself for doing that many pull-ups and how my training philosophy evolved over the course of the year.  There’s a lot of value into devising a good program and sticking to it, too many people get caught up in devising the perfect strategy for gains but honestly that stuff is really only 10% of gains and you’ll never do everything optimally. Consistency is key and having a plan of how many pull-ups to do and try to achieve was fun and good for me. I hope to never do that many pull-ups in a year again.  One thing I really liked was that it became second nature to be on the bar. I definitely got a strong and bigger back but the real hypertrophy gains ended pretty quickly and I only noticed more gains when I started hitting heavier weighted pull-ups and deadlifts.  Basically, if you do this many pull-up you really just get good at pull-ups.

&#x200B;

**Background**

A little over a year ago I touched into the triple digits (kg) again, and decided I was done with being overweight. I have a lot of joint issues that were getting more annoying. Scoliosis in my back (you can my rib cage being a bit diagonal in some of the photos if you know where to look), Osgood-Schlatter in both my knees, and flat feet with shortened Achilles tendon and tendon plate. I've got medically prescribed arch supports orthotics, but it only helps so much. >45 min of standing or walking would absolutely kill my feet and my back was hurting even with simple things. I was terribly out of shape and it was time for a change.

\[Edit: Since some people have asked, I'm 24 and 6'0""\]

&#x200B;

**Diet**

As my main goal was weight loss, diet was the most important thing for me. I started counting calories and lost some weight, but I grew sick of it really quickly as I was just constantly hungry. Eventually I found a book (translated: ""The Food Hourglass"") that described in great detail everything about what a 'healthy diet' was, i.e. extending your healthy lifespan. It wasn't even necessarily about weight loss. It was written by a scientist and had \~200 scientific references and I finally had the idea it was something I could trust. For the most part the advice came down to avoiding sugars & fast carbs like bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, etc. and instead eating slower carbs like oatmeal, buckwheat, sweet potato, or whole grain variants, or carbs that were supplemented with lots of fibers like fruits and vegetables. Besides that I mostly avoided dairy (exception for cheese) and chose instead for plant-based alternatives like soy and almond milk. There's a lot of other things like replacing red meats with chicken & fish, yada yada, but that's the gist of it. Most of this stuff is common knowledge by now, but it helped a lot to have it all in one place and read the scientific explanations.  I followed the advice as best I could. I didn't need to watch my intake anymore and just ate until I was no longer hungry. I was very consistent with my breakfast and lunch, and applied it to dinner as often as I could, but never sacrificed a night of eating out or drinking if it came up. The first weeks really took some getting used to, 2 times when I started I even had to down some pure sugar as I was getting faint, but once I broke through it was the easiest thing. I started feeling more full and didn't have any cravings. Weight loss was slow but comfortable. Now that I'm approaching the last bit and exercising a lot more I eat a little bit more protein with things like cottage cheese and the occasional protein shake if I'm eating vegetarian that day. I also went a little more hardcore in tracking calories and ensuring I stay at a deficit and 1.5-2.0 g/kg protein intake. Initially I didn't plan to do this, but I noticed I was plateauing. I consider it a temporary fix until I'm properly in shape.

&#x200B;

**Workout**

BWF was always perfect for me. I don't like going to the gym and my back-, knee-, and feet problems would really benefit from a 'lean' build to carry as little weight as possible. As far as I can tell concerning genetics (this is just a guess based on experience), building muscle is pretty easy for me, but losing fat is incredibly difficult.  I figured BWF training would be enough for me to maintain some muscle while dieting. I've dipped into it a few times during my weight loss, but never for more than 2 or 3 weeks or so before I gave up. Researching my diet and mealprepping etc. already required a lot of effort and attention, and I just couldn't find the time to work out consistently. On top of that I just didn't enjoy some of the RR exercises.

The last 2 months I've sort of whipped up my own routine that I would be able to stick with and I've been giving it more priority now that the dieting has become a routine and doesn't require as much effort anymore. I've noticed a huge difference in muscle tone in the last 2 months. Honestly I think it doesn't really show as well in the photos as what I can see in the mirror. I've really got a taste for it now and I think on average I exercise about 5 times a week (a combination of BWF, squash, and bouldering (free climbing)).

This is my customised workout and progress in the last 2 months. I don't consider myself an expert so I'm really not sure if what I cooked up covers all bases, but it's at least been something I enjoy and can stick to, and feels like I'm making progress.

*Warmup:*

* Yuri Shoulder band stretches (10 each)
* Arch Hangs (10)
* Front Leg swings (15 each)
* Side Leg swings (15 each)
* Deadbug (30 sec)
* Wrist prep (any)

*Set 1*

* Pullups: from 5-3-3 to 8-8-6
* Pike Pushups: 8-6-6 (increasing angle every time)

*Set 2*

* Abs: 7-minute follow-along: alternating between [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHD1-2P94DI) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jyhJ6TiUPA) video. Still not quite able to perform the entire thing, but getting close
* Legs: 10-minute follow-along: [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erKJOb51bCI) video, now able to follow the entire thing fairly easily

*Set 3*

* from Pushups 8-8-6 to Pseudo Planche 8-8-6 (increasing forward lean)
* from Rows 8-7-6 to Horizontal Rows 12-12-12

*Offdays*

On offdays I typically go for a game of squash of 45 minutes, and once a week I go bouldering (free climbing). I also try to do some quad & pec stretches everyday in an attempt to fix my posture (I think I still have something to work on there).

&#x200B;

**Future**

Probably not the hugest change, but personally I'm very happy with my results. It's made a big difference for my aching joints and overall endurance. I don't see myself stopping BWF any time soon. Although I might try some gym & weights once I move from cutting to bulking after I lose enough fat (particularly around the lovehandles). I'll probably also keep sticking to my diet because of all the other health benefits discussed by the book, but I'll probably just eat more of it when I need to bulk.

&#x200B;

I still consider myself a beginner to the scene, but I hope maybe the (somewhat successful) progress of a beginner could offer some perspective to other beginners here looking to start."

I’ve been using it for the past couple weeks, and it was perfect. Very simple design- two long poles with perpendicular bases, and the pull-up bar connecting them. 

Today, I was using my rings to do face pulls at the end of my workout, and one of the vertical poles snapped at the joint. I fell and knocked my wind out and narrowly avoided the rest of the structure as it fell towards me. 

I’ll be designing something a lot stronger this weekend.

INSANE Pushup Gains!!!,SoneiOTree,1066,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i4a29f/insane_pushup_gains/,1596649779.0,"For background, I'm a 165 pound 17 year old male who is in decent shape, I've been lifting weights since I was 13. 

Due to covid, I haven't been going to the gym besides them all being reopened as I really do not want to catch that bug. In replacement, I've been doing insane amounts of pushups, pullups, and ab exercises at my home. 

For 2 months, I have been doing 400 pushups a night, 8 sets of 50 reps with about 5 minutes rest between each set. Before this, I would rep out 135lbs on benchpress for 8 reps. 

Well today while on vacation, I decided to go to my resorts gym and THE GAINS ARE ASTONISHING!!! I did not try to test my max weight but I felt comfy with adding 50 POUNDS TO MY BENCH!!! I ended up doing 185 for 5 reps and 155 for 12 reps, each for 3 sets. I've never been so hyped about my weightlifting gains but this is just absolutely amazing. I never thought I would be at this point, especially given my 2020 goal was to reach 200lbs on the bench. Safe to say, I think I might be on track to blowing that goal out of the water.

Edit: This was done on a Smith machine so definitely may make up for some of the weight increase as well, Smith machine bars aren't the typical 45 pounds a barbell would be. I'll look into it tomorrow how much said Smith machine bar weighs lol"

How to periodize your bodyweight strength training (and why you should do it),StrongbyBodyweight,1069,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nns5an/how_to_periodize_your_bodyweight_strength/,1622309192.0,"After reading this you will (hopefully) have enough info to build your own periodized bodyweight strength training program.

## WHAT IS PERIODIZATION?

Periodization is how you structure your training program over the long term. Some important things to know:

* **Microcycle:** A week of training
* **Mesocycle:** A training phase, usually containing 4-6 microcycles or weeks. More or less is OK.
* **Macrocycle:** All of your mesocycles put together over a long period, usually a year
* **Accumulation:** The goal of increasing volume over the length of a mesocycle
* **Intensification:** The goal of increasing intensity over the length of a mesocycle
* **Realization:** The goal of peaking max strength, power, and/or increasing skill over the length of a mesocycle
* **Deload:** A microcycle at the end of each mesocycle where volume and/or intensity is decreased so the body can recover and manage accumulated fatigue.
* **MEV:** Minimum Effective Volume. The smallest amount of volume you need to make gains.
* **MRV:** Maximum Recoverable Volume. The point at which volume is so high that you can’t recover from it.
* **Potentiation:** The concept that the order of training phases matters. Hypertrophy gains last longer and support strength building. Strength gains last a moderate amount of time and support skill work. So the order of Accumulation, Intensification, and Realization matters.

## WHY IS PERIODIZATION IMPORTANT?

Many bodyweight strength training programs out there are pretty simple. You’ll see things like, do 3 sets of 5-8 reps, and when you can do 8 reps, go to the next progression. This is good for beginners as they can make quick progress and have an easy program to follow. However, this program will not last forever. Just like adding 5lbs to the bar every workout won’t last forever, sticking in a single rep range and cranking up progressions won’t work forever with bodyweight exercise.

Periodization is important because it allows us to focus on different goals so that they work together to achieve the best results. For example, if you want to do a front lever, you need to get stronger. To get stronger, you need to build bigger muscles. It’s hard to program all of that (hypertrophy, strength, and skill) in one training program.

Periodization works because it’s easier to maintain your gains than to gain them in the first place, and each phase supports the next. This is called potentiation. Hypertrophy gains last the longest, and they unlock a greater potenital for strength. So hypertrophy goes first. As you then work on strength, your muscle mass is maintained due to the intense training, but you are also getting stronger. This then supports your max strength, power, and skill training.

## HOW TO PERIODIZE FOR BODYWEIGHT STRENGTH TRAINING

## MESOCYCLE 1: ACCUMULATION

The goal of the Accumulation Phase is hypertrophy (building as much muscle as possible). This muscle will then be used to get stronger in the next phase.

We can increase volume in 3 ways:

1. Increase the number of working sets (a set between 5 and 30 reps, taken to within 0-4 reps of failure.
2. Increase the number of reps (can be used for a smaller increase in volume)
3. Increase the intensity (in bodyweight training, this is increasing the progression or scaling)

We want to rely on #1, then #2 when that becomes difficult. #3 is not as important during the mesocycle, but should be increased over subsequent mesocycles.

An accumulation phase should start at your MEV (Minimum Effective Volume), and gradually increase volume over the next few weeks, until you hit your MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume). 4-6 weeks is the usual length of this phase, but it can be longer. It depends on you knowing your body and your training logs.

**You’ll know when you reach your MRV when you can no longer match the previous weeks volume.** This means you didn’t recover fully, and it’s time for a deload, where you cut the volume in half. If you were to run this cycle again, you’d start at your MEV, and build to your MRV, which should now be a little bit higher, either due to being able to do more reps and sets, OR being able to use a higher intensity.

Training in this way is effective for hypertrophy. Depending on your goals, you could repeat this training phase, or move on to the Intensification Phase.

Example Set Scheme:  
Day 1: 3x5-10r  
Day 2: 3x10-20r  
Day 3: 3x20-30r  
Week 2, add a set to each exercise. Repeat until deload.

Edit: for clarification, see this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nns5an/how\_to\_periodize\_your\_bodyweight\_strength/gzw98o2/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nns5an/how_to_periodize_your_bodyweight_strength/gzw98o2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

## MESOCYCLE 2: INTENSIFICATION

The goal of the Intensification Phase is building strength. We are taking the new muscle we have built in the Accumulation Phase and using it to get even stronger.

The main way we will train for strength is gradually increasing the intensity (progression and/or scaling of an exercise). The volume for this phase will stay relatively constant, and will be less than the Accumulation Phase. We’ll use a lower rep range, and focus on harder exercises.

We still use MEV and MRV here to determine when we go into a deload. This time, our volume is determined more by our intensity than sets and reps. **So, when you can no longer maintain the same volume or intensity as the previous week, it’s time for a deload week, where you cut the volume in half.**

Training in this way is effective for building strength, but we need a base of muscle in order to make good gains. That is why Accumulation, or hypertrophy training, comes first.

Example Set Scheme:  
3-5x4-6r, try to add, in order of importance: more intensity/harder progression, reps, sets. Continue until deload.

## MESOCYCLE 3: REALIZATION

The goal of the Realization Phase is to either achieve new maxes in strength, apply your strength to skills, or increase power.

Generally, we’ll want to do even more intense exercises than in the Intensification Phase, but for much less volume. In addition, as we ramp up the intensity, we will decrease the volume even further. This will help achieve new maxes in strength. You can pair this with higher volume, but lower intensity skill and power work.

This phase is usually the shortest, about 4 weeks. Once you achieve your new 1 rep max, personal best, or can’t maintain volume or intensity, it’s time for a deload.

Example Set Scheme:  
Week 1: 5x5  
Week 2: 5x4  
Week 3: 5x3  
Week 4: 5x2  
Week 5: 5x1  
Week 6: Deload

## PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

You can put together your periodized training plan depending on your goals.

* **You want to get bigger:** You can do 1 or more cycles of Accumulation, each cycle being probably 4-6 weeks. After a few cycles, you do want to do at least one cycle of intensification before going back to accumulation.
* **You want to get stronger:** You can cycle through Accumulation and Intensification at a 1:1 ratio. After all, you do need to build muscle to get stronger.
* **You want to get bigger, stronger, and achieve skills like front lever, handstand pushup, etc:** cycle through all 3 phases in a 1:1:1 ratio. You can spend more time in a certain phase if you have a weakness. For example if you need bigger lats so you’re strong enough for front lever, you can spend longer in the accumulation phase.

As you can see, periodization is as much of an art as it is science. It’s best for a plan to be tailored to you, your goals, and your strengths and weaknesses to be most effective. It’s also best for you to understand how it works and to log your training so that you can adjust it as needed.

Do you periodize your training? If so, how?

Nick-E (otherwise known to some as the 'guy from the deadbug tutorial in the wiki') here!

First off, happy new year! And to any new people coming to the subreddit looking to get started; Welcome!

It's been a while since I've made any content, as I've been busy with uni and work. However I've recently been hard at work redesigning my site to have a little more structure in terms of the way that I can deliver educational content to y'all. That has taken the form of an exercise library!

This project is currently in development, it's by no means finished or even close. It takes a while for me to get each exercise entry right with the level of quality and detail that I'm happy to share as a (mostly) comprehensive guide for it. Thus far, I have finished 4 exercises in the bodyweight exercises section: 

the [Pull-up](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/the-pull-up/),

the [Push-up](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/pushup/), 

the [Squat](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/squats/) 

and the [Inverted Row](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/row/). 

I plan to fill out the sections for Barbell and Kettlebell, etc. as well but I'd like to get the Bodyweight section to an acceptable degree of completion first because I've always made my content primarily for this community and I don't really post it much anywhere else. Anyway, here it is!

# Exercise Library Link:

&#x200B;

# [http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/)

&#x200B;

# How the Exercises are Taught

Most of the entries have (And most future entries will have) a specific structure to them:

*  The movement is broken down into the start position, the end position and the movement itself, with details given at each stage.
* I outline a few (maybe 3 to 5) of the most common errors I see in individuals performing these movements from all the form checks on this subreddit (and it's corresponding discord channel), personal coaching clients, and individuals I see in the gym on a day to day basis.
* Within that I give suggestions as to potentially why this error is occurring, and then some brief notes on how to correct this error.
* Following that I give easier variation example(s) for those that cannot perform the default movement properly, and also harder variations for those that need to progress from the standard level of difficulty.

Some entries/exercises will deviate from this structure if I believe it would be more effectively taught in a different way.

# Development over Time

In the near future (e.g. this month) I would like to work on getting at least the following entries into the library so as to have the most utility when used in conjunction with the RR:

* Dips (Ring and PB)
* Pike Push-ups
* Hinge and Progressions

I have old articles on all three of these things on my site already, but I'd like to update them, give them more detail in the form of the structure I wrote above, and generally improve the way they are taught on the site.

With those complete I think it will cover a majority of what is needed in the RR. After that the less high priority items (e.g. a palof press for example) will trickle in over time.

I would also like to devote the necessary time to documenting my method for teaching the handstand but that will take a lot of time and effort, so it will probably take the back seat until the other main movements in the RR are complete unless it is in super high demand.

Those are my ideas, if anyone would like to chime in and maybe vote for what they'd like to see most next that would give me a good idea of what's more 'in-demand' so I can get that done before others.

# Other News

Alongside the making of the exercise library I've also redesigned my website. It's not as front and centre but ***all my old posts/content is still there, and still freely available!*** Just click the 'Tutorials' tab in the top corner and you'll see all of my old stuff.

My biggest gains was in happiness. Thank you r/bodyweightfitness,Silvertheprophecy,1059,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/zkr3t9/my_biggest_gains_was_in_happiness_thank_you/,1670921798.0,"At the beginning of this year I (21F) made a cliché new year resolution to start getting healthier. I wanted to make a difference for my mental health. I was like, ok, I'll do a program three times a week, every week.

This year was my final 6 months of uni so I had to wrestle a graduation project which demanded long hours alongside a casual job, and with no rest time in between I immediately was working a 9-5 for the remaining 6 months and also running a volunteering organisation outside of work. Some days I would be too exhausted and dread exercise. Some other biological reasons I have also knock me down a bit. But I would always at least stretch or maybe just attempt something, anything at all. 

So I did what could 3 times a week. For 12 months. Here's some of my progress (this is not my complete program):

1. 5x5 waist-height incline pushups to 3x7 normal pushups
2. 0 pull-ups to 3 pull-up negatives
3. 3x10 squats to 3x5 assisted pistol squats

You'll notice for 1 year, it's not much. And I'm not surprised. I couldn't prioritise exercise every time and efficiently progress. I only made small dietary changes when I can (reduce processed foods and eat more protein). If someone was to look at a photo of me before and after, they also wouldn't see much transformation.

Yet, despite all this, I'm happy. I'm happy I found this sub and all its supportive people. I probably won't be an amazing gymnast doing levers and planches any time soon, and I'm still on a long road to my first pullup. But I'm glad I'm here. 

Thank you, r/bodyweightfitness!"

I started my fitness journey a good many years ago when, as a young 19 year-old who had spent way too much time watching Dragonball Z, I decided it was time to take up gym and add some muscle to my 53kg, 173cm frame. I remember at that stage thinking that building muscle was as simple as “powering up” and reaching Super Saijan level through sheer force of will alone. I began lifting weights with very little guidance, but even so, I made gainz! Not superhero level gains, but gains nonetheless. My diet was wack, but as is the case with most beginners, I still packed on some size, ending around 67kg or so.

Fast-forward a few years later and I discovered the world of bodybuilding. I remember being inspired by proper bodybuilders like THE one and only Arnold, Mike O’Hearn and CT Fletcher. From that point onwards I fell in love with lifting weights. Maxing out my 1RM and striving to do all these amazing lifts with mindblowing weights was a pure shot of adrenaline to my motivation levels. At one point I really got into this and started putting on some good size, hitting about 77kg at my maximum, and my lifts were 120kg Bench Press, 140kg Squat, 160kg Deadlift.

Come January 2017 and I felt super lacklustre about returning to gym. I had taken off gym for the last few weeks of December and was dreading the January rush of all the new-years resolutionists. It was around this time that I discovered the undeniably wonderful world of calisthenics. From this point onwards, I knew I was done with bodybuilding. There is nothing so wonderfully challenging and exciting in fitness as calisthenics. I cannot even begin to explain how much I love it – being able to train outdoors, being able to do things that I had always wanted to (I’m a massive fan of Ninja Warrior (Sasuke – the Japanese one) and played enough Prince of Persia / Assassins Creed to want to be an agility master); and just the overall drive to do things that most people cannot.

However, when I started training, I did not have a proper understanding of how to do this, and just haphazardly followed THENX routines and others from YouTube, but not seeing major progression. It was only when I discovered Overcoming Gravity that I really reset, because I finally understood that progress can be measured, even in bodyweight training, and there is a very structured way of doing exactly this.

Over the last few months, I have restarted my calisthenics journey and effectively undertaken a “Quest” to become a bodyweight training ~~monster~~ MASTER. This journey entails mastering all of the skills from the well-known Overcoming Gravity charts. However, from all of my prior experience with skill training of this sort, I have always come up short in terms of strength. Knowing a fair bit on this from my prior bodybuilding training, I know what I needed – a foundation of pure strength, which leads me to this post and to the training which I have been doing the last few months.

&#x200B;

So with all of that being said, let’s move onto the part of this post that adds value to YOU!

**6 – FAQs + some real results!**

&#x200B;

**First, a note:**

To eliminate any potential confusion with using the phrase “strength training”, when I refer to strength training in this post, I am referring specifically to high intensity training done with the intention to **increase one-rep maximum lifts** (1RM, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition\_maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum)). In layman’s terms, this is training done with the simple goal of being able to lift more, and in our context, this can of course mean lifting more bodyweight as well!

&#x200B;

**1.** **THE BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING:**

The benefits associated with strength training are (and this is by no means exhaustive):

**1) an increase in lean body mass** ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean\_body\_mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_body_mass));

Study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20543750](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20543750)

&#x200B;

**2) increase in metabolic rate** ([https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic\_rate](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_rate));

&#x200B;

**4) decrease risk of injury**;

Just a note: Being strong alone isn’t sufficient to reduce the risk of injury. “Knowing how to activate this strength through optimal patterns of movement is what really underlies any effective injury prevention strategy.” - [https://truesportsphysicaltherapy.com/strength-prevent-injury](https://truesportsphysicaltherapy.com/strength-prevent-injury)

&#x200B;

**5) building back lost muscle tissue that commonly occurs with aging (sarcopenia);**

&#x200B;

**6) increases in testosterone over extended periods;**

&#x200B;

**7) delaying the onset of Alzheimers and dementia;**

**9) improved neuro-muscular connection;**

Here, I’d just like to quote a couple of really relevant and interesting points from the article:

*Research in the field of neuroscience has continuously validated the crucial role of neural drive and repetition in strength training. The literature repeatedly points to three fundamental conclusions that all athletes need to be aware of:*

*i.* *Athletes naturally train their brains during a workout. However, athletes who fail to focus specifically on neurological training while working out are limiting their athletic potential.*

*ii.* *By focusing on neurological training during a workout, athletes can unlock their true athletic potential at an accelerated rate.*

*iii.* *When combined with strength training, neurological training comes with the additional benefit of “cross-education” — i.e. training the brain to more effectively strengthen one muscle group indirectly strengthens contralateral muscle groups.*

&#x200B;

**10) skill training becomes easier! (see below)**

&#x200B;

**2.** **STRENGTH TRAINING VS SKILL TRAINING**

**Why should you start training with strength training instead of skill training?**

Let’s be real - in general, when people first find calisthenics, they just jump straight into skills training. And who can blame them; the skills look super awesome, are sure to impress others, and fit the whole Super Saiyan 3 image a lot better than being a master at perfect form pullups, dips and the like. Even within this subreddit you can see this phenomena – so many newbies will make a post asking how to achieve their full planche, front lever or one-arm chinup, but if you ask them a few questions deep, you’ll find that they can barely do a set of pullups. A lot of these guys won’t have a significant period of foundational strength training and conditioning behind them – in most cases, even less than a year. Now don’t get me wrong, I am certainly not going to preach against this, as there does appear to be a group of gifted athletes out there who are able to achieve skills with minimal effort and make the rest of us look like our daily grind is an exercise (pun unintended) in futility – “Why don’t you just actually DO the skill?” they ask… Ha, if only we could be so lucky!

This talented group aside, for the rest of us, we have to put in considerable time and effort in order to achieve these high-level skills. It often isn’t a very linear process either, and we have to go back and forth trying to figure out what the best way is to appropriately climb our own personal skill ladder, oftentimes giving up along the way from pure frustration.

Now here is the good news – there is a way to make this entire process far simpler, but it requires an investment on your part. As you will soon discover, having exceptionally high levels of strength is something that can leapfrog you forward on many skill progressions.

Unfortunately, strength doesn’t come easily, it requires you to absolutely blast your muscles into oblivion. For the most part, it isn’t something that happens overnight either – you don’t just “become” strong by trying it out. It requires hours upon hours of pushing your body to its limits and giving your body sufficient nutrients to recover and overcompensate for the damage you have done to it.

&#x200B;

**3.** **THE MECHANICS OF STRENGTH TRAINING**

Let’s get into the specifics of strength training.

&#x200B;

**3.1. SETS AND REPS**

**What does strength training look like?**

Strength training requires you to push yourself to the limits of your muscle ability. This normally entails performing sets of often very basic exercises, but sufficiently overloading the movement so that you can only **perform between 3-5 reps**. Overloading the exercise usually means adding weight, but it doesn’t have to be limited to this, as there are other options. For example, you can also decrease the leverage of your body so that the movement becomes tougher to the extent that you can only knock out a few reps.

Study: [https://www.allthingsgym.com/sets-reps-table-for-strength-hypertrophy-power/](https://www.allthingsgym.com/sets-reps-table-for-strength-hypertrophy-power/)

Study (*pretty much one of the best articles I have ever seen on strength training – a great resource for your reference when doing any strength work):* [https://sci-fit.net/scientific-recommendations-1/](https://sci-fit.net/scientific-recommendations-1/)

&#x200B;

You should also aim to **knock out at least 3-5 sets** **per exercise**, preferably ensuring that your **total volume for either pulling or pushing movements is around 25-50 reps**, more or less. If you opt to train muscle groups, like chest, arms, etc separately, then you can also aim for similar total volume ranges per muscle group.

It is preferable to **stick to basic exercises** for the simple reason that there is far less risk of injury when adding weight or otherwise overloading the movement. You may think it is better to climb up a few progressions on the particular exercise you are doing, but this is going to add an element of difficulty to the movement that makes it far tougher to just concentrate on banging out the reps and building brute strength. Your mind has to focus on other things, like balance for example. In addition, your joints are not always strong enough to take the jump in difficulty for the harder progression.

Sticking to basic exercises also means that you will be forced to build up **that neuromuscular connection** when you perform the exercises with dead on perfect form for many reps. As mentioned in the benefits above, you also reduce the risk of injury by performing the same movements and building neural pathways in the brain.

Some basic exercises, for reference, are:

\- **Pullups + chinups** for vertical pulling

\- **Rows** for horizontal pulling

\- **Pushups** for horizontal pushing

\- **Dips** for vertical pushing

&#x200B;

**3.2. FREQUENCY**

**How often should you train strength?**

The scientific literature on this topic appears to be undecided. In individual studies, there tends to be no statistically significant difference between low and high frequency training. For reference, see this study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081873/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081873/)

However, here is an amazingly in-depth meta-analysis showing that strength gains (measured via 1RM) are indeed higher on higher frequency strength programs:

[https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-frequency/](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-frequency/)

The conclusions here are:

\- **Higher frequency strength training leads to greater strength gains versus lower frequency strength training**.

\- Interestingly, this **only** seems to be **statistically significant for upper body strength gains**, as lower body gains appear unaffected by frequency of workouts.

&#x200B;

It stands to reason that we should try to do strength training as often as possible. This, of course, does not mean that we should train every day, because our recovery would suffer immensely (see section below on recovery). (\*A notable quote from the study: *If your shoulder starts bothering you when you bench three or more times per week, don’t force yourself to grind through the pain because science says higher pressing frequencies are optimal.*)

&#x200B;

It is also worth mentioning that there is great value in **combining strength and hypertrophy** training together. I did this in my last training cycle and saw nice results, both in muscle growth and in strength.

&#x200B;

The way you do this is by having days focused on strength and also days focused on hypertrophy. This is done via changing up the rep ranges. We can go with a 3-5 rep range for strength with a basic movement like a pullup, and then go for a higher 8-12 rep range with a slightly more advanced movement on that progression, for example L-Sit pullups. The main idea is that by hitting these various ranges, we are not allowing our muscles to adjust to the same range time after time, hitting them in different manners all the time so as to extract the maximum possible benefit from our training.

Some excellent articles for reference – highly recommended reading:

[https://www.advancedhumanperformance.com/blog/best-rep-set-range-strength-training](https://www.advancedhumanperformance.com/blog/best-rep-set-range-strength-training)

[https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/)

&#x200B;

**3.3. REST TIMES**

This article is possibly the best resource on strength and hypertrophy I have ever seen – you can see literally everything about strength training from here, although it is an exceptionally long read J

[https://sci-fit.net/scientific-recommendations-1/](https://sci-fit.net/scientific-recommendations-1/)

A notable quote:

“If you use shorter rest intervals you may need more sets to hit your target volume for each workout. Plus, you may need to adjust the weight because each set will become progressively harder to do (increased RPE).”

The basic idea though is that rest times are merely one component of strength training and the other components need to also be in order to maximize gains. The recommended rest times for sticking to 5 rep sets though is around **2-4 minutes**. There is a really nice chart in the study that will highlight this.

&#x200B;

So to summarize:

\- **Stick to basic exercises**

\- **Use weight to overload the movement** so that you are limited to the 3-5 rep range

\- Perform **5 or more sets** with **3-5 reps per set**

\- Ensure that your volume (sets x reps) adds up to **around 25-50 reps total**

\- **Use rest times of 2-4 minutes between sets**

\- **Aim for higher frequency if you can**, but not to the extent that you the train the same muscles every single day with no break. Splitting the body into push + pull muscle groups is ideal, allowing one to train each up to three times a week.

&#x200B;

**3.4. DELOAD WEEKS**

When you have completed a cycle (no, not a steroid cycle :P) of strength training (which can be as long as you wish, but for a prudent guideline, **try an 8 week cycle**), then it is worth taking a week to **tone down the intensity of your training** in order to allow your body to “catch-up” and hopefully supercompensate for the accumulated training toil of the last few weeks by rewarding you with some sustained strength gains.

&#x200B;

This is known as “deloading”. In this week, it is recommended that you turn down the intensity of your training through various means (source and for more info: **Overcoming Gravity 2nd Edition, p160-161**):

\- Decrease the frequency of your training (i.e. less days of training in the week)

\- Decrease the volume of your training (i.e. less sets and reps per workout)

\- Decrease the intensity (i.e. drop your progressions a level)

\- Do some cardio instead of strength work

\- Take a total rest week (not recommended due to the negative impact of no training whatsoever - [http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/65/10/2862](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/65/10/2862) )

&#x200B;

Now, once you have done this deload week, you should be super fresh and (hopefully) stronger than ever. This is when it gets really exciting! It’s time to test out your new gainz!

&#x200B;

**3.5.** **MAX STRENGTH TESTING**

*Read some guidelines here –* [*https://www.scienceforsport.com/1rm-testing/*](https://www.scienceforsport.com/1rm-testing/) *(applies to weight training, but bodyweight training is no different – weight is weight!)*

To do this, you need to be fresh, so ensure that you didn’t train the day before, if possible. On the day, also be sure to perform a thorough warmup, especially of the muscles and movements that you intend on maxing out in your testing.

&#x200B;

The following is a useful guide:

\- Perform your usual warmup and mobility routine by doing dynamic stretches and other mobility movements like shoulder dislocates, german hangs, straight arm holds, but stay away from anything too strenuous

\- Once warm, do a few reps of your chosen exercise with no added weight (say 1 set of 10)

\- Do another few reps across a couple of sets, gradually working up the weight to where you can start attempting your maximum

\- Start doing 1RM attempts – for each successful attempt, add a bit more weight, wait a couple of minutes, and try again

\- Once you fail an attempt, the previously successful lift is your maximum

&#x200B;

Here is an example\* from my own training, where I tested my maximums on:

\- Pullups

\- Dips

\**This is included only for reference, so please feel free to skip this if you wish (my intention is not to self-promote, but rather to inspire*).

&#x200B;

**4.** **RECOVERY**

**What are the recovery times for strength training?**

Research has found both untrained and trained subjects showed an increase in resting energy expenditure 24, 48 and 72 hours after a high-intensity strength training workout ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18714225/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18714225/)). Another study ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12741861/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12741861/)) found that after performing eight resistance training exercises for three sets of 10 repetitions, subjects displayed the lowest strength levels 24 hours after the session; back to normal strength levels 48 hours after the session; and **maximum strength levels 72 to 96 hours after the training session**.

These findings suggest that at least 72 hours of rest between sessions is perhaps necessary to allow for all muscle remodeling processes to take place and complete muscle recovery to occur.

&#x200B;

1. **How Much Rest between Sets?**

Study: [https://www.unm.edu/\~lkravitz/Article%20folder/recoveryUNM.html](https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/recoveryUNM.html)

Some interesting observations to note for our purposes follow. The main idea here is that shorter rest periods correspond better to endurance training, whereas longer rests align nicely with strength training as the body requires a bit longer to reset itself for the next set. Inbetween these two, we have hypertrophy ranges.

**Muscular endurance**: 30 to 90 seconds

**Hypertrophy**: 1 to 2 minutes

**Power**: 3 minutes

**Muscular strength**: 3 to 5 minutes

&#x200B;

2) **How Much Rest between Sessions?**

It goes without saying that the longer and harder the workouts are (and generally strength sessions are super hard), there will be more muscle recruitment, but also more damage that requires longer periods of recovery.

In the same study above, it was concluded that: “*for untrained individuals and trained individuals a frequency of 3 and 2 days, respectively, per week per muscle group is optimal,* ***which translates to 1-2 days rest between sessions.*****”**

It should also be noted that this can vary depending on the other skill / endurance or other work the individual is doing alongside their strength training.

&#x200B;

**5.** **STRENGTH TRAINING MYTHS:**

*I absolutely love this article, it is all science-based and the claims are all backed by research. This was an awesome eye-opener for me, and hopefully you too can get some value from it:*

[https://blog.haloneuro.com/five-strength-training-myths-and-the-science-that-proves-them-wrong-a972f41a0375](https://blog.haloneuro.com/five-strength-training-myths-and-the-science-that-proves-them-wrong-a972f41a0375)

&#x200B;

**6.** **FAQs:**

**Strength training is boring – how can you make it more fun?**

If you find strength training boring, you need to keep your mind on the longer-term picture. The foundation of strength that you are building will be the bedrock on which all of your skills are ultimately established. Studying isn’t particularly fun either, but we do it in order to obtain knowledge that will allow us to unlock careers or entrepeneurial pursuits that will yield major benefits in the future.

I also don’t think that there is much time or room to be bored if you push yourself to your maximum every time you do strength training. Strength training in itself is a monster challenge, as you will always be right on the limits of what your body is capable of. This is a serious motivator, and in any case, there is nothing “boring” about being able to one-arm pullup or front lever without ever even training the progressions leading up to it.

&#x200B;

**Strength training doesn’t help in building skill – surely I am wasting my time?**

Nothing could be further from the truth. Most of the skills that you will encounter will require a decent level of strength to complete. Even for those that do not require immense amounts of strength, you will only be doing yourself a massive disservice by not taking advantage of the huge leap ahead you would receive by first training some foundational strength. Take a move like a one-arm chinup for instance – if you have spent considerable time developing your pull strength via weighted pullups, you can almost guarantee that when you try a OAC you will be lightyears ahead of a similar athlete who instead trained skill progressions only with the intention of building up to a one-arm chinup.

The strength you gain from basic compound movements like pullups evokes a sustained increase in testosterone levels, and which of course allows you to build even more muscle, including those more intricate muscles which are key to giving you the ability to successfully and safely complete higher level exercises or skills. ([https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1988.65.6.2406](https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1988.65.6.2406))

In any case, if you don’t believe this, let me actually show you! Up to this point in my training, I have only been focusing on strength training and have not practised any particular skill movements besides handstands and L-Sits. Now watch what happens with all those strength gains\*:

[https://youtu.be/Mq3Zx2NJJpw](https://youtu.be/Mq3Zx2NJJpw)

*\*Again, these are included only for reference, so please feel free to skip this if you wish. I should also note that these are not the end products by any means, but just serve to demonstrate that strength does indeed transfer nicely into the skill realm and kickstart your progress.*

&#x200B;

**What about strength training whilst cutting?**

This is a really good question. It would stand to reason that it will be tougher to make hypertrophy gains whilst in a caloric deficit. However, when it comes to strength, it is not as clear cut. Strength is certainly linked to muscle size, but interestingly it is still possible to gain strength even when cutting. In this article, the possibility of both hypertrophy and strength gains during a cut are explored – with positive news!

[https://sci-fit.net/bulking-deficit-gaining/](https://sci-fit.net/bulking-deficit-gaining/)

&#x200B;

**Personal lessons:**

Lastly, for what it is worth, here are some of my personal lessons from the strength cycle I did:

1. Don’t do strength training on consecutive days. There were occasions where I did this, and the drain on my physical resources was immense – this caused my recovery to take far longer.
2. Mixing hypertrophy and strength training is far more effective than just doing a single version of this. Throughout this training I alternated between the two, and the strength gains carried over nicely to the hypertrophy days, and vice versa with the increased muscle mass from the hypertrophy training.
3. Spend the time working on your basics. I know people hate to hear this when they’re rushing to climb the skill ladder, but the time is so well spent it is almost criminal to ignore it. Strength gains made now will, based on research, remain with you almost throughout your entire life, and the younger you start with this training, the better you will be served as you grow older (look at this article if you ever needed a reason to start building muscle right this second - [https://sci-fit.net/anabolic-resistance-sarcopenia/](https://sci-fit.net/anabolic-resistance-sarcopenia/))

Thanks for taking the time to read this post – I have been working on it a long time and if nothing else, it really serves as a reminder to me of what is possible when you really get your training in order. I cannot thank Mr Steven Low enough for his book, Overcoming Gravity. If I had never happened upon this book, I don’t think I would’ve ever got my training as structured and effective as it is now. I am so incredibly excited for the future, and all that I can say is – **WATCH THIS SPACE! :)**"

I started the program at 5-4-3-2-1. Today I reached the sets 11-10-9-8-7 of the program for pull ups so i decided to try the maximum that i could do and i was able to do 20 pull ups and for the dips I started the program at 10-9-8-7-6 and today i was on the set 15-15-14-13-12 so i tried my max and i did 35 dips.

If you make a planning it makes it really easy.

I tried the Egoscue exercises found in Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Body to help relieve my back pain. This is the step-by-step guide on how you can do these exercises to help relieve your own back pain too! (complete with GIFS!),airawear,1052,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6348vj/i_tried_the_egoscue_exercises_found_in_tim/,1491189300.0,"Hey r/bodyweightfitness, 

I read Tim Ferriss's book 4 Hour Body sometime back, and saw his chapter on doing certain exercises to help relieve back pain. These exercises are taken from the Egoscue Method, which is a method developed by ex-Marine Pete Egoscue to relieve pain in the body. 

I decided to try out the exercises, as well as film a video to show you guys how to do the exercises, in case the instructions in the book weren't clear enough. 

Hope this is helpful! 

**1. Static Back** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/HandsomeBonyBeagle)

*Steps:*

* Find a chair. Lie on your back and place your legs on the chair, ensuring that your legs are in a 90 degrees angle.
* Place your arms to your side at about 45 degrees from away from your body. Ensure that palms are up and your thumbs are touching the floor.
* Relax your upper back and flatten your lower back to the floor evenly.
* Hold this position.

**Recommendations:**

Hold this position for 5 minutes, and do it for 1 rep.

**2. Static Extension Position on Elbows** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/HardtofindWhimsicalGrizzlybear)

*Steps:*

* Start on the floor in a push-up position, but with your knees on the floor. Make sure your higher joints are aligned (i.e shoulders, elbows and wrists are in a straight line; hips directly above the knees.)
* Walk your hands forward about 15 cm away from your body. Replace your hands with your elbows (make sure it’s in the same exact position.)
* Make a light fist with each hand and pull them away from each other. Pivot on your elbows and turn the thumbs out.
* Push your hips backwards towards your heel. This is to place an arch in your lower back.
* Let your head drop down.
* Hold this position

**Recommendations:**

Hold this position for 1 minute for 1 rep.

**3. Shoulder Bridge with Pillow** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/OrganicBadAmericanbadger)

*Steps:*

* If you have a pillow, use it. If not, a thick book (like the Four Hour Body we used in the video can do as well).
* Lie on your back, knees bent and feet pointing forward.
* Place the book/pillow between your knees and apply a inward pressure (make sure it is constant, and do not release.)
* Relax your upper body and raise your hips and back up and off the floor.
* Hold this position.
 
**Recommendations:**

Hold this position for 1 minute for 1 rep.

**4. Active Bridges with Pillow** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/HotBlandGazelle)

*Steps:*

* This exercise is exactly the same as Exercise 3, but active. Do the same thing as Exercise 3 by placing the pillow/book between your legs and lying on the ground.
* Instead of holding the position, you are going to raise your hips and back up and down in a slow, constant motion.
 
**Recommendations:**

Do this exercise for 15 reps for each set. Do 3 sets in total.

**5. Supine Groin on Chair** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/RightAdventurousChicken)

*Steps:*

* Tie a sweatshirt or a hoodie to a chair using a double knot.
* Set up another chair near the first chair.
* Place your left foot on the tied-up hoodie and your right leg on top of the other chair (in a 90 degree angle.) Hold.
* Repeat for the other side.
 
**Recommendations:**

Hold each leg up for 10 minutes.

**6. Air Bench** | [GIF](https://gfycat.com/RigidMeatyHake)

*Steps:*

* Stand against the wall. Point your feet straight ahead and make sure feet and knees are width apart.
* Walk your feet away from the wall while sliding your body at the same time. Make sure your knees are bent at 90 degrees.
* Ensure that your ankles are slightly ahead of your knees as well as making sure your lower back is completely flat against the wall. Let your arms hang by your side, or alternatively you can place them gently on your lap. Keep the weight in your heels.
* Hold this position
 
**Recommendations:**

Hold this position for 2 minutes.

here's an easy (and free) scientific way to tell if you're fatigued or recovered,JBredditaccount,1051,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dmi4tx/heres_an_easy_and_free_scientific_way_to_tell_if/,1571931415.0,"I discovered this test in June and have been experimenting with it since then. I have found it to very accurately indicate if I'm overtrained or how close I am to overtraining. 

I discovered it when I was reading a review of an expensive heartrate variability training sensor, intended to detect fatigue in athletes, and the coach reviewing the device said that his experience showed the expensive device to be inferior to the Rusko orthostatic test. As someone who juggles martial arts, an active life and working out, I frequently feel as though I'm not recovering as I need to.

The test is easy. (You must take your first measurement when you're sure you're recovered, though, so you have a baseline for comparison.)

1. Lie down for five minutes. Do not move, think calm thoughts. This five minutes is to settle yourself.

2. Jump to your feet.

3. 15 seconds after jumping to your feet, measure your heartbeat. This will be a huge spike.

4. 90 seconds after jumping to your feet, measure your heartbeat. 120 seconds after jumping to your feet, measure your heartbeat. THESE ARE THE IMPORTANT MEASUREMENTS.

Got all that? Simple enough, right. Well, the first time you do step 4 you're going to get your baseline to compare all future measurements against. In the future, whenever your step 4 measurements (90 seconds and/or 120 seconds) are 10 beats per minute higher than your baseline... you're overtrained.

This picture will show you what I mean: http://www.ilog.ca/help/188.gif

The idea is that a healthy body has a heart that performs with great variability. An overtrained body is very stressed and doesn't permit it's heartbeat to relax during even minor exertion (standing), keeping bpm measurements in an elevated range. 

Now, measuring the heartbeat accurately was a challenge. Taking my pulse and counting to six would work, but I didn't feel it was as accurate as it could be. I bought a cheap wrist monitor and it did not work at all because it took fifteen second to give me back a heartbeat reading, which was a pain in the ass.

I didn't want to have to buy an expensive monitor, but two free apps on my Android phone did everything I needed. Heart Rate Monitor by REPS and Screen Recorder - No Ads by Kimcy929.

The heart rate monitor works by holding your finger over the camera on your phone. That's it. Unlike other apps, as you're holding your finger over the camera, it gives you a live reading of your heartrate (and you can hold your finger there for as long as you want). Other apps did not do this: you held your finger over the camera and in 10-30 seconds they would give you a reading. This reading was live and continuous.

The screen recorder app simply let me record the heartrate reading displayed on the phone. This was important because I didn't need to look at the phone. Believe it or not, the act of holding the phone up and worrying about if I was getting accurate readings was enough stress to skew the readings. So after I jump to my feet, I just dangle my phone at my side with my finger on the camera and then go back and watch the video of my screen in order to get all the data I need.

Here is all the useful information I was able to get on this test:

A bodybuilder's experience going from weights only to calisthenics-based training.,Little-Delay-2616,1046,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1271mdx/a_bodybuilders_experience_going_from_weights_only/,1680215819.0,"Today it has been 3 years since I started doing calisthenics-based training.

  
I started doing calisthenics-based training as a result of gyms closing down due to the pandemic in 2020.   
Previously, I had been training with weights (Bodybuilding) for approx. 7 years and during this time period I achieved incredible strength and size results coming in at 5ft8 200lbs at 15%BF. At this point I felt like I was close to reaching my natural potential in terms of muscular size and strength.   


Due to my ignorance I always thought that calisthenics was all for show and that it wasn't an optimal training method for increasing size and strength. I knew about pull ups and dips and I did include these exercises in my workouts but always at the end of my back/chest days. Keep in mind, I primarily train to gain size and strength I do not care about calisthenics movements such as human flag, muscle ups, barspins etc. I was eager to not lose size and strength until the gyms would open up again.  


Nevertheless I had no choice but to specialize in pull ups and dips variations for upper-body as these exercises were the ones with excellent load-potential. Initially, I started training without any weights attached and was amazed by the pump that I could achieve with these exercises doing high volume. My lats, shoulders, chest and arms felt amazing and sometimes even better than training with weights in my gym. As I got stronger and more accustomed to bodyweight movements I started implementing direct arm-work (as I used to do in my gym for years). Bicep-focused chin-ups, bodyweight curls (rings), triceps extensions on low-bar, impossible dips etc. For legs I started doing pistol squats as that was the only challenging squat variation I could find.  

I started seeing even better strength results and wasn't bothered about going back to the gym. I bought a weighted vest, heavy dumbbells (80lbs to 110lbs) that I used to load my pull ups/dips and dumbbell squats for legs, and the muscular gains that I've made during these 3 years have been  absoulutely incredible despite having 7 years of previous lifting experience. I am currently at 205lbs at 15%BF, thus I have gained 5lbs from when I started which is amazing considering my training experience.    


Here are certain points of improvements that I have noticed about my physique:  


**-** **Bigger arms**. For some reason my arms respond incredibly well to low-bar triceps extensions combined with bicep-focused chin-ups/bw curls. I have finally achieved 18-inch arms despite being stuck at 17 inches for more than 4 years at the gym. 

**- Wider back.** I have always had a nice thick back and traps but for years I had been working on adding width unsuccessfully. I thought I was just genetically built this way but doing tons of pull ups (weighted and BW) since 2020 has improved my lats and has given me a much better V-taper.  

**-** **Healthier/better shoulders.** Before I started doing calisthenics-based training I would frequently experience shoulder discomfort while doing heavy bench-press or other push-movements. Specializing in ring dips has greatly improved my shoulder mobility and strength. In the beginning I was struggling to do 10 reps of dips and now I can easily do 10 reps with 90lbs added weight.

**- Core strength.** I used to believe that I had a good level of core strength when working out in the gym. I had achieved a 550lbs deadlift which I thought was a good indicator. But doing calisthenics movements requires a different level of core strength in every exercise that you do regardless of it being weighted or not. For example, exercises that requires you to stay in a plank-position (low-bar triceps extensions e.g) used to be incredibly hard at my BW but now it feels way more natural and less straining. Best way to describe it would be that I feel more athletic compared to when I was doing weights only. 

All in all, I can definitely recommend making the move from weights to calisthenics-based training if you feel that you've hit your natural potential or if you have plateaued in the gym."
30 Day Push-up Challenge,Bravestorm4,1044,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dbfhwl/30_day_pushup_challenge/,1569866508.0,"This is year three for me doing the 100 push-up challenge for the month of October. I’ve increased by 100 each year so now I get to do 300 for each day for the month. That’s 31 days or 9300 push-ups ladies and gents. 

If anyone wants to join me on this journey you’re more than welcome and throughout the month we can PM and keep each other accountable! You don’t have to do the full 300 you can do 100- or heck if that’s too high set your own goal! We’re all in this together!

Good luck everyone!

EDIT:

In regards of some questions I’ve been getting here are some answers for y’all. 

You don’t have to go through all 100 at once, I cap out at about 25 at a time and do sets of those. However you feel comfortable doing it or splitting it up is fine!

The challenge of it is pretty simple. The only thing you have to do it hit your goal for that day whether it be 10 or 300

Once you hit the limit 15/50/100/300 etc. for the day you’re done and don’t have to do any more. No extra requirements

The style of push-up doesn’t really matter for this. Remember it’s kore about self improvement so any way you feel you can get through them, do it!

Reminder that this isn’t a competition and it’s more for self improvement and positivity. Encourage each other! I believe in all of you!"

(~185 to 141lbs) M/28/5'5""- Strength training every other day with gentle cardio most days, tracking macros and nutrition carefully and totally life changed!",RossyRossy,1033,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kxte0k/one_year_update_185_to_141lbs_m2855_strength/,1610712855.0,"Hi all,

I'm super happy and proud to say I'm one year in to my fitness journey which all started here! I'm almost 150 workouts in and can't believe how much my fitness level and strength has changed since then. A massive thanks to all those on the sub who helped me start out, gave me tips and allowed me to keep up the effort. I've come a long way since starting bodyweight exercise, and while I've progressed to using some gym equipment I have still *never* set foot in a gym. It can all be done at home, honest!

My current workout routine is still every two days - which usually works out around 2-3 (sometimes 4) times a week which gives me plenty of time to rest inbetween and get my good 8 hours sleep. Most days I walk the dog as a form of cardio, and my wife and I have recently invested in a treadmill for when the weather's too poor. A quick 30-40 min walk at lunchtime on that makes me feel a lot better and gets some gentle cardio in to my routine.  My mental health has improved immensely and I'm still keen to keep mixing it up and seeing how I can work toward a higher level of strength and fitness, it's a great way to give me routine and cure my anxiety, especially during COVID.

As a bit of background - I began dieting late 2019 but started strength training properly in Jan 2020.

My big change for 2021 is to start building on my strength base. I've upped my caloric intake whilst keeping a real close eye on my nutrition, and I think it's really helping. I'm happy with my appearance and fitness currently, but I'm working on increasing my strength and technique.

**Exercise Routine**

It's been a full year since I started with the RR, and it was 90% bodyweight exercises then. I was looking for a home workout with minimal equipment, and that worked exactly as I hoped. Since then I've moved home and now have much more space to add equipment, which gives me some extra challenges. I still make sure to keep my bodyweight exercises within the routine.

My current equipment consists of a pull-up bar, pair of dumbbells and recently a kettlebell to increase my options. I use furniture around the house to assist, but being in the UK not many houses are particular well suited to hanging rings from the ceiling, etc, especially my one!

I always aim to do a routine every other day. On good weeks I can get 3-4 workouts done, but as long as I manage to squeeze in two sessions I see that as a win. I don't let it interfere with my personal life, but as I work from home I can quite often find an hour or two to fit it in. I also do a lot of dog walking to contribute with some gentle cardio.

I currently just have the one routine fresh for 2021, trying out new things but I'm hoping to create an alternate second routine to fill in the gaps;

Routine 1:

* Hip Raises (3 x 9)
* Hanging leg raises (3 x 8)
* Push-ups (3 x 15)
* Side Plank ( 3 x 35s)
* Pull-ups (3 x 8)
* Y-T-I Raises (3 x 9)
* Tricep Extensions (Dumbbell) (3 x 9 @ 9 kg)
* Bench Press (Dumbbell) (3 x 15 @ 9 kg)
* Bicep/Hammer Curl (3 x 11 @ 9 kg)
* Woodchop (3 x 14 @ 12 kg)
* Weighted Crunches (4 x 15 @ 12 kg)
* Kettlebell Rows (3 x 8 @ 20 kg)
* Goblet Squats (3 x 10 @ 20 kg)

I feel like I can really see the progressive overload happening already this year. I'm definitely more easily able to up my reps with subsequent workouts, without impacting the rest of my routine. Heavier weights and more sets have been challenging but focussing on form really helps me manage the extra strain.

I recommend the free app 'Strong' to track workouts I take around 30-45 second breaks between sets, and the routine takes around 1hr 15 min - 1hr 30 mins including a short warm-up and dependent on if I have to take a work call!

**Diet**

I've upped my calories significantly for the time being. I'm on around 2700 cals per day consisting of almost entirely healthy, nutritious options, or as close as I can. It's been useful during lockdown as there are little temptations when socialising!

* Breakfast - Overnight oats with seeds, peanut butter, greek yoghurt, etc.
* Lunch - Eggs, low fat sausages, high protein cheese, beans, salad
* Dinner - Smoky bean chilli, curries, or other lean meat meals (usually beef, pork, chicken or prawns) with a smaller portion of carbs (pasta, small wraps, rice), many veggies (carrots, green beans, onion, mushrooms, butternut squash, peppers), salad. Mixing in more carbs recently too.
* Snacks - Greek/icelandic style yoghurt, fruit smoothies, almonds, protein shakes (1 a day with milk)

When I was losing weight I was ensuring I was in a calorie deficit, somewhere between 1700-1900 cals a day. I'm quite short so my calories tend to be on the lower side. Tons of protein and much lower carbs and fats while losing weight.

I slowly ramped this up toward the end of last year with a view to stabilising my weight, and eventually I settled on around 2200-2300 as an approximately maintainence value with my level of activity. It took a good month to really work this out.

I then slowly upped my calories til I saw the scales start to move. It's early days but I think my target of 2700 is about right for now. Just going to keep checking daily and average out my rate of weight change, to see if I'm around the right figure.

For those who are interested I use this to work out my TDEE: [BMR Calculator](https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/).

I try to avoid chocolate, cakes, or other processed snacks. We cook from scratch for almost everything, which is great as I can completely control what goes in. We barely use any oil for cooking and our meals are still super tasty without the need for extra fats from oils or dressings.

**Plan moving forward**

I'm enjoying the progress I've seen in January already. I'm keeping a close eye on my reps and tracking my progress, as well as my weigh-ins daily to ensure my rate of weight gain doesn't go much above 0.5-1.0lb a week - I don't want to spoil any progress I've made to burn off the fat.

I'd really love some suggestions for a second routine to fill in the gaps. I'm currently thinking of re-introducing the Front Lever back into my routine, as well as some more leg exercises. Any suggestions on good uses of heavy kettlebells too? I've bought an extremely large 20kg sand/cement kettlebell which is great for squats and rows, but not very appropriate for swings or other single handed exercises.

Wishing you all the best for 2021 in your fitness journeys and I hope I can help people just starting out as I did a full year ago! My advice is stick with it and make time to fit it in - and don't panic if you miss a workout or two! Every little helps and you've still got to live!

N.B. I'm not personal trainer or nutritionist, but if you'd like some honest opinions or have any questions feel free to drop me a message! I hope I can help."

100 pushups a day - caused a lot of shoulder issues :-),bsdguides,1021,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/onxh0c/100_pushups_a_day_caused_a_lot_of_shoulder_issues/,1626767130.0,"Hello there,

i was inspired by one of those ""100 Pushups a day for 30 days and see what happens"" videos and decided to try it. No idea how many days it took me but eventually i was able to do 100 pushups a day and actually became pretty fit and strong.

At some point however my left shoulder started to hurt - like from one day to the next. I think its due to shoulder impingement because i really worked and even grew my front delt. 

Haven't done pushups in a while due to this but would like to start again. What exercise would be best to offset this push motion? Maybe mounting a pull-up bar halfway in my door frame and pulling up, as to have an exact 'reverse' movement of the pushup? Or a face pull?

Thanks!"
PSA: It's VERY important to stretch legs after a workout,lost_soundwave,1023,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/apk8zt/psa_its_very_important_to_stretch_legs_after_a/,1549915061.0,"I'm making this post so that other do not make the same mistake I did. 

&#x200B;

I'm in my late 30's and a few years ago I hit the gym with serious dedication. I bulked up and was hitting the gym 4 days a week in an upper/lower body split.

&#x200B;

The lower body workouts were things like kettle-bell squats along with lunges, box squats. I have a lower back issue so normal squats were thrown out. On the weekend I would do cycling in my hilly area.

&#x200B;

I would always stretch my upper body but not lower body/legs - all I would do is warm down on treadmill for 5 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Then one day I went with my office group for laser tag, during that sesison there was a lot of squatting up/down from cover. After the session my legs really ached, yet no-one else really complained when I asked them if they felt this way too. From then on I suffered an ache when squatting down and just general tight muscles and increased muscle cramps.

&#x200B;

It really made me feel old because I felt it every time I squatted to pick something up or tie a shoelace. I thought it was just a muscle injury through over-use so I just eased off the leg exercises and stuck to bodyweight squats etc. I took out the leg extensions from the machines. 3 months passed, 6 moinths, 12 months and the ache was still there. 

&#x200B;

Then I went to physiotherapy and they told me that I had no serious muscular problem and gave me a bunch of stretches and leg strengthening exercises to do. I kept at these for a little while but I was still convinced that I had something seriously wrong with me so I eventually gave them up. 

&#x200B;

I had a blood test for rhumatoid arthiritis - that came back negative (I was also scaring my mother by asking if there was any family history of this disease). I eventually got an MRI scan the results of which pointed to nothing serious. 

&#x200B;

Not wanting to curtail my desite to keep active and be outdoors I still kept the cycling going. I did a charity bike of 55 miles and got a free sports massage at the end of it. While there the massage therapist told me my legs muscles were really tight. She recommended I do foam rolling. I did that and also another sports massage session which helped in the short term. 

&#x200B;

Then this last Christmas 2018 I was at home on annual leave, I was surfing YouTube videos of curing leg/knee issues when I saw a random YouTube comment saying they cured their leg ache/tightness by stretching out their legs several times a day for 6 weeks. I was ready to try anything by this point so I got a whiteboard and committed to stretching at least 3 times a day for 6 weeks.

&#x200B;

How did I get on? Happy to say that I've experienced a dramatic improvement in my leg ache. It's pretty much gone.

&#x200B;

My routine was:

&#x200B;

2 or 3 times a day doing this:

&#x200B;

\* calf stretches (really feel the stretch), 60 seconds each leg

\* quad stretches (knee pointing at ground), 60 seconds each leg

\* hamstring stretch, 60 seconds each leg

\* bonus sretch I threw in: paleolithic squat (aka ""caveman squat""), 60 seconds

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

See photo for how I recorded my progress. It can be challenging to do all 3 when you're working full-time. Sometimes I didn't do 3 but just did 2. I just made my best effort. I found it hard to get up and do them after I had eaten dinner in evenings after a long day at the office. I just made sure to do it first thing after waking up. During the working day I also made sure I did a 20 minute lunchtime walk and when warmed up I would do a cheeky calf stretch in an emty meeting room.

&#x200B;

Seriously I cannot under-estimate how relieved I am. My next steps would have to get referred to an orthopedic surgeon! I feel younger, fitter, stronger, happier, more positive... it really was getting me down.

&#x200B;

So to all you older guys and gals out there really going at the lower body exercises... please stretch out thoroughly after!

That is all."

Embarrassing question here...,Whatchuon,1010,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mqb20o/embarrassing_question_here/,1618346340.0,"Hi guys. I'm a 14F (5ft 6in, 138lbs) who has just started their fitness journey about a month ago and I have a question. (I'm super insecure about this :( )

Am I the only one who cannot do a single push-up???

Like as soon as I get into the starting position for a push-up, I'll get down but from there, I just can't push myself up. Like at all my arms give out on me. I can do knee ones but only like 10 in proper form before my arms give out on me.

What's the problem??? Is it maybe because I'm too weak around my arms or is it cuz my butt is too big. I don't know but I really want to be able to at least do 5 push-ups in a row.

How can I fix this? It'd be appreciated if you guys could point me out some advice, maybe some tips or even a video that has helped you before.

Edit: OMG guys I never would have imagined so many answers lol. Thanks to everyone. I may not have answered all the comments but I've seen and liked ALL of them and it makes me so happy to see others come and help me. Much love. <3"
I have finally reached my goal of a pull-up after 3 months of training!,MarcinOstrowski,1008,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jdzcbi/i_have_finally_reached_my_goal_of_a_pullup_after/,1603104131.0,"As the title suggests, I have gotten in up the morning and felt really good which made me think today might just be the day, follow along.

For background, I have done some powerlifting in the past (for those of you who don’t know, it’s the squat, bench and deadlift) and never focused on body weight exercises. During the pandemic I have put some weight on and got out of shape (up to 93kg heaviest I’ve been for 181cm) and that made me want to lose a bit of weight and get fit again. 

I started with just doing random pushups and some stair running, no more than 1800kcal a day. I 3 months I have dropped 10kg (81.4kg. Currently)

Anyway on to the pull-up progression as most of you are reading for this probably. 
26M and I’ve never completed a pull-up, it was always a goal of mine but I have never trained for it. At first obviously I tried and failed, so for a few weeks I focused on scapular pulls and dead hangs. After 1 month of those I tried the negatives but they gave me tennis elbow so I decided to do Australian pull-ups which I didn’t find had any transfer to the pull-up. 

The big change came after 2 months when I tried a chin-up, I found I could do 1 and it was downhill from there really. I decided to drop pull-ups for time being and focus on chin-ups to get some pulling strength. Grease the groove method worked its magic, from being able to do 1, to 2 then after a couple of weeks I cracked 6 out. Day after that, boom I have done 2 pull-ups!

Tl:dr 
3 months after training body weight, focus on chin-ups has led me to 2 pull-ups"
"You know how you have failed so many fitness plans? Well, just humour me and read this....",uksoxfan,1013,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ak7nps/you_know_how_you_have_failed_so_many_fitness/,1548553993.0,"I was like you. I AM like you. I am not super fit but there again I have not totally disrespected my body over the years. However we could all do more right? But we don't. Our ""inner pig"" gets the final say on so many occasions... I'll cut to the chase:

I devised a plan for me. And over a year later I am still going strong. Believe me, I have given up on so many things in my life but not this! Go on then British guy, just tell us already!

My criteria were a) make it like a game or challenge that would hook me like a drug and b) don't make it too hard that I'll inevitably fail after two weeks. So in short, make it fun and make it easy (to begin with!).

I called it ""The 100 Club"" and I and a friend have been hooked ever since.

It is simple.

For every calendar month you have to ""cross off"" 100 boxes. So to begin with we printed off monthly charts with 100 boxes to check off. 

Then, make your own ""settings"". And in the first couple of months, keep it easy! And then progressively make it harder. And you can be creative in how you do it.

Here is my example. In my first month I could cross off one box by doing any of the following:

1km walking or running

100 reps of anything (press ups, sit ups, dumb bells etc)

And that was it. Simple. I told myself I had to on average cross off 3 or 4 boxes every day to achieve it. Oh and by the way, did I mention that you are not allowed to fail? Failure is not an option, hence why I said keep it simple at first..... Keep the 100 boxes on your fridge to keep your focussed each day. Get your friends involved and it becomes more addictive.

Wind on nearly 2 years and now I do the following per cross off:

100 press ups 

5km cycling

2km running or walking

5 mins planking

So as you can see, you can be as creative as you want.

Can I just say at this point, JUST TRY IT for one month. Set it up now. Make it achievable! And when you come to the end of the month you will feel great and perhaps ready to make your settings slightly harder. Don't make them too hard too quickly though. That can be fatal in terms of motivation.

And you may think ""well if it is too easy, what's the point, it won't make me lose weight and get stronger etc"". Well you are wrong. Just the mere fact that you have to get out in the fresh air or do 100 press up a day is perhaps something you never did before. And the beauty of it? If you miss a day due to sickness etc, no worries, just recalculate what you need to do before the end of the month to get it done!

In 18 months I have only failed twice and that was due to sickness....

Would be happy to hear back from anyone who read all of this and anyone who has just drawn a ""february chart"".

I would say good luck, but you won't need it. With the right preparation you are going to stick with this for life now.

It will retrain you psyche into a new way of thinking and respecting life's vehicle which is your body.

Here is a link to my first month. As you can see I incorporated how many times boozing I allowed myself in a month (10)....

Starting out I was wiggly as hell on the rings. The static hold, dips, and even push up variations were tougher than I imagined. Now, 3 months in and I’m using way stricter form on everything and my reps have went way up. I train 4 days a week with a 
push/pull/rest/push/pull/rest/rest split. Workouts last about a hour or so with a 2 min rest between sets. 
I’ve gained more definition in areas of my body especially abs, since I basically use them every workout either directly or indirectly.  I’ve gained strength and noticeable growth, especially in my shoulders, back, and triceps. I’m usually sore the day after every workout. 
My future goal is to master the ring muscle-up. I’m close but I need to gain more strength on the transition. 
In short, rings are amazing! They’re versatile, they’re low cost, they challenge you, and the different progressions almost seem endless. I may never go back to weight training.

My tips for using exercise to help out during tough times,None,1007,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aog6a1/my_tips_for_using_exercise_to_help_out_during/,1549629888.0,"I'm currently going through some personal issues and wanted to share some things I've been doing physically that has been helping me out:

Don't force yourself to do a whole strenuous workout. Know that you will get back into it eventually. 

Listen to your body - if you are hungry, eat, but don't over force anything. But at the same time you need to rebuild discipline eventually. 

Do simple movements as you go along the day, stuff like simple stretches and movements. I do Kickboxing so just throwing a few loose punches when I'm waiting for the kettle to boil for example, feels good. 

Keep on your feet and walk outside, get fresh air. 

Just move around. 

Tense your body to release stress/tension. 

Warm showers. 

Drink water. Green tea has also been helping me. 

Lastly - talk to people and try to be around people even if you don't feel like talking. Writing out what's going through your head is also good for me. Seek help, you are not alone, you are loved. 

If there is anymore I will add on. Hoping this will help somebody. :)

Went from my gym member ship to calisthenics. I could barely do 3 pull-ups or 10 push-ups at that time. Now my personal record are 22 pull-ups and 139 push-ups. Also learned the frontlever (Max 3 Second hold) and straddle (10second) and 10 straight leg muscle ups.. in this period of Time I did not use any type of supplements , but might go and start taking some in some months. Thanks to bodyweightfitness , the posts helped me out in my progressions and my motivation!

I followed the RR for about 4 months but then tried to work more on skills , aswell and my own routine. The routine wasn’t more than just trying to find out , what gave me the best feeling in my chest for example. I tried maxing out my push-ups , and bought several resistant bands so I could get more pull-ups and work on my form. A very big difficulty to that time , was getting a muscle up. I wanted to do them so badly , so I tried and tried , but had such a bad form. The result was a bad injury in my shoulder what made my progress pretty slow. In that time , I started watching more educational videos about calisthenics , dieting etc. I started to eat as many calories as possible , talked to different people what food could be the best. I stopped drinking sodas like Pepsi or coke , started to drink mostly water. I made myself noodles or rice , to eat them at school. I started to hear inside of me , what my body needs in order to get the best results. 

My current routine for chest is : 

5 sets 8-10 reps of ring dips
3 sets of 10 elevated push-ups 
5 sets 8-10 reps of pseudo planche push-ups 
3 sets 8-10 reps of bar dips 
3 sets 8-12 reps of diamond push-ups  
1 set of max push-ups + wide push-up hold (max)

My current routine for back is : 
5 sets 5-8 clapping pull-ups 
5 sets 5-8 wide pull-ups 
5 sets 5-8 close grip pull-ups 
3 sets 8-10 chin-ups 
3 sets 5-8 chin-ups (close grip)
2 sets 8-12 rows on rings 
Max reps with normal pull-ups (last rep max hold)

current routine for legs :

15 Squats
2 sets of 5 Pistol Squats (each leg)
2 sets of 5 Single Leg Hinge
2 sets of 10 Foward - Reverse Lunge
2 sets of  8 Split Stance Squats
2 sets of 10 Lateral Lunges
2 sets of 20 Single Leg Calf Raises
Max out squats


Before every workout I work on my muscle ups , levers etc.

Study shows Chin-ups and Wide Grip Pull-ups pose higher risk of shoulder impingement over shoulder width Pull-ups,Flipcel,1000,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/rumz8j/study_shows_chinups_and_wide_grip_pullups_pose/,1641167025.0,"[Scapula kinematics of pull-up techniques: Avoiding impingement risk with training changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916995/)



Very interesting. I've always known (and perhaps everyone here) that wide grip pull ups are dangerous for the shoulders. What got me is how the chin up is riskier than normal pull-ups. I was under the (wrong) impression that the external rotation from the chin-up created more space in the shoulder complex, thereby reducing the chances of shoulder impingement. I was wrong. Regular pull ups might be the way to go for anyone with shoulder impingement and those who want to avoid it. How about neutral grip pull ups?

**TLDR:**  *High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk.*"

Hello bodyweight fitness, this is my update of 1 year general conditioning, 2 years taking calisthenics seriously. from my first update to now i have gained 15+ lbs and have progressed a bit with my strength as you can see from update to update. on update 3 i have gained numerous skills including the maltese, 10 front lever pullup's, back lever hefestos also with archer variants, ect. for my future goals I am working on my rings strength and is something i am serious on pursuing moving forward. if you would like to ask me anything ofcourse you can comment or message me . of course i make this update in hopes to inspire at the very least one person feel free to follow me on instagram and ask me anything through there i am more likely to respond (@mytrainingarc). I will cover a 3 topics so let's get into it

Mental Plateaus and breakthroughs

[Visual Representation of what im talking about](https://imgur.com/a/QdIKhVW) (limiting belief being that you cant surpass your goals)

When you set goals you naturally put them on a pedestal considering you spend your energy and lots of time chasing them, with this being said the longer you train the more impossible it might seem. You naturally begin to develop learned helplessness subconsciously after attempting and attempting with no success. My point being here is that you have to teach your mind that your goals are achievable and that you can even surpass them, lots of the time its not a physical plateau that you have reached but a mental one. An example, your goal is a maltese, you teach your mind that the maltese is possible by doing the very maltese with bands, and that you can break these limits by doing exercises even harder than the very maltese, maybe maltese press ( with bands) or with some other type of assistance like a spotter

&#x200B;

How to make sure you are making progress

[my workout template](https://imgur.com/a/uOjWPWM)

the secret is time, consistency, a brain! most of the time you will think you have reached a plateau, you will have to look back on your periods of success and your periods of failure and see what the difference is (keep a workout journal, and just make a workout template), look at the variables for example time of day, compare and contrast. From my experience the biggest variables are Intensity and Volume you want as much as both as possible to make 1 gazillion percent sure that your body is adapting this has worked for me throughout my trainings. now the brain part, be Specific with what you train and what you want to achieve. You want planche?  train the very movement you want to achieve (dont do movements like ppu, leans, or progressions, while they might help you condition the movement the only way to learn the movement is by doing the very movement adapted to your level, again increase resistance by using bands or a spotter or a million other ways, this applies to every single body weight movement i can think of)

&#x200B;

ENJOY your workouts!

last but not least enjoy your workouts! at some point i was so obsessed with making progress that training just became a bunch of numbers, training became heinous! and i wasn't progressing at all :( then i took a step back and looked at the bigger picture training became special again! enjoying your workouts is what is what will keep you training

Edit: the only PED I use is caffein"
I made a free fitness app with 225 bodyweight exercises,rgomezp,1002,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1efe2oy/i_made_a_free_fitness_app_with_225_bodyweight/,1722295027.0,"In 2014 I weighed 140 pounds measuring above six feet. Naturally, I was teased by my friends for my lankiness / ""feminine body"". I always laughed it off, but deep inside it bugged me, and I knew I wanted to change.

But tracking everything was tedious. Most plans are on spreadsheets or PDFs which is incredibly hard to use. I also tried several workout apps but found several of them too complicated.

I decided to tackle this problem head-on and build a simple fitness app to make amazing workout programs easier to use because reaching your fitness goals is much easier when you develop good habits.

(by the way, the app is 100% free and free from ads, I don't make a cent)

I started with a simple one-tap set counter. From there, I just continued building it out slowly with more and more features like splits, videos, charts, and my favorite feature which is the muscle visualizer (I painstakingly mapped over 500+ exercises to which muscle it targets so that when you're done with your workout, the muscles are shaded from most exertion to least). I also like to draw, so I added 500+ hand-drawn images to go with workout plans and exercises.

After years of work (100% by myself), I'm thrilled to say that I managed to publish to both app stores (iOS & Android). For anyone who wants to start building a good fitness habit, give FitnessWolf a try and shoot me a message if you have any questions or feedback.

Again, I am not making any money from this, just a passion project I want to share.

First 20 pullups in my life at the age of 27.,None,999,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/p8t8fr/first_20_pullups_in_my_life_at_the_age_of_27/,1629558987.0,"It was a day where I skipped training due to lack of will for existence. Whole day passed by comitting to myself, doing things in my favor, having fun which I never have. At 7 pm I decided to get on a bike and at least do some kind if physical activity and ended up doing about hour of cycling. Yesterday was very big fool moon and I always pass this hotel in my city next to our famous Goranski park where's a partially new basketball playground. I really like it cuz the surface is painted in blue. Sadly this is one of two places where can I do pull ups in my town where your legs can freely hang so I decided to come here and test out my maximum pull ups in one set. I ended having most beautiful day in my life which I will never forget.

Tired of people saying that skills are easy!,None,998,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kmbc9o/tired_of_people_saying_that_skills_are_easy/,1609234899.0,"I am 190cm, and I learned the Front planche(my bad, meant to say front lever) , I have been working for it for around a year and a half (it was hard as hell) Everyday I train at the park and I see many people, of course they think that front lever is the easiest thing in the world, but this one guy, Yesterday he came up to me and said ""are you training calisthenics?"" I replied yeah and we talked a little, he seemed like a cool dude even though he was bragging about himself I just thought to myself ""hey its fine everyone has a little bit of a ego."" Then before he left he said that his ""calisthenics master"" friend will come tommorow. So its the next day (today) and his friend comes, not really lean but pretty jacked (manlet) and he asked me to show him some skills, I showed him my front and back levers, Tuck/adv planche, then he started telling me that its the basic skills, any novice can do that. I asked him to show me how he does it, he refused due to ""bad elbow."" They leave go to eat food or something then 20/30 Minutes later they come back and he shows me the handstand and says that its the most advanced bodyweight handstand.

I am tired of people who see the full planche and think that its easier than the pull up or handstand, I am not saying people should respect calisthenic athletes more just dont be a dick, it has happend to me more than 5 times where people take the time out of their day to say that my skill is easy and useless when they can barely do a pullup.

&#x200B;

EDIT: thanks for the support but I fucked up Instead of front Lever I wrote front planche..... Roast me if you want, hahah I can only do adv tuck and tuck planche."
So it turns out pull ups/chin ups are considerably harder on thick bars,Ungeheuer00,1003,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hzdt05/so_it_turns_out_pull_upschin_ups_are_considerably/,1595939429.0,"Lately I've been doing sets of 5 pull ups/chin ups **exclusively on fat bars** with 1 min. rests inbetween sets and so far I've built up to 8 consecutive sets of 5 (started from 3 sets of 5), after which my reps quickly drop down to 2 (pull ups) and 3 (chin ups). The goal is to do a total of 50 pull ups/chin ups as quickly as possible (my best time so far is 18 minutes or so). Again, the entire workout is done on a **fat bar**.

Today, towards the end of my workout, when I was already fatigued and was down to 2 pull ups per set, I decided to do a set of pull ups on a **standard bar** for a change. To my surprise I was able to do 4 max pull ups. I rested 1 min., went to the fat bar and was still able to do only 2 pull ups. Then I rested 1 more min., went to the standard one and did 4 pull ups again.

I knew that a thicker bar would challenge my grip strength, but I wasn't aware it would negatively impact my pull up/chin up numbers. The way I see it, when performing pull ups/chin ups on a fat bar, more ""power"" is being diverted to the gripping muscles in your forearm, and as a result, your back and elbow flexors (biceps, brachialis & brachioradialis) aren't working to their full extent. Would that still induce growth in your back and elbow flexors, seeing that you're recruiting less motor units than usual to pull yourself up?

My body generally feels much lighter when using a standard bar as opposed to a thick one."

Edit:   
I do have my app [https://www.cadoo.io/](https://www.cadoo.io/) to thank for alot of the motivation to keep the reps up each day. We've helped motivate thousands of people to reach their fitness goals and I recommend you give it a try :) 

**My learnings:**

""The BW workout gains have been good for me, and here are some of my favorite things about them""- No Excuses: No reason to not skip your workout. Get down on the floor and do your pushups.- Workout Anywhere: All you need is a floor- Cheap: Free to use the floor- Constantly stressing your body feels like it leads to better gains than a miss-mannaged PPL split.

**Story/experience:**

I got a gym membership and started going to the gym on and off over the last two years. I was never consistent with it, tried a push pull leg split, and just couldn't stick to the time commitment of spending 2+ hours at the gym each day (including travel time).

Getting into pushups and pull ups was definitely an interesting jump. When I started bodyweight workouts, I could bench 200 LBS and weighed about 195 BW. I could barley do 50 pushups a day and had a huge falling out when I first started. Did basically no exercise after the second week and took a month long break.

Bottom line was, I already had quit the gym so there was no going back and I knew committing to bodyweight workouts was what i wanted to do.

For my second try post-burnout, I took things REALLY slow, and only did about 10 pushups a day. Raising my limits only after I could consistently do it for 2+ weeks.

From committing to EVERY DAY workouts, the gains came fast and I was able to work my way up to 100 pushups a day where I stayed at for about 5 months. Eventually, I got the feeling of cheating myself as I was able to crank 100 out in the span of 5 minutes, but not have the energy to push myself past that.

I did the dumb mistake of not trying to ease myself into 200 a day and went straight for it. 200+ pushups was way too much and I again hit my peak and went back to less than 50 a day.

Now after learning my lesson twice, I know how important it is to slowly stack on the reps (and it's what I've been doing ever since). I've worked my way up to 200 reps a day consistently and think I can get to 500 reps a day given another 6 months of hard work."
"After 5 years of training and dissapointing loggers, I made one with us in mind",henryhs97,996,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ndwi9u/after_5_years_of_training_and_dissapointing/,1621195088.0,"Hey bros,

I've been doing callisthenics / bodybuilding for the past 5 years. During this time, I've always tracked my workouts. I started with a physical notebook, using excel sheets, then moved to smartphone apps, and never managed to find something I was genuinely happy with.

Seeing as I'm also a software developer, I decided to create my own app based on my specific training needs (and not what some over-commercialized amateur app thinks they are). I also added other features I found useful while training on a day-today and while asking my training mates for their feedback.

Thus, since the pandemic started, I've been developing a exercise logger app for people like us in mind and I wanted to share it with you in case you also find it useful. It's actually completely **free and has no ads**. I built it and use it for my own training. I'm quite curious to know what you think about it.

**You can use the web app** [**https://myworkinprogress.app/**](https://myworkinprogress.app/)

**or get it directly at the Play Store:** [**https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.myworkinprogress.twa**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.myworkinprogress.twa) (note: an internet connection is needed. Full online support coming soon).

No iOS support yet, but it's coming.

\---

Here are some things I focused on while making the app:

\- Ability to create my own custom routines (no pre-made routine stuff, I prefer to build my own routines and exercises).

\- Log my sets and have a see graphs/statistics of my progress for the specific exercise I'm training at that moment. The graphs show you your reps, weight, volume, max reps per weight, and more. It also lets you log RPE/RIR. Lastly, it always shows you your current PR in the logger, so you always have your max in mind.

\- Get useful statistics and graphs about my current workout, like total volume, duration, ability to add comments, and more.

\- I wanted to create specific goals for reaching certain lifting targets. For instance, reaching 100 reps in pull ups: 50 reps on day X, 55 on day Y, 60 on day Z, till I reached 100 on the deadline, etc. These goals then show up during my workouts so I can work on them and keep my goal in mind.

\- Most importantly, I wanted something **simple**. No bloated stuff, and no screens begging me to upgrade to a premium plan.

&#x200B;

I'd be happy to hear any feedback you have! I'm continuously improving it according to my training needs.

&#x200B;

*Disclaimer: Hope it's ok to post this here. There is no monetary incentive for me or anyone to people downloading the app. I just built it out of my own need and to improve my programming skills, and sharing now in case it may also be useful for others.*"
"Have you heard of towel pull ups? They develop crazy good forearm and thumb strength. Every 4th workout, i switch normal pull ups with towel pull ups - and you should too!",tykato,994,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5nysr5/have_you_heard_of_towel_pull_ups_they_develop/,1484417584.0,"# Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN9rjtPBibE

***

Hey athletes of /r/bodyweightfitness!

I'm not sure how popular towel pull ups are around here, but i absolutely love them. Some of you might know that i also train for bouldering/climbing, and i need a lot of finger strength for that. Towel pull ups helped me develop the needed strength. The thumb is very active in this pull up variation. As you might know, 9 different muscles connect to the thumb alone and move it. Yet, many people neglect their thumb strength - even though a strong thumb substitutes a big forearm!

* To substitute my forearm strength, i've started exchanging normal pull ups for towel pull ups every 4th or 5th workout. 

* It has increased my support and pinch grip tremendously over the last year to do this regularily. You should consider it, too!

* It's easy and cheap. All you need is something to hang two towels from. Just grab them with your fingers and pull up.

* You can lock your fingers with your thumb or just grab the towel normally.

* The bigger the towel, the harder (and better).

I hope i can invite some of you to try this exercise and make it a regular habit. I'd also love to hear you guys' feedback!

***

* Do you do towel pull ups already?

* What do you do to develop grip strength?"
Seen better improvements in my chest/arms after several months of rings training than from years of lifting,randomnessthoughts,992,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/j3j9t6/seen_better_improvements_in_my_chestarms_after/,1601593034.0,"Before the pandemic I had been lifting ~4x a week for several years already so I'd say I'm in pretty good shape. I never followed a strict program or anything... mostly fuckarounditis but I still had intermediate-level lifts (nothing crazy). However, when I was lifting regularly I always felt like my arms and chest lagged behind hardcore. I could bench 225lbs for 3 reps @ 165 lbs at one point, but I always felt like my chest was really lacking. Not to mention my biceps never really grew no matter how many curls I did. 

The only bodyweight exercises I really did before was pullups/chins (weighted and unweighted). So I'd say I had a decent base for bodyweight, but I had never really focused on it. 

Now when the pandemic started I first focused on mostly weighted pushups and pullups. I made decent progress with them, but it got boring fast. Around 3 months ago I decided to get a pair of rings and it was hard as fuck at first! I could barely do a few pushups on my first day, and I think I could only do 2 dips on my first day (super shakey). 

After a few weeks, I got more accustomed to the stability and progressed more quickly... soon I was doing up to 8 ring dips in a set. 

Now 3 months later, I feel like my chest and arms look WAY better than they ever did when I was lifting 4-5x a week. Some recent achievements on the rings:

* 16 regular dips (non-RTO)
* 5 RTO dips (turned out through the whole rep + below parallel ROM)
* Full back lever (can do advanced tuck front lever at the moment)
* 8 reps of weighted dips w/ 35 lbs

My biceps have grown especially, more than when I was doing 4-5 sets of hammer curls a day. I think that doing RTO holds and dips really helped my biceps grow. 

Current short-term goals:

* 10 clean RTO dips in a row
* OAC (pretty close right now)
* Full front lever
* Tuck planche (can already do a shitty one on the ground)

Eventually I'd like to be able to do advanced stuff like straddle planche and front lever pullups but it'll definitely take a very long time to get there. 

Just thought I'd share, might post some comparison photos if anyone's curious. Has anyone else here seen significant improvements in physique from rings? What was your routine/goals?"
Our Recommended Routine has 3 core exercises (the core triplet) so I made this follow-along video so we could do them together for the 8-12 reps with 60secs of rest!,Antranik,993,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9m6dxn/our_recommended_routine_has_3_core_exercises_the/,1538929893.0,"In the [Recommended Routine,](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) the end of the strength work is a [core triplet:](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/core)

* Anti-Extension progression
* Anti-Rotation progression
* Extension progression

I took the main pathway from each, so it's...

* Plank or Rollout
* Banded Pallof Press
* Reverse Hyperextension

# Video Link: https://youtu.be/QMY9c2wxFDM


The video is structured in a way that I explain how to do the exercise for less than a minute, and then start doing the actual exercise for 8 reps (do up to 12 if you can), so it mimics the intended structure as much as possible, where the explanation doesn't exceed the prescribed rest of 60secs in between sets and I try to give cues to help you maintain proper form throughout the exercises themselves.

The neat thing is that the ring rollouts and band pallof presses are easily scalable. And the reverse hyperextensions can be plenty challenging with all the different options possible that I offer. 

# Equipment needed

1. Rollouts can be done with rings or ab wheel or office-chair with wheels or clothing/furniture sliders on slippery floor. If you do them on your knees, you may need to use a yoga mat to cushion the knees OR prevent slipping.

2. Pallof Presses can be done with a resistance band or cable machine. They can also be done with rings but they are more awkward to setup. You can also hook the band around a door knob or something lower and do it kneeling, half kneeling or sitting.

3. Reverse Hyperextensions can be done using a bench, couch, ottoman, table, counter or GHR machine.

# Tip

* When starting out, choose the level you are most comfortable with so you build a solid foundation while minimizing risk of injury. 

* This is especially true for the roll outs.Doing variations you are not ready for can hurt more than help if you cannot hold proper form. Shoot for at least 12 reps before moving to a harder variation.

Well, I hope that helps! In the future I may make another core triplet video with the alternate progressions if you guys want it (or something else to suit the RR), but for now this is all I got. If you got any feedback or questions, please leave a comment! "
"I know this ain’t impressive to damn near everyone here. But, I just did my first full pull up",fishdick2356,993,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/16n4ycx/i_know_this_aint_impressive_to_damn_near_everyone/,1695164033.0,"I’ve been on a journey to get fit for…. A year now? (13 yo male) and I’ve been bouncing back and forth, losing motivation, stopping, changing styles and all that. So I haven’t made much progress. And I just recently, today as a matter of fact, decided to make the switch to purely calisthenics and weighted calisthenics. And, with that, lemme say that pull ups have always evaded me. I’ve always wanted to be able to do them, but as a skinny fat tall kid I struggle with them. A lot. But just a few seconds ago, I grabbed my bar, arched my back, took my feet off the ground, and pulled until my chin was above the bar, and I couldn’t be happier. Sorry to anyone who decided to read this, it’s not very exciting, but I just wanted to let people know. Off to start my proper bodyweight fitness journey, later

Adding an update: I’ve gotten better. I can rep pull ups now (2 lol), but uh, I’ve definitely gotten stronger, and I don’t have to rest as long before I can start again. Thank you all very much for the kind words and advice + motivation. And uh, maybe I’ll have some new updates in a few months. Later all

Second update: I can do weighted pull ups with 15 pounds for 3 reps, and 7 light pull ups. Im happy"

# Training:

Most of my training was started after getting a new job requiring 2-3 hours of commuting per day. This meant using half of my hour lunch and time between getting off work and my train arriving to have my workouts in a tiny office gym. So most workouts before Covid we're 2 separate 30 min workouts.

I relied a lot on machines and dumbells to ease back into bodyweight movements after my injury.

&#x200B;

|June-July|July-November|
|:-|:-|
|Play sessions - No plan|No Training (Injury info below)|

December - Febuary

Started a new job. 2 separate 30-minute sessions. Push/Pull/Legs split. 5-6 days/week but kept it low intensity. Averaged 2 - 15 min handstand sessions a week. About half of the exercises were dumbells/machines to help rehab. (Dumbell rows, overhead presses, basic machine work). Squated and deadlifted on the weekends when I had access to barbells.

March - May

Following a plan with very similar specs to [this one from steven low](https://stevenlow.org/how-to-program-for-advanced-isometric-movements-after-a-plateau/). I just did a few less total sets for the week than he suggested. [This is a screenshot of exactly what I was following](https://imgur.com/a/kYpUUcF). Completely focused on [RPE](https://soflete.com/blogs/knowledge/what-is-rpe) during this plan. Leg training was randomly thrown into workouts (assisted pistol squats, glute-ham raise using my couch)

# My Injury:

In mid-July 2019 I had a septoplasty surgery, to help with breathing and lack of smell. A month later, I had recovered and (thought) I was ready to start training again. I decided the best way to make up for lost time was to grease the groove with Single Leg Front lever holds (yes, I know, I'm not a smart man). On the second day of my plan, I felt a very sharp pinch in my lower traps on the right side. I continued to follow the plan... A few days later it was a dull pain, that was starting to spread to upper traps & neck. (Please note I also had TERRIBLE posture during this time while working, gaming, or drawing, which I'm sure made me more likely to get injured)

I realized something was feeling really wrong. I thought that stretching/foam rolling/lacrosse ball massaging would fix my pain. I continued to do all these things, and the more I did it, the worse the pain got. By mid-September, I could barely turn my head to look behind me, and it came with loads of pain.

I saw a chiropractor, got massages, I watched every video about back muscles, thoracic spine, shoulder joints, scapula stabilizers I could find and tried EVERYTHING I could with no avail. Finally, in early November I knew I needed a professional's help and went to see a physical therapist. 2 visits and 4 weeks of following a plan consisting of VERY LIGHT stretches and exercises, and my pain had finally subsided and I could turn my head without nearly any stiffness or pain.

By December I was 15lbs heavier than the beginning of my injury and lost a great deal of progress. I couldn't for the life of me get a muscle up after having done 4 perfectly strict 6 months before. I didn't let that get me down though. I was honestly just thankful to be able to train, as I spent many times wondering if I ever would again.

I now always keep an eye on how my neck and lower traps are feeling, and if I get anything even remotely close to the paint I felt during this time, I stop what I'm doing altogether.

Here's a [fun graph](https://imgur.com/a/s7VbQ8a) of my weight over the past year.

At a lot and pretty crapp-ily during my injury, which was the main cause of my +15lbs (Fast food a few times a week, guesstimating 3000-3500 calories a day). I did believe that if I maintained a higher body fat, I would lose less muscle while recovering. Having tested that theory, I don't think it was helpful to my overall progress. With bodyweight moves, it really comes down to how efficient you are with your weight, so maybe this would be more applicable to bodybuilding.

Since the start of 2020 I've eaten pretty clean. I love that the graph above reflects this super well. I've been aiming for 2500-3000 calories a day and minimizing going out for food. (Quarantine has made this easier)

Usual Breakfast:  Small bowl of oatmeal with peanut butter, hemp seeds, honey. I also like greek yogurt and granola.

Usual Lunches: Sandwich & kettle-cooked chips, beef or chicken with rice and broccoli.

Usual Dinner: Meat and rice dish with a vegetable, pasta, every once and a while something delivered from a restaurant.

I didn't track my calories at all this year, but I did spend a month last year tracking everything which taught me a lot about what I was putting into my body. I highly suggest trying this for a few weeks as you might be surprised by some of the things you're eating.

# Reflection/Moving Forward:

Okay, it took me writing this whole post up so far to be proud of my progress for this year. I know you're probably thinking, fuck this guy, of course you should be proud, but you have to understand my perspective. I caused myself to basically lose an entire year of training.

I have super high hopes of where my training will take me (One arm Front Lever, Planche, One arm Handstand). I know that these goals are on the edge of what is even humanly possible, so losing a year feels like a huge loss to me.

And honestly, I didn't realize how much progress I've made with the Handstand this year until I looked back at my last year's footage. I'm very thankful creating this post made me realize that.

Moving forward, its definitely all about injury prevention. And I've made a bit of a realization this past month about how I handle injuries. I am always reactive instead of being proactive. I wait until I feel pain or problems, then work on fixing it. Next year my goal is to be proactive and try to spend my time upfront, instead of after I recognize the problem.

Here are some other hopes for my next year of training:

* 5 Sec Perfect FL (Front Lever)
* 2 HSPU (Handstand Push-Ups)
* OAC (One Arm Chin-Up)
* Middle Splits
* Straddle Straight Arm Press to Handstand

I've just done my first push-up in 15 years!,matearss14,983,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/134khd7/ive_just_done_my_first_pushup_in_15_years/,1682942334.0,"Hey everyone. 

I'm happy to announce that after 15 years of depression, self-destructive behavior and overeating i just reached my first (tiny but important) goal. 

I started my diet last February and managed to lose 33kgs (130kg to 97kg) in a bit more than a year. Started some basic exercise this year, and in April i begun my bodyweight workout with the recommended routine. Today, after 3 weeks of training I wanted to see if I can do a push-up or pull-up, as those two are too difficult for me(doing incline pushups and leg assisted Australian pull-ups), and the pull-up didn't go well (however I can now hold my own weight for almost 5 seconds instead of not even 1). But then I did a proper, nose touching the ground full push-up. Last time I did that was in PE class in highschool.

Hopefully in another 3-4 weeks I'll be able to do at least 3-5 push-ups and maybe my first ever pull-up? 

I also have a question. Should I aim to do more every single workout (as in 1-2 extra reps of each exercise), or just when I feel that I can do more? I don't want my motivation to destroy my progress, but neither my anxiety to stop it."

I haven’t bench pressed in a year. The gyms reopened in the UK recently so I decided to see how much strength I’d lost on the bench... i repped my old 1rm 8 times then proceeded to set a new 1rm 20kg higher than before. I was astounded. I’ve never ever progressed this fast with any other training method. 



I’m especially impressed as i spent the first 6 months of the year basically messing around without a routine. Bwf is king!

I appreciate any advice you can give me.

This past year has been exceptionally hard for me battling depression and social anxiety. I was ready to give up on everything that I have worked towards these past few months, but I decided to continue to keep pushing forward. On top of my fitness goals, I start treatment for my mental health this coming week.

I know these pictures may not mean a lot to you (believe me, my chest is basically still a pancake lol), but these pictures mean so much to me. It's not about how I look. It's not about me proving myself to anyone. It's that while I was at some of the darkest points in my life, I continued to work hard at something without seeing any immediate results.

While words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated (as everyday continues to feels like a struggle), I did not post this for myself. I posted this for those who feel hopeless. Those who feel like they don't have the ability to change anything about themselves.

I wish you all the best on your journey! PM me if you need any words of support!

Age: 19

Sex: Male

Height: 5’8

Starting Date: 19 November, 2019 (weight 155 lbs)

Second Photo: 16 September, 2020 (I do not have a scale but on the 6th of September I was 162lbs)


Diet:

I did not measure out my calories exactly daily (which I am going to do in the future), but I aimed for 2550 the first 4 months and increased it to 2650 at month 5.  I had a period where I tried to lose weight. I kept my calories the same, but increased cardio and significantly cut back on added sugar.

Protein: I aimed for 75% of my bodyweight (minimum)

Sugar: I ate a lot of fruit so my overall sugar was above 30g a day, but I significantly limited my addd sugar intake. I aimed for no more than 20g of added sugar a day averaged throughout the week.



Exercise:

Due to my social anxiety, I hated going to the gym or working out in public (something I am trying to improve on...well not the gym right now because of COVID).

I implemented Matt D'Avella's  ""two day rule"", where I have a certain amount of workouts I need to do every-week, and I do not allow myself to skip more than one day in a row. This prevents me from giving up and making my ""two day break"" permanent.

I was and still am a beginner, so my routine is constantly changing.  Here is loosely what it has been the past few months.

(Every other day)

\- Minimum: 15 minutes of cardio (running or jump rope)

\- 30 minute workout routine of various types of push ups (clapping push ups, incline, archer, prowler etc.) many of the variants that I do I give my own name to, so I cannot remember the true names for all of them.

(4-5 days a week)

\- AthleanX Sixpack Promise iOS app routine (8 week program and use shuffle mode)

\- Going to start implementing more leg focused workouts soon

Sorry if this is not the most detailed. I keep learning new information so I keep changing my nutrition and workout routine as need be. Many things I still need to change and work on."
I can finally do a 1 arm pushup!,DizzyMint2,975,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/j4hz72/i_can_finally_do_a_1_arm_pushup/,1601742440.0,"Current Stats: 5""6, 17, 50kg (as of Sep 16)

Some background: started callisthenics about 3 months ago, to gain weight (started at 45kg). Along with this, I just though a lot of the calisthenic skills looked cool, and who doesn't want to look cool? When I started, I could say without a doubt that my chest was my weakest muscle. I could only do around 14 good pushups. That may sound like a lot for some people, but since I was 45kg, it made it easier for me despite not being that strong. 

Now 3 months later, I weight around 50kg (Last weighed September 16, waiting til October 16 to weight myself again) and I can do a 1 arm pushup for 2 reps on each arm. Doing 1 arm of all the go - to calisthenic exercises is a goal of mine, and i'm finally able to cross out 1 armed push up from my list.  Despite Covid-19 screwing over a lot of people, the fact that I have so much free time allowed me to get into exercise, and it is the best thing that ever happen to me. I understand that it's a lot easier for me to be able to do a 1 arm pushup at my weight compared to a normal weight person (i'm currently underweight), but this still fills me with so much pride. 

My advice for anyone trying to achieve a 1 arm pushups is to do psuedo planche pushups. Even though archer pushups are the go to progression, I think pp pushups are a great alternative. I had barely done archer pushups before, but I have being doing pp pushups and psuedo maltese pushups for about 2 months now. I don't think i've ever done a pushup variation that loads 1 arm more that the other. The strength you get from pp pushups will help you greatly in achieving the 1 arm push up.

Best of luck to anyone trying to achieve this!"

Grease The Groove Pull-ups: 100 days results,Dubski-420,975,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/x0j3xb/grease_the_groove_pullups_100_days_results/,1661760383.0,"I always wanted to be able to rep out pull ups like no other. I would consider myself an intermediate gym bro (for measure, max bench was 225 at the start of this). However, I could never do more than 4-5 decent formed pull-ups. No matter what kind of training, or progressive overload I tried, the number of pull-ups I was able to do just never really moved. I came across a YouTube video talking about Greasing the Groove, essentially doing about 40% of your max pull-ups (or other exercise), any time you had the chance. 

I decided to give it a shot, because why not. My max solid, all the way down pull-ups at the beginning of this was 4.5. I did not have a pull up bar at home, but at the gym, I would go and do 2 pull-ups every so often. Throughout a 1.5 hour normal gym session (usually 5 days a week) I would just go and do around a set of 2 pull-ups every 10-15 minutes. A few weeks went by and the two pull-ups felt effortless, so I started doing 3, and then 4, and then 5.. I never altered my other workouts, still worked chest, triceps,biceps, back, shoulder, legs,etc. like I normally did. Fast forward to present day, 100 days later, I’m doing 6-7 pull-ups in my GTG per set with ease, and with better form than the 4.5 I squeezed out 100 days ago. I maxed out on pull-ups for the first time in 100 days and I was able to do 14.

This barely felt like a training program, every rep I did during this time was extremely easy, yet I have 3x my max pull-ups in a span of 100 days. Gonna try for muscle-ups soon!"

In high school I was a heavy smoker, and somehow thought that being a musician meant I shouldnt work out.

Between 20 and 23 years old I discovered boxing and calisthenics through a friend and got into the best shape of my life. I was eating healthy as well. I wasn't bulked or jacked, I just had the ""healthy workout glow"" and my shoulders and chest were huge (for my standards, which is still pretty small).

I got into a toxic relationship in that time, stopped working out and never got back into it once we broke up.

Today I'm 30, I'm a family man, really happy with how life worked out. However my body basically became a blob. High fat, low muscle, and overall small arms, shoulders, chest, etc. My posture is really fucked up as well.

Yesterday I ran 2km, did a basic begginer calisthenics routine and then ran 2km back to my house.

Am I messing up by doing cardio - strength - cardio?
Can working out at this age do something at least for my posture ?

Thx!

Edit: Thank you all very much for your pointers. The general consensus is that, right now, doing something consistently is more important than overthinking it. Also, nutrition and yoga.

So for now im going to stick to this routine. One day yes, one day no (is that ""every other day"" in english?). After this post I'll look into adding Yoga on my rest days. I'll also cut the crap with my nutrition.

Again thank you all!"

\- other things i'm working on: dips (doing angled bar ones since i don't have parallel bars; at 6 reps maximum rn so i'm working on increasing them + hitting 90 degrees every rep), pistol squats (still doing them elevated + with weight plates for counterbalance), the handstand, and the L-sit (yay for the Skill Day Routine!).

Mastering easy exercises is better than speedrunning progressions (boring post for beginners),rhagoletiscerasi,960,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/tw2pqx/mastering_easy_exercises_is_better_than/,1649080811.0,"If you're a true beginner and struggle with pull ups and dips, and always have minor injuries, keep reading.

I see people treat exercises like chin ups and diamond push ups like they're not worth their time. So they just skip to what they call ""pull ups"" and ""dips"". These are the things I see the most:  


1) John claims he can do 30 push ups in a row. He tries ""diamond push ups"" one training session and he just did 12. So he jumps to dips, and starts doing dips every training session. He can do 8 ""dips"".  
Reality? Even his push ups have a horrible ROM. Chest doesn't touch the ground, body has no solidity and moves like some weird slimy substance, and he doesn't even go close to extending his arms. His dips are even worse. And the dips are so wrong they're not only useless but also risky.  


2) Pull ups. John doesn't reach deadhang, but that's ok. The problem is he doesn't even reach an active hang. and what about the rest of the ROM? Truth is, without a swing or such stuff he would only be able to reach the bar with his nose. He gets his chin above the bar with a crane neck and a weird swing. Johnny claims he can do 12 ""pull ups"". He keeps training his ""pull ups"" for months but the numbers stopped increasing.  


So what? Trying to fast forward your progress to boost your ego will lead to plateaus and injuries, and to a big hit to your ego. Most of us have been there. You lack the strength to do some decent form pull ups and want to avoid negatives? Stick to chin ups, or neutral grip (these are great if you're having issues with your joints). You'll give your lats some great stimulation. Once you master chin ups or neutral grip pull ups, you'll later try pull ups again and you'll see you'll have a better ROM and muscle stimulation.  
Same thing applies to dips. Don't stick to horrible form dips causing yourself pain. Go back to push up variations and you'll get there.  


TLDR: Beginners, don't progress to the next variation until your execution has full ROM and you have full control of your body (duh)."

Don't give up if you have tendonitis. I had tendonitis for 18 months. From 0 Pull ups to 3x5 +17.5kg,KangFitness,956,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nagmcm/dont_give_up_if_you_have_tendonitis_i_had/,1620794644.0,"Hi all 

Just for context. Just before the pandemic I had a very very bad case of elbow tendonitis. Golfer's in my case.    


I couldn't do many  things as the pain ranges from ( Scale 1-10 ) 6-8 , even very basic movements.   


I couldn't do push ups , dips , pull ups , chin ups , any hanging movements, deadlift , presses , curls etc. It was dreadful and I was nearing on depression.   


The lockdown happened about 6 months after my injury. In which I took a lot of time walking and doing mobility and flexibility work. I got a full pancake, pike , stand to stand bridge etc.   


During the entire 18 months I did not do a single upper body day.  

&#x200B;

Finally after seeing a physio back in October. Doing drills and ultra sound it slowly healed.   
In November I introduced eccentric push ups and pull ups.   


January 2021 I started adding full pull ups into my schedule.   


And today 4 months later I was able to do 3x5 + 17.5kg! 

[Recovery!!](https://www.instagram.com/p/COwcWQwJhCx/)

&#x200B;

All and all I've learned a few things whilst recovering. 

1. There's always alternatives to your training. Walking, stretching ,mobility works can do wonders! 
2. Use straps!!! Especially in the early onset of tendonitis. There's no shame in that. When it gets bad it gets really bad 
3. It won't heal completely. I've not made a 100% recovery and I don't think I will. I've learnt to live with it and modify exercises accordingly. 

That's my message for now! So don't give up! It'll get better!!"
"I created a short tutorial video on hollow Body, one of the most important core & ab exercises that you'll need to master and progress in bodyweight fitness & calisthenics. I also show 2 exercises you can do to progress and build up to the movement",gregoryscottfit,954,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5sat3b/i_created_a_short_tutorial_video_on_hollow_body/,1486338716.0,"What's up bwf community ! I hope everybody's having a gainful day

* In calisthenics it's critically important to have a good and strong hollow Body. It's used in 98% of movements. A push-up, pull-up, handstand, handstand push-up, Planche, back and front lever all use hollow Body ! When you fail to keep and maintain hollow Body you get what's commonly referred to as a banana back. Not only is this ugly but it's not optimal and creates bad habits.

* I personally developed a really ugly banana handstand and it's taken lots of time to get out of that bad habit and movement pattern 

* In the tutorial I show 4 exercises total. 2 to progress your hollow Body and 2 to build up to it 

* Progression exercises - hollow Body rocks & side to side hollow Body rocks 

* Regression exercises - hollow Body negatives with a static hold & hollow Body one leg extensions 


* Here are some examples for how you could work these into your programming 

* Beginner – 5 sets of 30 second leg extensions – 2-3 minute rests in between

* Intermediate – 5 sets  of Hollow Body Rocks 15 seconds superset Side to Side Hollow Body Rocks 15 seconds – 1-2 minute rest in between

* Advanced – 5 sets of Hollow Body Rocks for 30 seconds superset with Side to Side Hollow Body Rocks 30 seconds – 1-2 minute rest in between 

* You could superset these with some good pushups or good pullups. You could add these into a circuit.   You could do good strength sets at the end of your workout or you could add them onto one of the workouts on my channel.

How to Quickly Learn the Frogstand to Handstand,Uninformed1diot,944,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fz7e9x/how_to_quickly_learn_the_frogstand_to_handstand/,1586618481.0," The frogstand to handstand is a great skill to learn right after learning the handstand as it builds on a lot of the shoulder strength and balance gained while learning the handstand. While the strength it requires is significant it shouldn't be out of reach for anyone with a little bit of handstand experience.

&#x200B;

In this post I'm going to be outlining the best ways to gain strength for the frogstand to handstand as well as some of my tips when it comes to actually being able to do the movement while staying in balance.

&#x200B;

I also made this Y[ouTube tutorial for the frogstand to handstand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKb17UMf9xU&t=637s), which I'm actually very proud of. The information in the YouTube video and Reddit post is the same, just the video has examples of all the exercises and my commentary. I won't take any offence if you just want to read this post!

&#x200B;

**Prerequisites**

&#x200B;

The only real prerequisite for this is to be able to hold a good form static handstand for around 10-15 seconds, along with being able to hold the handstand at least a third of the time you attempt to kick up into it. This is just the obvious ""don't learn to run before you can walk sort of thing. If you can’t do a handstand there’s not much point in trying to learn this as you won’t be able to hold the top position and its not gonna look very good. Also in learning the handstand you get quite a lot of shoulder strength and knowledge about greasing the groove which is going to accelerate your progress when you try to learn the frogstand to handstand. 

&#x200B;

The other prerequisite is a basic level of pushing strength that we will talk about in the next section.

&#x200B;

**Gaining Strength**

&#x200B;

Assuming you are already training your pushing strenth, there are only really 2 exercises that you really need to do to gain the required strength for this movement. One of these exercises being a progression of the other.

&#x200B;

**Pike Push-ups**

&#x200B;

you should add these into your current routine such that you are doing around 3 sets of 5-8 reps of these, roughly 3 times a week. If you can't do 5 reps of these you should work on your pushing strength with easier exercises like standard push ups, dips etc.

&#x200B;

For the form of these, the most important thing is that you don’t flare your elbows out cos this can be pretty bad for your shoulders, it also uses your triceps rather than your shoulder which is what you want to target with the exercise, so make sure you keep your elbows tucked in. the second thing is that you should aim to get your nose at least a couple of inches in front of your hands at the bottom of every rep. almost try to lean forward as much as you possibly can, you’ll find it makes the exercise a lot harder. One way of thinking about it is that your body is supposed to pivot around your elbow and your forearm should stay roughly perpendicular to the ground all the time. 

&#x200B;

So lets say now you can do 3 sets of 7 or 8 of these, how to you make it harder, well, you can elevate your feet, and you can also do them on paralettes to increase the range of motion. Once you feel like it’s just inconvenient to elevate your feet any more you can move onto the next exercise.

&#x200B;

**Wall Handstand Push-ups**

  

These are much much harder than pike push ups, and not really necessary to be able to do the frogstand to handstand, but being able to do them does make it a lot easier so if you’re struggling with the balance aspects of it, you can just use these to get stronger and muscle your way through it if you want to.

&#x200B;

The form cues for these are pretty similar to pike push ups. Aim to rotate around your elbow and get yours nose decently in front of your hands. One of the most important things is that you try to keep a straight back, as arching it causes you to use your chest much more rather than your shoulders which we don’t want. Also make sure you lock out at the top of every rep, as this is what you’ll be doing when you actually do the frogstand to handstand, along with just being the correct way to do the exercise.

&#x200B;

You can still aim for around 3 times a week with these but maybe go for 3-5 sets of 3-6 reps, aiming for around 15-20 reps in total. When I first learnt the frogstand to handstand i was able to do 3 of these with perfect form but I think I was stronger than I needed to be.

&#x200B;

**Tips for Balance**

  

The movement is made up of 3 main positions and movements that you’ve gotta get your head around. 

&#x200B;

**Optimising the Frogstand**

&#x200B;

There’s two ways you can hold this position you have your knees on top of your triceps or kind of wrapped around them (this is hard to describe without the video). Having them on top cuts out a little bit of range of motion and makes the movement just a little bit easier, so I’d recommend this for when you start learning. I’d also recommend quite a wide initial position as this also cuts out a bit of range of motion and just makes it that little bit easier. Then when you manage it, you can start making your hands narrower to give yourself more of a challenge.

&#x200B;

**Moving off with the Knees**

&#x200B;

This is quite intimidating as it can lead to you smashing your face into the floor, so I’d recommend putting a cushion down in front of you. The key is to try to bend your arms as little as you can in order to minimize the amount you have to push up in the later steps. Starting in a less bent armed, more straight armed frogstand also helps with this. 

&#x200B;

To gain confidence and co-ordination you can try to rock your knees just a little bit up off your elbows and then put them down and you can just lift one leg at a time to gradually build up to that stage. When your ready, its just a matter of trying the full thing. When you start you’ll need to consciously avoid over balancing with your wrists.

&#x200B;

When you kick your legs out, try to keep your core engaged to avoid that banana back, its likely that your legs will feel like they are a lot lower than they are so keep that in mind. Its often very helpful to film yourself to make sure you’re doing it right.

&#x200B;

**Pushing up into a Handstand**

&#x200B;

Next you’ve got the push up into the handstand position. This is kinda what all the strength training is for but its your job to make this as easy as possible for yourself by bending your arms as little as possible in the previous steps so you have to push up as little as possible in this one. You’re starting from a slightly more than 90 degree handstand position and moving into a straight handstand. The best way to approach this is, rather than trying to go up really quickly into a handstand because you’ll definitely lose balance this way, you want to focus on just staying in balance in your current position and just trying to push up a little bit higher very slowly, almost focusing more on keeping your balance than pushing up

&#x200B;

Also try to stay in that hollow straight backed position and don’t let the banana back come into play. Besides just getting stronger that’s kind of the only advice I can give.

&#x200B;

Some other helpful exercises are 90 degree handstands and handstand push up negatives. When going for negatives, try to make the rep last as long as you possibly can. 90 degree handstands are just holding the middle position of a handstand push up for as long as you can.

&#x200B;

I hope this post helped you on your journey to learn the skill. I think it's a great way to start the journey of ""pressing into a handstand"" and can lead to lots of other nice skills like L-sit to handstand and pike press to handstand.

Training year round is better than training hard 3 months, getting injured, and going back to square one cuz of dumb decisions.

Edit: 

Two resources that have taught me a good amount:

https://antranik.org/tennis-elbow/

http://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/

Edit 2: I should reword what I meant. Going above the progression that you are ready for and compensating for that lack of strength is the problem. I linked a comment that words it better by a redditor here.
https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bn5xgl/slow_vs_fast_development/en4x4xo/

The key takeaway from my post was that going too fast was the bad part. PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD IS THE KEY. However, we forget the PROGRESSIVE part and stick to the overload. And the beginners who stick to too easy of a progression will not make as much progress because they are not pushing themselves hard and PROGRESSIVELY(which might mean slow for some people(1 week, 2 weeks...) and matters of days for those taking extra gear)"

Recommended Routine (RR) 4 Months Progress of Casual Beginner,robo-bonobo,941,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ildqva/recommended_routine_rr_4_months_progress_of/,1599075176.0,"http://imgur.com/a/Bq73hEB
23, 5'7"", 140lbs

Doesn't look like a huge difference, but I feel stronger and more confident! Overall, I would consider myself a casual beginner since my goal is just to stay healthy and active at home since I used to dance and do yoga frequently before the pandemic (equivalent to maybe 5-7 times of moderate to vigorous exercise a week pre-CoVid). 

Before RR, I could not do a single pull-up and only managed it assisted with bands, and also did not know the proper form for a regular push-up. The first 2 months, I did the RR every second day, so some weeks I did it 4 times and did yoga or moderate/intense dance on rest days. These physical activities on rest days are my hobbies and did them for fun, but my body quickly got tired and so I focused on the RR afterwards and now I just dance maybe once a week on a rest day. Became less consistent on the last half of the 3rd month and beginning of 4th because I got kinda depressed but I am still slowly trying to get back into being consistent and to find balance between pushing myself and also having self-compassion.

In terms of my diet, I eat relatively healthy but I don't count my calories and I just try to keep in the back of my head to eat a little more. Haha so definitely not that serious. I have a history of disordered eating and counting calories and being overly worried about my diet has been bad for my mental health as a teen. I know I'm making slow progress because of this and other factors but I'm happy to be progressing nonetheless. 

**Current routine:**

**Warm-up:**

100 jumping jacks

Dance-type warm-up of shoulder and hip joints

These probably aren't ideal for warm-up because they are kinda cardio, but they're fun and it's been working for me. :) 

**Round 1:**

Assisted pistol squats using door frame: 3x8 

(on other days I do Curtsy lunges 3x8 with 30lb weight) 

Pull-ups 3x8
(other days I do Chin-ups 3x8)

**Round 2:**

Ring hamstring curl 3x8
(I couldn't find a comfortable space to do Nordic curls in my home and I found this as a recommended progression on here)

Ring dips 3x8

**Round 3:**

Ring horizontal rows 3x8

Archer push ups 3x4 (or Uneven push ups 3x8 using a yoga block) 

Diamond push ups 3x8

**Round 4:**

Kneeling ab wheel rollouts 3x8

Pike hanging leg raise negatives 3x8

Copenhagen plank 30s each side

Arch body hold 30s

Hollow body hold 30s

**Round 5:**

Seated dumbbell bicep curls 3x8 25lbs

Single dumbbell front hammer raise 3x8 30lbs

**Round 6:** 

[Wrist strengthening exercises by Antranik](https://youtu.be/T58Gmo77Iow) (when I'm not feeling lazy) 

Palm pulses on hands and knees

Back of hand push ups on knees

All this takes me about 2 hours. Some days longer, some days shorter depending on my energy and motivation level or if I get distracted. I like to listen to podcasts or audiobooks while working out. Sometimes I dance around to the music I'm listening to during breaks or I end up singing along for too long (I do these all in my bedroom soo...). Or some days I water my plants or clean my room and get distracted during breaks and my breaks are too long. But I almost always finish it once I've started.

TLDR: it may not be perfect but slow progress is progress :)"
1 year of handstand attempts - what I've learnt,ArachNerd,936,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/i5xg5l/1_year_of_handstand_attempts_what_ive_learnt/,1596885272.0,"I couldn't handstand when I started in august last year. I was also bad with sports. Started with very basic stuff - wall planks. I kid you not, I could barely hold myself up there for more than 15-20 seconds. First few times I couldn't even move closer to the wall. But slowly, with practice, patience and persistence - it happened.

Climbing down from the wall was very scary. I fell a few times but not badly, never hurt myself. Little by little I noticed increased flexibility in my hips from learning how to climb down. 

After a few months (maybe 3-4), I noticed I could hold a full hollow body hold for a minute without problems. Something I've never been able to do. That was the time that I noticed I could do a bad version of front splits too (something I could never do before either).

Little by little I learnt how to kick up, keep my body in one line, stretch properly, do cardio, flexibility exercises, light yoga and bodyweight fitness. I am happy to say that now I am training for oversplits, I can do basic holds of 5-6 seconds freestanding, pancake, pike, do a proper push-up (but need to work more on that) and I'm somehow proud of my achievements.

Helped me with mental health a lot as well. My point is, if you don't see progress with exercise - take it slowly, wait it out and do not think about the end goal so much. The journey is far more important. Keep going. :)

From 6 to 10 perfect form pushups!,FragrantMoo,933,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k8mu1l/from_6_to_10_perfect_form_pushups/,1607367320.0,"I started working out about a month and half ago following RR. I've always been incredibly inactive, overweight and stupidly weak. I was pretty awful at sports and always sat out of physical education back in school. I guess I always thought I was genetically unlucky and was destined for a pretty sedentary lifestyle. Thinking this way pretty much forced me into said lifestyle which resulted in more fat and God awful posture that made me view myself in even more of a toxic and unhealthy way which literally controlled my life.

Anyway, I could go on and on with sop stories but the point is it was feeling sorry for myself that led to such an unhealthy lifestyle in the first place. Like many others I came across r/bodyweightfitness and lurked for a long ass time. Then, like many others again, the big C hit and I decided to give it a ruddy good go and picked myself up some rings and a pull up bar. And low and behold I couldn't even do a single push up. But guess what? This time I didn't give up and beat myself up. And before I knew it, and with a lot of perseverance, I was able to push out 6 perfect form push ups! I think it was then that I realised that this toxic lifestyle that I'd forced myself into was just a big sham my head produced as an excuse for not being as fit as I probably should have been. 

And to top it off, after a fair but of consistency in terms of max rep range, I was able to push out 10 perfect form pushups today which was 4 more than my max reps last session! And every push up set after the first 10 was still higher than last week's max rep! I don't know if something just clicked in my body/form or what, but Jesus man I've never felt so damn strong! For my own development and progress, I couldn't be happier! And my posture is better than ever too! I even managed to pull off a turned-out support hold 5s longer than last session too. 

Sorry for splurging but I got so damn excited and needed to share it with you guys!

Making gains physically and even mentally, and it's only gonna get better from here! 

I'm 6ft1 and weigh about 174lbs

TL;DR 
Managed to max out at 10 push ups, which was 4 more than last session!"

I was inspired by /u/3umel's ""Bodyweight Skill Tree"" post and the informative comments from a few days ago. At first I tried to improve their chart but then I realized I wanted something that included the intermediate steps in each progression and excluded the ""legendary"" skills that I will never attempt.

I also decided to leave out prerequisites that span across progressions to simplify the chart. I assume that reading about these progressions will expose the reader to the necessary prerequisites.

My chart is based mostly on the progressions from the Recommended Routine and from Overcoming Gravity. It is humbling to see how far I have to go before achieving even one skill considered ""intermediate"". At the same time I find it motivating to see how much more there is to shoot for.

I made this in Excel so I'll watch this thread for a day or two then I'll try to include any suggestions and upload the spreadsheet and share the link. I'll also share an image and PDF version that do not include my current level of progress (assuming people seem interested).

**Edit #1**

Thank you all for your support and suggestions. Here is version two of the chart. I made quite a few changes. I'll make a third version for tomorrow. Lots of hyperlinks to add.

I decided to lower the bar for the level cut-offs. Instead of using the Beg, Int, Adv, Elite cut-offs in the OG2 chart I decided to use the Basic, A Lvl, B Lvl, C Lvl cut-offs. I feel this is more appropriate for non-gymnasts. I also found a few things that had the wrong levels so I fixed those.

I was always very active, football as a kid (soccer if you like) then swimming, then water polo for 6 years. In my adult life I did mostly swimming or gym. About 4 years ago I had a shoulder injury, it hurt a lot and I only tried to treat it about a month after because the pain didn´t completely go away, bad move.

During all this years I tried so many different treatments and saw 5 different specialists , I spent so much money on treatments! The injury, apparetly was nothing special swelling of the bursa, that lead to bursitis but all they manage to accomplish was to take the pain away while resting, every time I touched a bit of weight (even carrying groceries) the pain would appear again and if I tried to force it I´d go back to pain even at rest. It was really tough on me mentally, not being able to do anything, I was 26/27 when I had the injury, it was surreal for me that I´d not be able to do any upper body movements for the rest of my life like a senior citizen.

This year around February I slowly tried to use some dumbbells in the end of the cardio just to activate the muscles, like 2Kgs, eventually I progressed a bit without pain and tried to do some machines exercises for chest and back very light as well. After doing that for a month I asked one of the teachers for help and he planned a workout for me to try and gain muscle with very specific exercises to work around my limitations. About one month of that and I was doing those light exercises almost pain free.

In April he changed my exercises to start gradually increasing the weights and here I am today, almost pain free even though I still have to be very aware of proper form and stop if I feel an odd pain. But yeah, today I manage to do 3 sets of 8 pull ups(last set was realistic only 5 and 3 negatives) I know it´s nothing impressive at all but I´m just really happy about being able to train properly again! Hopefully it´s going to last and I can keep evolving, to me it really feels like some sort of miracle.

Yet it also means I could share these mistakes with you guys so hopefully nobody will be repeating them. I made a video (link: [https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU)) documenting my progress over the past year where I have gone from not being able to do a handstand at all to being able to do (1) 40 seconds of handstand hold, (2) 1 rep of handstand pushup and (3) press to handstand.

&#x200B;

I'm sure there are many handstand experts out there giving advice on how beginners should learn a handstand but some of them are simply too advanced for beginners to comprehend and incorporate into their trainings. So I want to share the advice that has worked for me at least as a person who has gone through the whole process:

&#x200B;

**1. Don't try your luck**

In the first three months of my journey, I relentlessly did handstand kick ups, hoping I could all of a sudden miraculously hold a handstand. But it simply doesn't work that way. My wrist flexors weren't strong enough and I simply didn't know what to do with the rest of my body (i.e. Abs, legs, lower back etc). Even if I could succeed holding for a few seconds at the top, there's no guarantee that I could do the same thing the next day. It's really frustrating and stupid to train handstand that way.

&#x200B;

**2. Maximise upside down time**

I like to think that the golden rule for training handstand is to maximise the time you spend upside down. That's the only way you could develop neuromuscular control over your body and not feel weird and out of control once you start doing a few seconds of free handstand. You could maximise your upside down time by doing 3 sets of at least 30 seconds of handstand hold against wall every workout. I recommend the chest to wall version and I still do it every single session.

&#x200B;

**3. Divide and conquer**

Handstand is a really complex move that involves coordination of various muscle groups. I find the yoga progression for handstand very reliable and it should be used as a reference for training handstand. This means doing a lot of frog stand and headstand. Training frog stand will help develop your wrist flexors' strength, range of motion and balance. Training headstand will make you become more aware of what to do with your lower body and abs. Doing these accessory work will help you fix your weak links in isolation and eventually develop the body awareness necessary to hold a handstand.

&#x200B;

**4.  Train press to handstand as soon as you could hold a handstand for 10 seconds.**

If you would like to hold a handstand every time, you should learn different ways of entry into a handstand. Compared to a handstand kick up, pressing into a handstand gives you a higher success rate because you could enter into a handstand slow and controlled. I started training press to handstand after I was able to do 10 seconds of handstand hold and that is around six months into training handstand (as you can see in in my video) and it has significantly increased my success rate since then.

&#x200B;

**The timeline for my handstand journey is something like this:**

I have hyperlinked the milestones and matched them with my video for the sake of convenience.

1-2 months: Fail/0 second ([0:11 to 1:28](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=11))

3-4 months: 5 seconds ([1:38](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=98))

4-6 months: 5-15 seconds ([1:52 to 2:44](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU))

6-8 months: Press to handstand against wall, free press to handstand attempts ([2:52 to 4:00](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=172))

9-11 months: Press to handstand ([4:00 to 4:15](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=244))

11-12 months: Free handstand pushup ([4:11](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=256)); 7 handstand pushups (against wall) ([4:35](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=275)); handstand press by the pool ([5:05](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=305)); 40 seconds handstand hold ([5:18](https://youtu.be/A6VYo4tT3IU?t=318))

&#x200B;

**Below are all the exercises I have done to train my handstand:**

1. Frog stand
2. Headstand
3. Handstand hold against wall (chest to wall)
4. Handstand hold against wall (back to wall)
5. Assisted handstand pushup (chest to wall)
6. Press to handstand
7. Handstand hold
8. Hollow body hold
9. Downward facing dog

Bodyweight Fitness App updated with Starting Stretching & Rest Timer (Android + iOS),mazurio,923,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5m6d5m/bodyweight_fitness_app_updated_with_starting/,1483622839.0,"Hi everyone,

Just wanted to let everyone know that the app has been updated with Starting Stretching & Rest Timer for both Android and iOS - it took Apple a while to approve the update which is really annoying.

The app now includes following routines:

* Bodyweight Fitness Recommended Routine

* Molding Mobility http://phraktured.net/molding-mobility.html

* Starting Stretching http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.html

You can tweak rest timer in settings. Please let me know how it works - if there are more settings needed then I will be more than happy to add them as soon as possible.


I also have a question to the mods - is it possible to add the app website (http://www.bodyweightfitness.co.uk/) and /u/antranik video to the RR FAQ? I keep seeing comments about people not knowing about the app or being confused about it.


There are few bugs around that I am already aware of and there are few advanced levels missing for Starting Stretching. Me and /u/Captain_Nachos (Nick) are hoping to bring them as soon as possible.


I also would like to thank for all the feedback I have been getting lately on the email - it's been great to hear about some of the issues I was not aware of.


Next I am hoping to bring some Grip Training with /u/tykato to the app :-).


There are still few minor things I am hoping to bring to the apps asap (graphs are still missing for iOS - sorry for that!). 


**As always you can download the apps from:**

http://www.bodyweightfitness.co.uk/

**The app is free, advert free and open source. There is Pro version for Android and Gold in-app-purchase for iOS if you feel like you want to donate :-).**


As always - many thanks everyone. This subreddit is the best and motivates me hugely to keep working on the apps whenever I have time outside work and studies.

Please send more feedback! :-)

Thanks,
/u/mazurio"

I've been doing the RR for just over 2 years. No previous strength training experience. Not amazing gains like some of the younger bros I see on this subreddit, but enough for friends and family to notice. My favorite part about this routine is accessibility. I just finished a workout from home at noon on a Thursday, while simultaneously caring for my 3yo who is potty training and my 6mo old who is teething.  Just wanted to say thanks to this community for helping me to fend off the inevitable march of father time."
Pushup compared to bench press - with calculator,TwoWorkOuts,923,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ini8og/pushup_compared_to_bench_press_with_calculator/,1599379226.0,"So I was trying to find a calculator that would compare the loading of various pushups to bench press but couldn't find one. So I did some research and made one for myself. I just though it would be fun to share this with others and see how it applies to real life. Also wrote few thought about what strenght level you should be aiming for.

If you wan't to read more about this go here:

[https://twoworkouts.blogspot.com/2020/09/push-ups-compared-to-bench-press-with.html](https://twoworkouts.blogspot.com/2020/09/push-ups-compared-to-bench-press-with.html)

&#x200B;

Here is a short summary about the subject:

\-1.5x bodyweight press would be considered an advanced achievement. 1.2x BW would be Intermediate level.

\-Two arm versions of the push-up (Kneeling, Standard or Decline) won’t get you to intermediate or advanced level. You’ll have to use at least one of the assisted one arm versions.

\-The easiest exercise where Advanced strength level (1.5xBW 1RM) can be reached is with 10-12 reps of the decline Assisted One Arm push-up. By doing 2-3 proper One Arm Push-ups you would also reach the Advanced strength level.

\-By using additional load at least 20% of your bodyweight the Two arm decline push-up allows you to reach intermediate strength level with 10reps. And advanced strength level with Assisted One Arm Push-up for 10 reps.

\-For bodyweight training rep ranges between 1-5reps might not be functional for all so I suggest tracking the 1RM based on how many reps can be performed at a moderate rep range 6-10reps. Higher rep count  above 10reps does not predict your 1RM performance very well.

&#x200B;

If just want to check out the load calculator go here:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q24swiy\_5rTo-x4fb7aPlZdEwMf881twGKVt6ALL3MM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q24swiy_5rTo-x4fb7aPlZdEwMf881twGKVt6ALL3MM/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to use this calculator Save a Copy to your own drive. (Go to File -> Make a Copy)

&#x200B;

But I encourage you to read the article I wrote or you will not get much out of the calculator. This helps you to plan progressions more clearly and have a some kind of idea how much load you are pushing in various pushups. For example when matching 1RM you will see how many reps you must perform in order perform x amount of reps for another exercise. So no more ""do random number of reps and sets"" to unlock the next move. Now you have a guideline to follow.

Personally I was suprised how much strenght the proper one arm pushup requires and found the reason with the calculator why I was not able to do more reps. The 1RM was too high compared to my performance level. So I need to get my reps higher on the previous exercise or use additional weight."
A List of Bodyweight Isometrics by Body Part,Prowland12,923,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/vu0h0t/a_list_of_bodyweight_isometrics_by_body_part/,1657249332.0,"# Isometric Exercise List by Body Part

For those of you who are not aware, an isometric exercise is simply a strength exercise where you are not moving. Exercises like the plank, superman hold, front lever, and handstand are all great examples of isometric exercises using bodyweight. These are all fantastic exercises with tremendous benefits for building calisthenics strength.

After reading up on isometric training in general, I have realized they are far more versatile than I initially believed. We can use bodyweight isometrics as a novel stimulus to build strength, hypertrophy, and endurance for any muscle group and nearly any exercise. The only limit is creativity and leverage, so there are an endless number of potential exercises to train.

My goal with this post is to collect a list of exercises that are safe, progressive, and immediately applicable to typical bodyweight training. I'll be focusing solely on bodyweight isometrics exercises using either no equipment or equipment typically available such as a pull up bar, rings, etc.

Much of this information is already scattered throughout the subreddit, but I wanted to bring it all together into one post for the sake of convenience.

**Benefits of Isometrics**

1. *Simple/Convenient:*  Because you are not moving, you simply have to get your body into the desired position and hold the exercise for a sufficient length of time. Therefore, they require very little technique to accomplish. Most bodyweight isometrics can be trained almost anywhere, making them super convenient.
2. *High Carryover:* Because you are able to replicate the positions of dynamic exercises, isometrics can have a high degree of carryover to the related movements. An example is something like the [isometric pullup](https://youtu.be/V6FDukR8-LQ).
3. *Low Injury Risk:* Holding still means there is a low risk for injury, as your joints and connective tissue do not experience much impact compared to dynamic exercises. At the same time, you are still loading those tissues, and so you can still reap the benefits of stronger tendons and ligaments with less wear and tear.
   1. The simplicity of most isometric exercises (listed in point 1), also mitigates the risk of injury due to poor technique.
   2. Note I said *low* injury risk, not *no* injury risk. You still need to use good judgement when training.
4. *Can Handle Heavy Loads:* Your body can be trained to handle very heavy loads when working isometrically, and you can train at angles that normally would be hard to replicate with conventional exercises. Isometric training was one of the reasons that old-time strongmen could pull off such bizarre feats of strength, such as bending metal bars and breaking chains by  [flexing the muscles of the torso.](https://youtu.be/K8iIP6HAvSU)
5. *Fast Progress:* Isometrics can be [a very efficient form of training.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4065110/) There is also an extremely large pool of potential exercises, giving you many options to increase difficulty over time.

**How To Train Isometrics**

1. *Timing Sets:* It will take a few seconds to get into position and start contracting at the desired amount of effort. *Do not count this set-up time as part of your working set*, start timing when you have hit the amount of desired muscular effort after a few seconds.
2. *Progression*: When training with bodyweight isometrics, the two variables for progressing are increasing the time of the holds, and making the leverage/load more challenging by either modifying the existing exercise, or switching to a harder related exercise. Once you have reached the upper time range for your specific training goal, move on to a harder variation.
3. *Angles:* Many of the isometric exercises listed below can be trained at multiple angles. If you are replicating a dynamic exercise, such as a curl, the angles can usually be broken down into 3 major points: top, middle, and bottom. Try all of them and pick the position that has the best muscle contraction for you. If you cannot decide which one is the best one, then go with the middle position.
4. *Sets/Reps Range:* Below I have provided a guideline for optimal sets and reps depending on the training goal. Generally, the more challenging the exercise is, the shorter the hold times. I have listed some example exercises for each goal, to provide a reference point of the ""sweet spot"" for different skills.
   1. *Cater your hold times to your strength leve*l. A complete beginner may need to start with short hold times on a beginner-level skill like a calf raise, while an advanced trainee may be able to hold advanced skills like a full front lever for more than a few seconds. For optimal progression, it is important to be honest about your skill level.

"You have six months to get as jacked, as possible. How do you approach it?",mt5z,921,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/yuyrg1/you_have_six_months_to_get_as_jacked_as_possible/,1668431019.0,"Let's say that you don't have to go to regular work. You don't need to worry about money for food or equipment (and everything else). Your goal is to gain as much overall muscle mass, as it's possible for you. Limitations are that you do it ""at home"", or rather without gym equipment, you can use only calisthenic movements (weighted too) and let's say few barbells or resistance bands for isolation. You cannot contact a professional trainer, use knowledge of yours and this, what is available for everyone with access to internet. Oh, and you don't use any hormonal help, stay natural.

How do you do it? How would you programm your training, what sets would you be doing, what mindset would you try to achieve? How would've it change what you're already doing in terms of training, eating and resting?

I ask to find some inspirations to optimise, for me and anyone reading. The question was provoked by overthinking how many sets should I really do, after I've seen some ""hollywood movie stars body transformation"". It's said that normally you don't want to do more than circa 20 heavy sets per muscle group per week, as it can start to killing your gains.

So yes, let's discuss.

EDIT:

.1 We all know that ""train hard, eat a lot, sleep a lot"" is the way, it's OBVIOUS, question is about details of optimisation of all this.

.2 Let's say one is not a complete beginner, can do basics in good form and just looks for not doing anything else for half a year, than just getting jacked

EDIT 2:

1 I see some misunderstanding of what ""as jacked as possible"" means. To clarify: get as many lean muscls as possible in the given time and under given circumstances. So (weighted) calisthenics and no steroids, 6 months  inspired by actors transformation), on your own (so many of us can use those advices just so)

2 It doesn't really matter, but no, I'm not going to jail any time soon, as far as I know 😅 I limited thema to calisthenics as this is ""bodyweightfitness"", right?

3 I didn't expect this topic to blow up like this! But I'm happy as it means that many of us can learn something from one another or review their own opinions."

One year push-up challenge for the lazy man.,svenz1997,917,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cc9qk9/one_year_pushup_challenge_for_the_lazy_man/,1562931511.0,"A lot of people, including myself, do not have the discipline,the time or strength to do 100s of push-ups a day. Either you do too many sets, and too little reps, or you do too many reps and cannot recover enough to do more sets. This is why I came up with an alternative challenge. The year is broken up into 17 blocks of 3 weeks each:

&#x200B;

Start by maxing out your ability to do push-ups, and round it down to a nice number. For me it was 23 so I decided my starting set was going to be 20 push-ups. If you can only do... lets say 10 or less, you start with less.

&#x200B;

Block 1 - Week 1: 20 push-ups once a day

Block 1 - Week 2: 20 push-ups twice a day

Block 1- Week 3: 20 push-ups three times a day

Block 2 - Week 1/2/3: repeat the above but add 5 push ups to each set

Block X - Week 1/2/3: And again

&#x200B;

You will end up with being able to do 105 push ups. Great results, and start of rather easy. It does not require you do push-ups during work, and you can spread it out.

I've worked out on and off for a couple of years, sometimes delving into a bit of calisthenics to switch it up. I just recently moved and have been working out 6 times a week for the past 3 months. 90% weights though, especially bench press.  


Before I moved I tried to work up to doing a one handed pushup but I always thought that it would take a million years for me to do it or that I would have to lose weight. I've actually gained a bit of weight and just hit the bench press hard and there it was.  
20 minutes ago I decided to try a one handed pushup just for fun, not expecting anything, and although it was tough (and my form probably isn't the prettiest.) It was super cool to see just how much stronger I've gotten and how it's helped my calisthenics.

Smoking weed was the same. I cycle too and from work 5 days a week (11KM a day) and found it was really making me wheezy. I haven't given up weed, but only use my vape now (MFLB if you are interested).

2 weeks ago I thought i needed a break from drinking and smoking, and my training has never been better. I'm leaning out more, carrying less water and have yet to have a 'bad' session. It's honestly made me so happy prioritising my health and training over getting wasted. I still go out, just stick to water and it's had no detrimental effect on my social life.

Hey folks! Nick-E Here.

This is just a post continuing to get the word out about the launch of the first of 5 routines we're coming out with in 2021 as an update/overhaul to the existing RR; the BWF Primer Routine!

Now if you haven't seen last week's announcement, I'd strongly recommend you have a look through there, because it provides some important information about all this.

[Check it out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kfqmhl/official_rr_update_new_years_new_routines_coming/)

In the last post we outlined our plans for all 5 programs, but in this post, I'll be going into more of a deep dive on the BWF Primer, as it is on its way into general circulation in the New Year!

As this routine is meant to be replacing a longstanding fixture of the subreddit, I will try to use this post to be as explicit about my reasoning and justifications for how the routine is structured and how it was made as possible.

# DISCLAIMER: BEGINNERS NEED NOT READ THIS NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM, HOWEVER, READING IT MAY HELP TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE ROUTINE IN TERMS OF 'WHY AM  I DOING THIS' or 'WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?'

Ok, onto the content!

# The Making of the BWF Primer Routine:

So in designing the BWF Primer Routine, a lot of thought went into both **what people who are new to exercise need the most**, and **how to best deliver that information effectively.**

With those two things in mind, the following factors were held up as the goal for what the BWF Primer should achieve.

1. The program should provide the tools to **learn what proper form is** for any given exercise, and enable the person performing the routine to **self-evaluate their performance**, and/or provide an avenue through which **others with more experience can check form**.
2. The program should allow for individuals to get started with **minimal barrier to entry**, and weave in reading with actual practice. This will space out the (unfortunately necessary and) relatively large quantity of reading required to learn proper form and understanding of training programs, thus considerably flattening out the originally steep learning curve.
3. The program should be structured in such a way to facilitate habit formation to help new exercisers get into the groove more easily.

With respect to **point #1**, this is something that the RR already did, and many free online programs already do. However, the high priority of this point is one of the reasons why the previous RR and many other free 'learn it yourself' programs have had such a high barrier to entry for non exercise-savvy individuals. There's a lot to read, watch, and comprehend before you can even start the routine.

Now some people find this absolutely trivial and can just sit down for an hour, read through all the material and get going on their first session. However, for many others this has proven to be a bit more of a difficult task and has resulted in feeling too overwhelmed and intimidated to start.

This is where **point #2 (and #3)** comes in. The solution to this in the BWF Primer is a 14 day 'building period', where there is an activity and/or reading to do 6 days per week. The building period allows people to start without having to tackle the whole routine on Day 1. Additionally, the 6 day per week structure will help build consistency while **also keeping the sessions short and sweet, atleast to begin with.** This will be explained below in the routine outline.

# The BWF Primer Routine: Outline

The purpose of the BWF Primer Routine is to take someone who has never exercised before/has not exercised very much before, and is not familiar with common exercises or principles of how exercise and training works, and get them to a minimally effective level of operation to start building strength and muscle.

In completion of the routine, you should be able to understand roughly how and why workouts are structured the way that they are, and how that facilitates improvements in your fitness. You will also develop competence in a series of fundamental exercises.

The exercises you should be able to competently and effectively do by the end of the routine are:

1. Push-ups
2. Horizontal Bodyweight Rows
3. Squats
4. Single Leg Glute Bridges
5. Deadbugs
6. Bird-dogs

**Push-ups and Rows** are your main *upper body* exercises

**Squats and Glute Bridges** are your main *lower body* exercises,

and **Deadbugs and Bird-dogs** are your main *core* exercises.

That list is also ordered in the most likely order that the exercises will be learnt.

# The BWF Primer Routine: Structure and Progression:

STRUCTURE:

The BWF Primer will start out with a 14 day building period (explained in the next section), building up to this workout shown below by the end of the 14 days, to be performed 3 times per week. (Ideally with one day of rest between each session, but if need be, you can do 2 sessions in a row. But not all 3)

&#x200B;

|Exercise|Sets and Rep ranges|
|:-|:-|
|Deadbugs|3x10-20|
|Birddogs|3x10-20|
|Row Progression OR Reverse Corner Push-ups|3x5-12|
|Pushup Progression|3x5-12|
|Glute Bridge Progression|3x8-15|
|Squat Progression|3x8-15|

In all exercises, as a standard baseline, we will work with 60s rest between sets (between the fact that 1. The work will be submaximal and 2. New exercisers need to develop better work capacity and inter-set recovery, more than 60s is likely not needed.)

\----

**PROGRESSION:**

\----

All exercises should start out very easy, and you should be able to add 1 rep per set (up to 3 sets of the upper rep range, e.g. 12, 15 or 20 depending on the exercise) every session. If you hit a plateau in the first two weeks you've started too heavy. If you did start too heavy and stall (or fail) for more than 2 workouts in a row, drop 2 reps per set and continue with the old progression scheme.  FOR EXAMPLE: If you fail to complete 3x9 two workouts in a row, you should go back down to 3x7 before progressing again.

If the above scheme does not enable you to progress past a plateau, many other methods (far more sophisticated than this) exist that are outside the scope of this routine that can be investigated if you need them!

\----

**END STATE:**

\----

You should be able to perform:

**3x8 pushups**

**3x8 horizontal rows** (body parallel to the floor at the bottom of the movement)

**3x15 Squats**

and **3x15 Glute bridges**

all ***WITH GOOD FORM*** before moving on to the next program (For now, that will be the RR, but in future it will be the **BWF Strength Foundation Routine**).   If you achieve one of these goals before reaching the rest, you may continue to progress in those exercises, or stay at that level and work on your form until all requisites are met.

(SIDE NOTE: **If you were doing corner reverse push-ups**, you should acquire something to do rows on and continue on this program until you reach the row progression, progressing everything else in the meantime )

\----

**\*\*\*A SIDE NOTE: RATIONALE FOR REP RANGES:\*\*\***

\----

You may be wondering why the upper end rep ranges for this program are so high. There's a number of reasons:

1. Due to the occasionally big jumps between progressions in BWF, its usually better in a program suited for the widest number of people to overestimate the level of strength needed to move on in a progression. If 8 reps of one progression JUST ABOUT gives you enough strength for 5 of the next (albeit maybe with not the best form), thats a needlessly rushed approach when alternatively building up to 12 reps in the former progression would allow for a comfortable acclimation to the next progression because it is well within your strength ability. In a way it sort of naturally periodizes the intensity of that progression rather than slamming your head into maximum intensity every single session.
2. Working in a variety of rep ranges is important for too many reasons to go into, and too many beginner programs just slam people either with 5s, or with 5-8's.
3. Specifically for the squats and glute bridge progressions, BWF leg work is inherently limited in scope due and so naturally to squeeze the most benefit out of it, you will need to work in higher rep ranges, because if you do not have access to weights then you will hit a ceiling extremely quickly. Therefore, it's much better to treat BWF leg work on the ""pump""-ier side of the rep range continuum.

\----

**\*\*\*SIDE NOTE: TOTAL VOLUME OF THE BUILD-UP PERIOD\*\*\***

\----

Yet again you might be thinking to yourself:

""But Nick! How could you! Beginners shouldn't train 6x a week, beginners should train 3x per week! 6x per week is far too much volume for our poor beginners and they will surely die a fiery death from:

***O V E R T R A I N I N G! ! ! ! ! !*** ""

If they were doing the full volume workout 6x per week, yes. That would certainly be likely to exceed the recovery capacity of a beginner athlete.

However:

1. The volume of each session will be reduced as exercises are added to ensure the weekly volume stays at a manageable level, and generally around the volume of the full routine (The current RR, for example, is 81 weekly working sets. The full BWF Primer is 54 sets of sub-max work. Week 1 will be around 45 sets, and week two will be 60. Of *very* sub-maximal form work mostly. There is zero chance of exceeding your recovery capacity as a beginner if you work in the guideline intensity)
2. The intensity of this routine is meant to be low for the 14 day build-up. The intensity of the sets are not meaningfully high enough to impact your recovery in this period because the purpose of this period is learning, not really pushing yourself and trying to make **huge gains**.

# The End.

So that's the BWF Primer as I've got it developed so far in readiness for the New Year!

There's still some finishing touches to go before it's ready, and it will likely continue to be developed to smooth out any rough edges (all programs have them when they are transferred from the perfect, lab-like ideal conditions in someone's brain to the wild and wacky real world), but the goal is to get it to a minimally effective state by New Year's so the first cohort of people going through the first 14 day build-up Community Workout will get a good experience!

I cannot do a single pushup.,None,902,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/khrqae/i_cannot_do_a_single_pushup/,1608589202.0,"Hi, I (19F) have pretty skinny arms and I cannot do a single push-up. I have two 2kg dumbbells at home... I've tried YouTube workouts and tbh I don't see much difference. 


Does anybody have any tips for me? Must I go to the gym (because I prefer to workout at home lol)? I don't want overly muscular arms but I definitely do want my arms to be strong and muscular. I wonder how long and how much work that will take me? 


For me, I think I lose weight quite fast with cardio, but when it comes to gaining muscles I just can't. :( It hurts good when I workout but when I wake up I don't feel sore..


Edit: thank you everyone for the overwhelming response. I wasn't expecting it. I've already incorporated some of the tips y'all offered. I'm really really grateful!!! ❤️❤️ I'm definitely getting my strong arms in 2021, and I'm gonna be able to do a push-up :)"
My 2 Month Transformation with Intermittent Fasting and Body weight exercises!,Any1-,897,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/habird/my_2_month_transformation_with_intermittent/,1592337729.0,"

What’s up guys! M/19 180cm 89.6kg to 80kg 🔥
Two months have finally past and I’m extremely happy with the result. I learned a lot about intermittent fasting on here and am extremely thankful for that! I lost lots of weight and managed to keep and additionally build muscle! Intermittent fasting works amazing when combined with body weight workouts!

Diet: 
Im currently on a 20/4 Intermittent Fast with Calorie Deficit at 1500/1600cal daily. My diet basically consists of Chicken with Rice &amp; Veggies and Pasta with Salmon. I know pretty boring, but it tastes good and I like it simple with my meals. I have a cheatday every Sunday where I try to consume 3500cal (I will eat anything) to work against the insulin resistance and so that my body doesn’t get used to the fasting. Don’t start with a 20/4 fast, slowly get your body used to it with a 16/8 IF. That’s how I did it. ✌🏻

Workout:
Something that is very important to me is working out every day. I work out every day, even if it’s just a quick 45min Bodyweight workout. I rarely use weights, only if I have enough energy left at the end. I do about 200 push ups in different styles and 50 pull ups. I use resistance bands for different exercises to train my triceps and biceps. But I usually do everything with my own weight. Additionally I go running about twice week. 
Regarding my Abs Workout I use the following plan with 40/20 (40sec working/20 sec break) usually go through all exercises twice but follow the order:

1. Toe touches 
2. Roll ins right/left 
3. Hips lift 
4. Cross crunches 
5. Slow Mountain-climber 
6. Toe reachers 
7. Heel touches 
8. Crunch + hip thrusts 
9. Toe touch hold 
10. Plank crunches 
11. Shin claps 
12. Explosives
13. Mountain-climber fast

If you’re interested check out my story highlights on Instagram. Got some progress pics and workout videos on there. This isn’t advertising, it’s for motivational and inspirational purpose.

Pushup EMOM (every minute on the minute) for an Hour Workout,mudfence,902,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/frzb0e/pushup_emom_every_minute_on_the_minute_for_an/,1585602522.0,"I've been trying to do this at least every other week since quarantine and figured this sub might enjoy. It's a truly nasty marathon-type workout if scaled correctly.

Pick a reasonable number of pushups that you can easily do unbroken in about 20 seconds (I initially started at 8) and do that number of pushups every minute for 60 minutes. Make sure you're locking out, chest to the deck, and keeping form on each rep.

The first 30 rounds I complete unbroken and then I have to start breaking it down into two sets to maintain form. By minute 50ish, I'm usually breaking it into 3 sets and sweating it out. For the first half, you should have at least 30 seconds of rest between each minute. By minute 40ish, you should have closer to 20 seconds of rest.

If you can't keep up with the number you selected, drop down for the next round. So if you fail at doing 8 pushups at minute 47, drop down to 7 pushups at minute 48.

I've gotten up to 12 pushups and have pretty much hit the wall at the 13. I'm always sore for at least 2 days after this workout. I personally saw pretty quick improvement and was able to jump a number every other week until 12. This is definitely a mindfuck of workout for me but I always feel accomplished after finishing it all the way through.

Pro tip: throw on something mindless to watch in the background. I usually re-watch Sopranos to keep occupied during the rest period."

How I worked myself up to my first pull-up at 41.,Drorta,896,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/q30mda/how_i_worked_myself_up_to_my_first_pullup_at_41/,1633578518.0,"I started about three years ago, losing 50 pounds thanks to r/loseit. Then I felt good enough to exercise a bit. I found this sub, and started doing the RR. It's definitely the way to go! amazing results.

But, I'm too lazy for it. It's not something I can keep up for more than a month. All efforts add up though, and those few months were great. I got some equipment for my house, among it was my pull-up bar. I had the faint notion of sometime being able to do one. I've never been athletic, but maybe? before I'm 50 and definitely old, I could pull myself up?I saw a video on building habit rather than buidling muscle. Exercise is anything you can do consistently, repeatedly, and with some kind of enjoyment. What gives me more joy? The push-ups! I started just doing 20 every day. Every fucking day. Sometimes, 40. My top was 80. Still not even the figment of a pull-up though.

The bar was there, mocking me whenever I gripped it. But it did work to build habit. I had gained back some 6 pounds, some of it was definitely muscle. Then I got into running. Just because of COVID I think. I was locked up, then I wasn't, and lots of people were happy to be able to run again. It should be fun! I worked myself up to running 5km straight, and I was enjoying it. It felt great coupled with my push-ups. Also running while listening to podcasts felt like nothing at all.

Just adding more push-ups felt very lopsided though. My wrist started to hurt ocasionally. I started improving form instead of adding more. Wow! form does matter. I played with push-ups a lot, and eventually I saw my dip bars. I made them myself out of wood, and they were just sitting there. I have the habit, surely I can add dips. So I was running two or three times a week, and doing push-ups and dips every day. About 20 and 10. Form on the dips improved, and I can hang really low.

The pull-up bar was still there though, looking at me. I went back to the RR to see what progression looked like. I just didn't click with it. It felt really strange. I went to youtube and started watching 1st pull-up videos. I tried banded, scapulars, arch hangs. Looking back, it was all grip training. It was my weakest point and all my focus was going to my grip no matter what the rest of my body was doing. I did a couple of things to my bar to improve grip. I added rows to my routine, and that helped with grip too. I do them on the same dip bars.

So now my routine was, push-ups, dips, rows, and fumbling with the bar. I went from every day to every other day, but with twice the sets. It just felt better. And running too, but winter hit and my running was cut in half. I hate running in the winter. Every now and then I would go back to youtube and look at pull-up videos. I saw one girl doing assisted pull-ups. Basically standing on a low bench, and pulling herself up with her legs on the bench. It seemed really silly but I tried it. Just the exercise of doing the full range of motion of a pull up felt like it was teaching my body how to move. I started doing those, and really putting in max effort, doing as little as possible with my legs. This worked great because I could do three or four reps and really work myself out, just regulating how much weight I was pulling and how much I was pushing. Very soon I started doing an assisted pull-up on my way up, and a negative on my way down.

Then, last week, I came back from my run. The bar was there, and I just jumped on it. My low bench wasn't in place, fine I'll just practice some grip. I hung there, and pulled a little, and a little more, and I was going up. I put in all I could and pulled my chin above the bar. I dropped and it took me a while to realize I hadn't had any assistance. I was dead, no way I could try again. I was eager to try the next morning, and yes, another pull-up. I tried again in the afternoon, nope. But the next morning again, with proper warm up, I pulled myself up.  


At 41, I'm the strongest, healthiest, fittest I've ever been. Thank you, Reddit.

[26M] I went from 11 to 17 pull ups in 30 days doing the Russian Fighter Pull Up Program,OptimusPrime1313,897,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8paz08/26m_i_went_from_11_to_17_pull_ups_in_30_days/,1528383532.0,"TLDR: Went from 11 to 17 pull ups in 30 days doing the Russian Fighter Pull Up Program.


I recorded my max reps and thoughts on the process in this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t8eVgTwS3A


To see my initial rep max, skip to 1:00


To see my final rep max skip to 2:52


Last month, I decided to wanted to start seriously training pull ups again. I hadn’t trained pull ups in a while so I figured now would be the time to do it. After looking around, I discovered the Russian Fighter Pull Up Program.


Here are some useful links if you are unfamiliar with the program:


https://www.strongfirst.com/the-fighter-pullup-program-revisited/


https://www.t-nation.com/training/tip-do-the-russian-fighter-pull-up-program


Its a 30 day program and the goal is to increase the number of pull ups you can do in a single set. Obviously, I had to test and see how many reps I could do before beginning the program. 


When I tested, I got 11 reps. 


Based on that, I set a target goal of increasing my rep count to at least 16 by the end of the program. I also set a reach goal of 20 reps.


Now according to the articles above, there is a 5RM program template and a 15RM program template. However, there is no 10RM program (or 11RM for that matter) so I ended up having to find a way to split the difference. It seemed like there were two ways to go about it: 


1) Just use the 5RM template and adjust it for 11RM 


or


2) Take the 5RM numbers and double it for a 10RM program (and then add 1 rep to everything for an 11RM program).


After asking around, it seemed like I could go either way, so I ended up going for the 1st option. Looking back, choosing the 2nd option would have gotten extremely tough near the end. 


Here is the rep scheme I ended up doing. Its basically the 5RM program adjusted for 11 reps:


**Day 1**     11, 10, 9, 8, 7


**Day 2**     11, 10, 9, 8, 8


**Day 3**     11, 10, 9, 9, 8


**Day 4**     11, 10, 10, 9, 8


**Day 5**     11, 11, 10, 9, 8


**Day 6**     Off


**Day 7**     12, 11, 10, 9, 8


**Day 8**     12, 11, 10, 9, 9


**Day 9**     12, 11, 10, 10, 9


**Day 10**    12, 11, 11, 10, 9


**Day 11**    12, 12, 11, 10, 9


**Day 12**    Off


**Day 13**    13, 12, 11, 10, 9


**Day 14**    13, 12, 11, 10, 10


**Day 15**    13, 12, 11, 11, 10


**Day 16**    13, 12, 12, 11, 10


**Day 17**    13, 13, 12, 11, 10


**Day 18**    Off


**Day 19**    14, 13, 12, 11, 10


**Day 20**    14, 13, 12, 11, 11


**Day 21**    14, 13, 12, 12, 11


**Day 22**    14, 13, 13, 12, 11


**Day 23**    14, 14, 13, 12, 11


**Day 24**    Off


**Day 25**    15, 14, 13, 12, 11


**Day 26**    15, 14, 13, 12, 12


**Day 27**    15, 14, 13, 13, 12


**Day 28**    15, 14, 14, 13, 12


**Day 29**    15, 15, 14, 13, 12


**Day 30**    Off


After the end of the 30 days, I took 2 days off and then retested my max. 


I ended up getting 17 reps! Higher than my target goal of 16, but not quite there at my reach of 20. 


Other important notes:


* I am a 26 year old male


* I was able to do the program exactly as written. 


* My starting stats were 183cm/6ft height and 77kg/170lbs weight. 


* I did not gain or lose weight throughout the program.


* I ate close to my maintenance everyday (around 2500 calories). 


* My macros generally were ~160g +/-10g of protein, ~150g +/-10g of carbs, the rest of my calories came from fat.

 
* I had 3 cheat days (pretty much pizza and cheesecake splurges) where I just ate whatever I wanted and didn’t track macros. However, I kept the calories around 2500.


* All meat and animal products I ate was organic and/or grass-fed.


* The program did not specify rest times, however the comments in the StrongFirst post recommended long rests. So I generally rested for at least 10 minutes between sets. I basically did the sets throughout the day. 


* I managed to get an average of 8 hours of sleep every night


* I did not do any other upper body pulling exercise for the duration of the program. 


Personally, I think 11 to 17 in 30 days is solid progress. I suppose if I were to do it again, I could’ve done a version where I took the 5RM and just doubled the reps. But something tells me that would be much harder as I don’t think I’d be able to hit all the reps since it goes up really fast. Overall, I had a great experience with this program and would highly recommend it. It's incredibly easy to incorporate into your current routine. Anyone else tried the Russian Fighter Pull Up program? Know any other Pull Up programs you like? Let me know!

3 years transforming my body with running,xxflumanxx,896,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jkfuji/3_years_transforming_my_body_with_running/,1603996689.0,"[https://imgur.com/a/w2kQM7q](https://imgur.com/a/w2kQM7q)

Today  is exactly 3 years from the day I started running. I couldn't do two  blocks because my chest hurt. Today I ran 20 km and returned home  without even perspiring or doing things as soon as I arrived, there is  literally no fatigue

But the  important thing is not just feeling good physically. Change your diet,  your habits, your way of thinking! Running became a lifestyle that I  only look back on and see beautiful memories, I love it, I feel like I  need it more every day, it's great! I don't even believe it when I see  my self from 3 years ago see it without doing anything, today in a month  I can run 400km and it feels incredible, the feeling that at least  nobody in a 4 km radius (in my case, I live in a small town) can run  like me and many other satisfactions is amazing

Please  be encouraged to try running, your life will be better in all aspects,  and much more when you put aside the search for a better body, because  believe me, that soon becomes totally secondary.

Postscript:  if you want to know why I started running, they invited me to play a  soccer game, I had such a bad time, everything hurt and the next day I  tried to run with a friend but it didn't last two blocks the next and I  went home and wanted to abandon everything.

The  next day with nothing to do I started to see rocky for the first time  without thinking about it, and nothing ended, I felt super motivated and  went running, I did 300 meters without stopping and returned to my  house, and well I was adding day by day and I'm here today, I didn't  stop

When did I start: Men (22) - 76kg - 166cm

Today 3 years later: Men (25) - 55kg- 166cm

I  know this is not an inspiring story and that I have read in this  subredt many best of all of you, but I felt happy and wanted to share my  achievement! Hope you have a beautiful week

The reason why I post this here is because now I started with calisthenics, to train with the recommended routine, I have been going for a month and it is my next goal and I am super excited! thanks for taking the time to read me

It took me about 1.15 hours to complete my entire workout in a gym. This was due to time wasted waiting for equipment to get free /wiping equipment and machines, benches/having forced conversations with people/prolonged rests etc. Ever since Ive shifted to doing my workouts at home I've kept the same exercise movements(Horizontal and vertical pushes and pulls, hip hinge, squat) and used a fitness app to limit my rest periods to just 1 minute max between sets.

To everyone doing a pushup/squat/plank/whatever challenge,161803398874989,886,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2t18hi/to_everyone_doing_a_pushupsquatplankwhatever/,1421743653.0,"So you've started exercising. That's great! You're a little inexperienced with fitness and chose one of these challenges as their starting point. As I am the mean mod, it falls to me to shit all over your dreams and to tell you everything wrong with these challenges.

First off, whatever challenge you may be doing, it involves endurance. Loads of it. Now endurance isn't a bad quality to develop, not at all. However, it's rather task specific. If you're going to do a pushup challenge, you'll get good at pushups, and not much else. If you're going to do a plank challenge, you'll get good at planking, and not much else. If you're going to do a squat challenge... I think you can guess how the pattern goes. You get good at the one thing you're doing, and the carryover to other movements is minimal. You're not getting stronger as much as you're getting good at doing that one thing. 

If you're looking to get into exercising, you typically have some kind of goals like ""look better naked"" or ""get stronger"". While these challenges might influence your body composition a little, there are much better ways to go about changing that. Likewise, developing endurance in a specific exercise is not very conducive to developing strength. Sure, if you start out not being able to do a pushup and then you build up to 50 pushups, you've gotten stronger. However, 4/5ths of that journey is time you could've spend on diamond pushups, which would've made you even stronger. If you could already do 10 pushups, there's not much value in doing pushups for strength development. 

There is a certain injury risk associated with this kind of challenge. It's not as pronounced with the squat and plank challenges, but the pushup challenge can really do a number on your shoulders, especially if your pushups look like the ones most people do. Not to mention the imbalance (pushups train the front side of your body, what are you doing for the back?) you can get from them.

I hope I have sufficiently crushed your dreams. Before you go cry in the corner, here are some alternatives to get you in the right direction (/u/Solfire keeps telling me I have a heart, maybe it's true after all). 

* Obviously, I recommend [the beginner routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine). It's designed to teach you the essential skills you need to succeed when doing bodyweight fitness.
* Some people have issues with commitment, need to exercise every day, or don't have more than 20 minute blocks free, or whatever. There's a nifty little thing called [Grease the Groove](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2fw35o/training_tuesday_post_your_routine/ckdlw1f). Basically, you do multiple (submaximal!) sets of the exercises you're working out throughout the day. You can even set yourself a goal like 50 pushups a day! The essential trick here, though, is to make the exercise harder once you get good at it. For instance, with squats you might move onto deep step-ups once you can do 15 good squats. With pushups you might move onto diamond pushups and then pseudo-planche pushups. Our [exercise wiki](/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/playground) (WIP) has some ideas on how to do this for a lot of different exercises. Make sure to work on at least one pulling exercise for each pushing exercise. Pick 2-3 exercises to start with, and try to ease yourself in. This is Grease the Groove, not bootcamp. If you're doing sets to failure 5 times a day, you're going to get burned out quickly.

Alright, so I've given you my ""recommended recommended alternative"" and my ""recommended alternative if you don't want to do the recommended recommended alternative"".

**Ramadan Mubarak! It's the time of the year where over a billion people start their month of daily fasting. In some countries this fast takes over 20 hours! Did we mention that you're also not supposed to drink water during that time? Yeah, it's pretty tough! This leads to a problem some of our Muslim friends face: HOW SHOULD I WORKOUT?!**

## Veteran

Don’t worry, in this article I’ll do my best to guide you through this Ramadan so that you can maintain or even enhance your training gains. As a Ramadan veteran who has successfully done multiple cutting and multiple bulking cycles, I do my best to teach you the ways!

## 1. Hydration

Starting off strong with hydration. Your primary goal during this month should be to stay hydrated. This is your most important goal, whether you are planning on working out or not. How do we do that? It’s rather simple:

1. By getting in plenty of water.
2. By preventing excessive water loss.

Let’s start by discussing the first point. What does plenty of water entail? To find out, [**use a water intake calculator like this one**](https://goodcalculators.com/water-intake-calculator/). The first thing you might notice is that you need quite a lot of water. For example, I weigh around 64 kg and need 3-4 liters of water per day.

I achieve getting that much water by making sure I drink about a liter each hour. Pro tip: It’s easier to drink water when having a meal. When you’re not eating, consider drinking something that is packed with electrolytes like coconut water. It’ll be much easier to get a good amount of water in that way. If you’re hardcore, get yourself an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and drink that. Be advised, it’s not the most delicious thing out there.

The second point is of equal importance. It’s extremely important to prevent excessive water loss. If there is a way to do something you want to do without sweating, do that! This probably means it’s a good idea to shorten or eliminate your cardio sessions. Your training environment is also of importance. You don’t want to be working out in the sun or in a gym without air-conditioning. Stay in the shades and find a climate controlled gym to prevent excessive sweating. Oh yeah, not sure if I should even mention this, but… like don’t go.. to the sauna okay?

## 2. Eat enough

Eating enough can mean different things depending on your goal. However, the general rule is: you should be eating an equivalent amount of food during Ramadan as when you’re not doing Ramadan. Nothing changes, you just have a shorter amount of time to get the food in.

**How to eat a lot**

If you’re planning on making mass gains during Ramadan, you’ll have to learn how to eat a lot in a short eating window. These are some tips to help you to achieve that.

1. Eat small meals frequently. A lot of people make the mistake of having a huge meal after they break their fast and stay full for the entirety of the eating window. They get 1000-1500 kcal in and stop eating for the rest of the eating window. This isn’t really effective if you’re trying to gain weight. Instead your meals should all be small and you should be eating every 45-60 minutes. Unfortunately not everyone has the privilege of staying awake throughout the entirety of the eating window. If that’s you, strongly consider not gaining mass but rather maintaining mass or follow the other tips.
2. Your last meal should be your biggest meal. In the previous tip we talked about having small meals frequently so that you’re able to get in more calories. However, your last meal can be a huge one, because you’re not going to have your next meal for a while. Just make sure to not vomit. It has happened to me and it’s quite possibly the worst thing that can happen during a mass cycle.
3. Eat foods that have a high calorie-volume ratio. Some foods are extremely low in calories even if you get kilograms in of them. Vegetables are good example of that. Try eating food that packed with calories like nuts. Junk food is also fine, just don’t overdo it and make sure you don’t miss out on your micro-nutrients and get too much sodium in.

**How to eat less**

Eating less is actually much easier for most of us during such a short eating window. Just do the opposite of what you should be doing to eat a lot.

1. Eat one or two meals only. Just calculate how much you need calorie wise and get that in having only one or two meals.
2. Eat foods that have a low calorie-volume ratio.
3. Drink protein shakes to feel full.

**Protein**

Make sure to not skip your protein shakes if you were taking them. Also strongly consider having around 25-50 grams of casein protein before sleeping. Casein is a slow-digesting protein that slowly releases amino acids. This means that you’ll have protein supply hours after you stopped eating!

## 3. Training goals

It’s easier to make more strength gains than mass gains when you have a short eating window, especially for bigger athletes. We strongly recommend you do to be doing a strength or skill cycle for this reason. Strength workouts are also shorter than hypertrophy workouts and require less hydration and nutrition.

This doesn’t mean you can’t do a mass cycle during Ramadan, it just requires more work. You’ll need to drink and eat more to able to benefit from it. If you think you’re capable of putting in the work without vomiting, then by all means go ahead. However, remember: the bigger you are, the harder it will be to do this. Be realistic and think carefully before deciding.

## 4. Workout timing

A question that I often get asked is: When should I do my workout? There is no clear answer to this. Research on intermittent fasting seems to suggest that timing doesn’t really matter. However, Ramadan is a bit different from a typical intermittent fasting diet. The windows are usually longer and hydration is a non-issue when doing intermittent fasting.

I personally prefer to have my workouts as close as possible before breaking the fast. I don’t feel like having to deal with being extra hungry and dehydrated for the entirety of the day. Instead, I’d like to workout and immediately break my fast and start eating and drinking.

Some people can’t do this. They feel too tired (which could be a sign of not eating and/or drinking enough) to have a workout when they’re deep in their fast. An option for them is to work out during the eating window. Have a small meal and do your workout an hour later. Some research seems to hint at a better power output when doing this compared to the first method. Nevertheless, there is a huge con with the second option: you’re sacrificing valuable time that could be spent on eating on working out. This might not matter if your goal is to lose mass. But if your goal is to maintain or gain mass, then it might not be the best idea.

## 5. Eat nutritious

Last but not least, eat nutritious. Our eating habits change completely during Ramadan. It’s very easy to have a small variation of food where you miss out on a lot of essential things like fiber and vitamins. The best way to prevent that is to eat as closely as possible as you usually would eat when not fasting. Supplements can definitely also help if you want to maintain a more flexible diet. The point of this paragraph is just to make you aware of that you’re making drastic changes in your diet and to be aware of that.

Hopefully this article was of use for you. I wish all of you good luck with your training and self-improvement during this month. Remember to enjoy it. Don’t forget why you’re doing it in the first place!

I'll do my best to answer any questions you guys have. Good luck!"

(~185 to 140lbs) M/28/5'5""- Strength training 2-3x a week with gentle cardio, tracking macros and generally focusing on form.",RossyRossy,881,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jifclq/nine_month_progress_update_185_to_140lbs_m2855/,1603721906.0,"Hi all,

I've been making regular progress updates, partly for my own morale but also hoping it helps others in similar situations. I've gone from zero workout experience in January, to now having logged over 100 (and counting) workout sessions this year! Hoping to reach 120 by Christmas.

During this period I've completely changed my diet, try to workout 2-3 a week and avoid unhealthy habits. My mental health has improved immensely and I'm still keen to keep mixing it up and seeing how I can work toward a higher level of strength and fitness.

As a bit of background I began dieting late 2019 but started strength training properly in Jan 2020.

**Current**

Oct '20 - 139lbs or 63kg ([Current](https://imgur.com/a/0P9GFwW))

I'm super super close to a point at which I want to switch from losing weight to adding mass. Any weight loss I do encounter happens very slowly (<1lb a week) and I'm not denying myself treats or larger meals, especially on workout days. My plan is to keep to my macros for another month and somewhere in late November/early December, switch to a higher caloric intake whilst keeping my exercise levels pretty much the same.

**Exercise Routine**

My routine was first influenced by the RR. I was looking for a home workout with minimal equipment, and that worked exactly as I hoped. I found that some of the exercises were just too hard - even progressions. I started with some exercises I could do - mainly so I could warm up and feel some improvement. Now I feel like I can take on a lot more. I eventually deviated from the RR but kept some components and the core principals behind it. Recently I've been utilising dumbbells more but still keeping bodyweight exercise a key component of my routines.

My current equipment consists of a pull-up bar and a pair of dumbbells. I use furniture around the house to assist, but being in the UK not many houses are particular well suited to hanging rings from the ceiling, etc, especially my one!

I always aim to do a routine every other day. On good weeks I can get 3-4 workouts done, but as long as I manage to squeeze in two sessions I see that as a win. I don't let it interfere with my personal life, but as I work from home I can quite often find an hour or two to fit it in. I also do a lot of dog walking to contribute with some gentle cardio, and I'm hoping to pick up cycling again in the new year.

I currently alternate between two exercise sets. Both full-body, but my second and most latest routine incorporates more of the obliques and some other muscle groups I felt were lacking.

Routine 1:

* Deep weighted squats (3 x 10)
* Hanging leg raises (3 x 6)
* Push-ups (3 x 14)
* Dips (3 x 14)
* Pull-ups (3 x 8)
* Wide Push-ups (3 x 14)
* Elbow Plank (3 x 45 secs)
* Reverse Superman Snow Angels (3 x 15)
* Tabletop Crunches (3 x 15)
* Leg Raises (3 x 14)
* Chin-ups (3 x 9)
* Diamond Push-ups (3 x 11)
* Dumbbell hammer curls (3 x 9) OR bicep curls (3 x 8)
* Dumbbell bench fly (3 x 11)

Routine 2:

* Hanging leg raises (3 x 6)
* Dumbbell Lunges (3 x 10)
* Weighted Crunches (3 x 15)
* Pull-ups (3 x 8)
* Push-ups (3 x 14)
* Dumbbell Swing (3 x 15)
* Dumbbell Woodchop (3 x 15)
* Chin-ups (3 x 9)
* Dumbbell Side Bends (3 x 15)
* Leg Raises (3 x 14)
* Dips (3 x 14)
* Dumbbell hammer curls (3 x 9) OR bicep curls (3 x 8)
* Dumbbell bench fly (3 x 11)

After tracking my workouts and seeing the progression I realise that I'm add one or two reps every month or so. I also try to up the weight gradually, and I'm starting to max out my current weight set.

I recommend the free app 'Strong' to track workouts I take around 30-45 second breaks between sets, and the routine takes around 1hr 15 min - 1hr 30 mins including a short warm-up and dependent on if I have to take a work call!

**Diet**

I've slowed my weight loss now, aiming to consume around my BMR each day (\~1800 cals) with an emphasis on high protein (upwards of 1g of protein for each lb of weight) and low fat. I track my macros quite thoroughly and try to ensure at least 30% of my cals come from protein and a higher emphasis toward carbs than fats. I'm trying to eat differently as much as I can, adding more and more veggies and salad where I can find them.

* Breakfast - porridge and milk, oats, etc.
* Lunch - Eggs, low fat sausages, high protein cheese, salad
* Dinner - Smoky bean chilli, curries, or other lean meat meals (usually beef, pork or chicken) with a smaller portion of carbs (pasta, small wraps, rice), many veggies (carrots, green beans, onion, mushrooms, butternut squash, peppers), salad
* Snacks - Greek/icelandic style yoghurt, almonds, bananas, protein shakes (1 a day with milk)

For those who are interested I use this [BMR Calculator](https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/).

I try to avoid chocolate, cakes, or other processed snacks. We cook from scratch for almost everything, which is great as I can completely control what goes in. We barely use any oil for cooking and our meals are still super tasty without the need for extra fats from oils or dressings.

**Plan moving forward**

I'm aiming to stick with the current plan for another month or so. I'd like to see how the current caloric intake affects my weight and physique, but the feeling I have is that it's easily repairable if I do end up dropping too much weight. I would, of course, like to see more definition but I appreciate with my leftover fat and loose skin from my heavier days this might be wishful thinking! I'm enjoying feeling healthier and stronger, however, so eventually I will build on that. I don't feel like I've plateaued yet, or weakened in any way.

I'm really happy with the progress so far and I hope that it inspires or influences others to do the same! Comments from the wife, friends and family all really help build confidence, and I'm glad that I've done it now whilst I'm still young to keep a good habit moving forward. Sort of wish I started it earlier but I try not to worry about the past. Looking forward to seeing how it goes!

I'd be particularly interested for tips regarding the transition from dieting to upping my intake - whether I need to mix up my routine or change the way I do things. I feel like my habits are mostly okay, probably never perfect but for someone who has barely even set foot in a gym things are moving along smoothly.

Many thanks for everyone on the sub, I've had a lot of ideas and suggestions from people and it's excellent reading. Advice for newbies really helped me get off the ground and I feel far more confident in my own choices as well as advising others now."
Grease the Groove is truly a miracle,BurnItDownSR,884,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9zrpga/grease_the_groove_is_truly_a_miracle/,1543004557.0,"If you're unfamiliar, Grease the Groove is a training technique that Pavel Tsatsouline is largely credited for. The way he explains it, if you want to build strength or add reps to an exercise you need to do that exercise often but stay far away from failure or fatigue so for example if you can do an exercise for a max of 10 reps Pavel recommends only doing 5 reps *or less* and have at least 15 minutes of rest between sets but the rest between sets can really be as long as you want it to be. You can even take a nap then an hour after the nap do the next set or do one set before you leave the house in morning and do the next one when you get home from work. He also doesn't seem too bothered about how many sets you should do. 

Man, I used to think this was too good to be true.

He made it sound like, ""Yeah all you need to do is bang out a few easy reps here and there and you're gonna get stronger.""

And I was like, ""There must be more to this."" So I thought maybe it was the volume you accumulate throughout your day that caused improvements so what I did was make sure I always did at least 10 sets and also made sure that for example if I set my reps to 5, I'd always hit 5 reps in every set no matter what. Also, because its hard to remember to do 10 sets throughout your day I set an interval timer for 30 minutes each as soon as I got home so that every 30 minutes I'd be reminded to do another set. I thought if 15 minutes was the minimum time to rest then surely I'll get better results with twice that much rest. 

But what happened? I started getting aches and pains in my muscles and joints. These didn't feel like soreness, they felt like I had needles stuck inside my muscles and I actually got weaker and weaker because the more I went on, the more I had to struggle to hit every rep in every set that I did. 

I initially tried Grease the Groove to add numbers to my chin ups which were lagging while I did my regular workouts too but I ended up being too fatigued and was eventually forced to choose between doing my regular workouts and greasing the groove so I decided to say ""fuck it"" and just do it exactly the way Pavel describes it.

I then took a week off of all exercise and decided when I went back to greasing the groove I wouldn't count sets and I would go by feel on how many reps to do. If I had a pre-set number of reps like 5 then I just made that maximum number of reps per set and didn't allow myself to go beyond that but anything below that was fine, even 1 rep. And so I did chin ups literally whenever I felt like it, there was no timer anymore and I wasn't really counting sets. Sometimes I'd do 2 reps, sometimes one, sometimes 5 but I just went with what felt comfortable. I tried to be as lazy as possible (except of course I tried to maintain perfect form when I was doing the few reps that I did) and if there was even the slightest hesitation in me to do a set, I would just not do one.

My guess is that most days I only did 10 total reps.

What happened when I did it that way? I actually got stronger and stronger. My actual progression was doing a max of 3 reps per set then 4 then 5 then weighted chin ups (because Pavel says when greasing the groove with 5 reps is a walk in the park you should move on to adding external resistance) and that progression happened all within a month. Today I can do 30 strict bodyweight chin ups. When I was doing the 10 sets with the timer and being strict about doing every single rep I never progressed to doing 4 or 5 let alone using weights.  

I was also doing a Dorian Yates style body building workout once a week and HIIT 2x a week both when I was doing ""strict"" Grease the Groove and now when doing a chill Grease the Groove. With the first one I felt like shit, I'd often feel like I was bordering on getting a fever but with the second one, I always feel fresh and never felt the need to take a break. In fact, a lot of times I felt just as fresh as when I took a week off. 

Turns out Pavel was being serious when he said to just do a few reps here and there. 

That was a little over one year ago. Grease the Groove done properly was actually what inspired me to do more Calisthenics work and I'm proud to say that today I can do a 1 arm pushup with shoulders square and feet shoulder width apart, strict ring & bar muscle ups, ring & bar front levers, and a human flag and I never felt like I was exercising or working out when I developed those movements, I only felt like I was '*practicing*'. In reality it probably wasn't easy for me to develop all those movements because it took quite a bit of time and I had to go through a lot of easier variations before I could do the actual move but it sure as hell felt easy because not once did I ever need motivation to practice the movements, I never had to contend with my willpower, in fact when I was feeling lazy I just allowed the urge to slack off to win. I never slacked off whenever I did practice those movements though because if I felt that there was a 1% chance that I'd do a lazy rep or if while I'm doing one rep I think the next rep would be a half-ass one, I just cut the set short and move on with my day.

With ring movements I don't think I've taken a single day off for more than a year now because I bring my rings with me anytime I travel and still, I always feel fresh as a daisy. 

I'm truly amazed by this simple technique. I used to be very intimidated by the calisthenics movements that I can do now, thinking I'd have to go through hell and back to achieve them but today I'm just excited for the next new movement I can play with! And Grease the Groove truly feels like I'm just playing at this point. "
Critique: Most beginner routines designed by experts are actually intermediate routines,LifeCanBeGoody,883,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/13eeghi/critique_most_beginner_routines_designed_by/,1683784462.0,"Had it been the 90s, then it would have made sense that a beginner would have the stamina/endurance to perform the routines that most experts design to be for beginners. They are infact for intermediates who possess a minimum endurance. 

The most likely reason behind this is that most experts (in any field) forget what it is like to be a out of breath beginner. That's why not every expert in a field is a good (let alone great) teacher of that subject. Simply because they forgot what being a beginner feels like. 

They design very optimised balanced routines. But they forget that optimisation is of no use to a beginner if they can't complete the routine and look forward to the next day of the routine.  

The most important thing to remember is that beginners of today's age are mostly out of breath people (overweight or underweight). They don't even walk for short distances. So the main goal of a routine should be to make them do something in their endurance range. No need for a list of super balanced routine. Give them a push, a pull and a lower body movement. Example: Pushups, Rows and Squats. Make them do it 3 times a week without being **purposefully** sore. 

Another thing, make them start at a level that is easier than their current ability. I like this advice from the [startbodyweight.com](https://startbodyweight.com) routine where it says if you can do 4 pushups at a current level start at a progression below that level and then progress.

As for the routines of the sub, I think, the RR is not absolutely a beginner routine. Even the BWF Primer is not a beginner routine. Although it has a gradual buildup, it makes you exercise everyday. It may be suitable for many but not for most absolute beginners who have never worked out before or is sedentary for a long long time. Also an absolute beginner don't need a seperate core workout. Those are for intermediates. 

Our goal as a community should be not to intimidate beginners but rather to make sure that they are exited to do the next workout because there was no pain in today's workout and almost no soreness after  waking up the next day.

This was my critique/rant. I may be entirely wrong. But I am open to changing my mind through discussion."
What is it about calisthenics that causes almost every body to look like a shredded Ninja warrior?,Chiefesoteric,882,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/wbcdog/what_is_it_about_calisthenics_that_causes_almost/,1659119942.0,"Over the past 2 years I've lost 70 lbs, and have started re-evaluating what my ideal body image is. I'm down to 23% bodyfat and I'd like to get down to 15% by next year. I'll be 43 years old next year for reference.

My (somewhat unrealistic) body-image-goal is to look like Gray Fox from Metal Gear Solid or Snake Eyes from the GI Joe. Both of these ninjas are svelte, slender, and have concealed strength.

After looking at what types of training causes people to have different types of bodies, I noticed that almost everyone who practices bodyweight training/calisthenics, has achieved the body that I want.

But here's my question: 

What is it about Calisthenics that causes the human body to develop such slender explosive muscles and keep the waist trim while also not creating a barrel chest?

Is there a development of slow and fast muscle fiber that keeps the muscles slender?

My apologies if this sounds like a strange and juvenile question, but I have a lot to learn."
"Is it safe to casually walk on a treadmill for 4+ hrs a day, every day?",KairraAlpha,883,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/vgs1qi/is_it_safe_to_casually_walk_on_a_treadmill_for_4/,1655749145.0,"OK, so let me explain. Please bear with the huge post but it's been a journey. 

For the last year something has happened to my stomach. I got really sick, couldn't eat, acid reflux like crazy, nausea, you name it. I was so sick i stopped eating almost entirely, I couldn't take in more than 500 calories a day, lost 2 stone in weight and was put through cancer detection which included endoscopy and 3 MRI scans, all of which came back clear. Roll on a year and I'm left with what docs presume is GERD but they say it's atypical and don't know what to do about it.

So this weekend we went to an event. Each day we were walking around 6-9 hrs a day, we sat only for meals and then walked again. Each day I had little to no acid reflux. I could go home to the hotel and sit or lie down and it wouldn't come back. I didn't have to take any stomach medication in this time. However today was the first day back home and I've walked only 1hr and had reflux all day. So i can only presume that I need to be far more active than is possible for me to be in my small home town, in order to help my digestive system filter the food in me. I have a 9 year old daughter, if I were alone I would spend all my time outdoors walking but I can't feasibly do that with her and I'm often alone as my husband works on delegations as part of his job so he's only here one week out of 4 most of the time. So my ability to walk for more than a couple of hours a day is fairly limited to whatever time she's at school and hey, in a week's time it's summer holidays. We don't drive so I can't just pack up and head to a nice place to walk and my town is...tiny and lacklustre to say the least. 

So here's what I'm asking - I want to get a treadmill in the house and just casually walk on it every day. I want to be able to walk on it at least 4 hours a day, most days. Is this safe? I'm not obese, my bmi is 28 I think so I have a little weight on me but I'm fit enough that walking for 9 hrs barely bothered me. I don't smoke and my diet is healthy now, I'm back to eating around 1800 to 2k calories a day depending on my exercise level.
Bear in mind, I'm not walking for fitness, just for the sake of my stomach. Is it OK to be on a treadmill for hours every day at a low pace? I was also thinking of getting the slim foldable one so I could put it under my desk when I want to game as atm I can't sit in my pc chair at all without getting reflux and I miss gaming so much. However, this would raise the amount of time i am walking or standing per day too.

What do you guys think? Is it safe to do this? I can't think of anything else I can do to help my stomach."

As stated in the title, I wrote a research based diet guide that discusses general macronutrient intake quantities and the roles that fats, carbohydrates, and protein play in exercise performance. The guide also dives into macronutrient manipulation specifically for fat loss and muscle growth and looks at how alcohol can hinder fitness progress.

My 30 day quarantine transformation,Jameeeeeeeee,879,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n50lz6/my_30_day_quarantine_transformation/,1620168436.0,"Hey guys! Been a lurker here for a while and I was inspired by some of your stories so I thought I'd share mine.⁣⁣
⁣⁣




I've struggled for a VERY long time to get rid of that extra layer of belly fat. For a long time, I thought it might be genetic, but I think I finally figured it out.⁣⁣
⁣



[Here's the transformation pic](https://ibb.co/348rgwm)
⁣



Picture 1: About 3 months into lockdown. I had just started a soul-crushing office job which left me no energy and little motivation to focus on my own fitness. That, combined with the fact that all gyms were shut down meant I spent most of my time on my butt sitting down in front of the computer, with an activity level resembling that of a baked potato.⁣⁣
⁣⁣

I had lost a lot of muscle mass and put on a little more fat than I liked. I was regressing back into the dreaded ""skinny-fat"" zone.⁣⁣
⁣⁣

I felt lethargic, low energy, and generally unpleasant every day. It reflecting in ALL the things that I did, the way I interacted with my family, my friends, and my co-workers. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣

I began my little self-experiment and challenged myself to see how much I could change in a month.⁣⁣
⁣⁣

Picture 2: Exactly 1 month later. I experimented with ways to work out without the gym. I started doing calisthenics, using my own body weight as the main training mechanism. I focused on keeping my protein intake high and doing BW resistance training. I did a push pull leg split, with an extra day to work on my front and back levers.⁣
I managed to put on 7 pounds of lean muscle and my abs came back.⁣⁣
⁣⁣

Currently I'm taking a break from training due to a recent shoulder surgery, but I'm looking forward to getting back to it once it heals up 🙂!⁣⁣
⁣⁣

One thing that really helped during this period was starting off gradually,  starting with working out three times a week before ramping up to 4 times a week so that my body could adjust to the new training stimulus. ⁣
⁣⁣

Tracking my calories and macros on MFP was also extremely helpful, especially protein because I wanted to keep my muscle mass high.⁣⁣
⁣⁣

Just wanted to share my story. Hope you guys found it helpful! 🙂"
Build your own calisthenics gym (recommendations and tips),vth0mas,875,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gwloif/build_your_own_calisthenics_gym_recommendations/,1591290937.0,"Hey BWF,

Due to quarantine a lot of people have been building their own calisthenics gym, and I've [joined the trend.](https://imgur.com/a/r91oSJy) If you want a basic rundown on how to build this design, check out [this guide](https://youtu.be/29ESce1kqRc) and show some love to the creator (not me). Mine is modified in ways I describe below. That being said, this isn't a build guide, but a recommendation for certain design specifications that'll help you get the most out of your gym, what I learned in building it, and what I did right/imperfectly to help you construct yours the best you can.

I work as a construction/painting/deep cleaning handyman, so I brought my professional experience to this project and hope it provides you insight.

**Recommendations**

* Stall bars being perpendicular to dip bars. This simple design choice opens up amazing possibilities. Using the stall bars to support your feet, you can perform pike pushups on the dip bars with your feet at various levels. You can also support your feet on the stall bars and do regular pushups on the dip bars. This affords advantages over regular pushups: 1) your wrist position is healthier in neutral grip 2) you can go deeper than other pushup variations to activate pectoral muscles (be sure not to go too far and overextend your deltoids) 3) there is enough clearance between you in the ground to do weighted pushups with a dip belt.
* Five foot pull up bars. Long pull up bars give you enough room for wide pull-ups, or archer pull ups, which take the most space. By having wide bars it offsets the safety risk of having concrete feet around your posts (a negative I'll go into later).
* Dip bars 20"" apart. This may very well change depending on your shoulder width, but a good average distance between dip bars is 20"" for shoulder health. Common recommendations are between 18"" and 22"". Measure your shoulders and customize it to your needs! Don't just do what someone else tells you. This will effect the distance of your stall bar posts in this design, so make that calculation first!
* Low pulp bar. Not low enough for Australian pull-ups, which you should do on the dip bars, but low enough that you can jump on top of the bar and do a negative muscle up. This also allows you to do an assisted pistol squat to assisted muscle up, a huge benefit when transitioning into more difficult movements.
* Stall bars protruding from the post on one side, with rubber caps. Having your stall bars slightly longer than they need to be gives you grips at various heights. This allows for inclined one armed pushups, and handy places to grab and perform stretches, dragon flags, etc. Doing this makes sizing the dip bars easier as well, because the length of your stall bars doesn't need to be perfect in order to space your dip bars according to your personal preferences/shoulder width.
* Dip bars supported on one side by 90 degree angle joints, not posts. This allows for freedom of movement and paralette work. You don't want to come down from a planche too fast and strike your body on the edge of a fence post. You don't want to have to clear the corners of a post when doing a retracting your legs from a wide leg movement. Having the outside edges be galvanized steel pipe joints is safer, and it is cheaper than posts, mainly due to the fact that you don't have to use as much concrete to set them (more on that later).
* Dip bars require less concrete to stabilize. The width of your post hole, and therefor the amount of concrete you need to set the post, is based on the width of the pole you are trying to set. By having one side of your dip bars supported by steel pipe, not only do you get the benefits previously listed, but your post holes don't have to be as deep or wide. Save yourself the work, money and safety concerns by making one side of your dip bars supported by steel rather than wood.
* Bars supported by pipe flanges/wood screws on one side, supported simply by sitting in a bored out hole in the post on the other. Your bars don't need to be fastened down on both sides. They only need to be attached to one post and sit *inside* the opposite post. This saves you money on flanges, which ran me $13 a piece, saves you on the effort of installation, and allows you to easily level the bars by seating them in the hole, then only having to manipulate one side. Also, definitely go with coated wood screws over bolts! Bolts are expensive, require washers and nuts, and unnecessarily protrude from one end of the post, creating a hazard. Four 3"" in wood screws is more than strong enough, and remember: the other side is sitting inside the post itself, which is stronger than any fastener and keeps the bar from moving at all (except for the bar flexing under weight, which is minimal for a galvanized steel pipe).
* Hook screws to hang rings/dip belt. This is minor preference, but a very good idea if you live in a windy area. By putting round, rubberized hooks up (safely away from where you'll be working) you can hang your rings on them, that way the wind won't thrash them around, making unnecessary noise and causing dings in your posts or splinters in wood rings.
* Stain your posts. For $10 you can protect your structure and make it look beautiful with wood stain. Don't stick pieces of construction equipment in the ground and call it good. Stain or paint your posts before installing them! To avoid running textures while staining, have a few painter's cloths handy and wipe excess stains *from end to end of the post.* It's imperative when doing this that you start on one end of the post and draw the cloth all the way to the other side for a nice blended texture. This extra hour or less of work will make your gym look great! Also, be sure to paint your bars with an oil based paint. This will also only cost you about $15, and if you're following the recommendation of only attaching the posts with flanges on one side you are saving a ton of money. An oil based paint will survive the weather, stick to metal, and reduce heat absorption from the sun. Mine are black and I live in the tropics; it's still better than bare steel. If you have neighbors or cool landlords they will really appreciate it, you can make your gym your own. Calisthenics isn't just utilitarian; there's an element of personal style and aesthetics to it, so bring that to your gym.
* Use supports while the concrete sets. Don't just level your post and leave it! As the concrete dries the post will shift unless you support it. Use other pieces of wood and clamps if you have them to make 45 degree angle supports while your concrete sets for at least 24 hours, but waiting 2-3 days is recommended.
* You don't have to mix the concrete before putting it in the post hole. Having to mix the concrete first is a common misconception. You can fill the hole with around 6 inches of concrete, spray it with the hose, repeat. It's far less messy, and mixing concrete is work you just don't have to do. In rainy areas people putting up a fence can literally just fill the holes with concrete, support the posts and let the rain do the job. Don't premix your concrete.
* Drill extra wood screws into the base of your posts so they can grip the concrete. Take four of those coated wood screws you're using to attach your bars, drill them into the posts about halfway between the base and the surface, facing upward at a 45 degree angle. This allows the posts to grip the concrete similar to a rebar structure. It's incredibly cheap in the grand scheme of the project and will make your posts that much more stable.
* Bury your posts *at least* 1/4 of the way into the ground. The sturdiest post is at least 1/3 of it's length into the ground, but that's for building a fence that needs to withstand wind force. You're just a person, and your force is mainly driving the posts down, not to the side, so you can get away with burying a 10"" pole 2.5"" ft into the ground. This will save you on buying longer polls and allow you to have your bars off the ground so that you can dead hang and not touch the ground.
* Put a few inches of concrete below the post before setting it. This seals in the bottom of the post and prevents wood rot. It'll increase the longevity of the structure, and concrete is cheap. You will have to dig a few inches deeper, which is the most laborious part of the job, but it's worth it.
* Build away from septic tanks/buried cables! I didn't learn this through trial and error, but I can force someone making this mistake. Make sure it's ok to dig down 2-3 feet in the area you want to build your gym.
* Have your department store cut your posts and thread your pipes. First several cuts are generally free, after that it's $0.25 each. No more than $3 to avoid all that work.

**Things I would do differently**

Fortunately this is a short list, but there are a few things I'd have done slightly differently, so don't make these mistakes!

* Paint any bars that will be sliding through a hole after you install them. I only did this with a few stall bars, but don't paint your bar first and then scratch it off the paint by sliding it through the bored hole it will be sitting in. Definitely paint all your flanges, dip bars and pull up bars first, but in this design you should put the stall bars up before painting them. Or, you could paint them first, accept that they'll get scratched, and just touch it up when you go to do the second coat of pain (which you should be doing anyway).
* Concrete feet? They're pretty, but they are a safety hazard. Having differing ground elevations and sharp edges is not ideal, especially if you have children who want to play on the gym. Given that my pull up bars are so wide and there are no small children in my house, it's perfectly safe, but it still takes a few extra bags of concrete. The posts are sturdier, but I think that's negligible, while buying a footing tube costs about $10 and takes extra work. I'd recommend going without the feet.
* Buy more concrete than you think you need. I've set concrete before, but you can always return what you don't use, and I ended up using more. This was due to the concrete feet and the decision to put a few inches below the posts as well, which I didn't factor into my initial design. Concrete is pretty cheap, so just stock up and return what you don't use rather than making multiple trips.

**Conclusion**

Building your own calisthenics gym is fun and incredibly rewarding. Once you have it up you'll never have to pay for a gym membership, spend time and gas money going to where you want to exercise, can train any time without interruption or sharing equipment, and will have far more options afforded to you. I save about 3 hours a week, or 12 hours a month (that's 1.5 work days!), by working out at home rather than getting ready, stopping for gas, and traveling to my nearest gym. I save about 15$ a week, or $60 a month, by not burning gas in traffic. I save $25-$50 a month on not having a gym membership (depending on what gym I chose to go to). This project will pay for itself in four months. I can't recommend this highly enough; if you can build your own gym, do it.

If you have any questions I'm more than happy to answer them!

Be safe, be healthy."

How to improve your ankle mobility effectively - identify the issue and solve it with three exercises and the explanation behind them,berimbolosforsatan,877,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/t2hsd2/how_to_improve_your_ankle_mobility_effectively/,1645942930.0,"
tl;dr: https://youtu.be/id_rTdAVbS8

Poor ankle mobility  can be the cause of a whole bunch of lower extremity injuries. As well as that, it can severely limit our ability to perform lower body exercises and even affect daily tasks such as walking.

If we don't have enough ankle mobility, it is a fast track to poor technique and pain.

Poor ankle mobility commonly manifests in the squat and we'll use that as our example: As I get deeper into the squat I need more and more ankle mobility - my knee has to travel forward -  but if I reach the end of my range of motion  and continue do go deeper into the squat, I am going to either fall backwards, or lose the positioning of these mm squat and put myself at risk for injury.

The name of the movement here is dorsiflexion. Dorsiflexion is the movement of pulling your toes towards your shin. 

Today's write up is about how to improve your dorsiflexion. Using a few anatomical principles, we can develop a tailored solution that will improve our mobility and prevent our ankles holding us back in our pursuits in and out of the gym!

#Test

Firstly, we have to test our ankle range of motion to identify what the cause of our lack of mobility is.

You may have seen this before, but what we are going to do is use our phone and place it against the wall - the average smartphone height is around 5 to 6 inches so it's perfect to use for this test. Place your toes against your phone and that will be our starting point, move your phone so you don't crush it and drive your knee forward and try to touch the wall without your knee collapsing inward, or your heel coming off the ground. If you can reach the wall no problem, then its a sign that your ankle mobility is decent. If you can't touch the wall, there is usually one of two things stopping you:

The first is a pulling sensation at the back of the calf, which just feels like a muscle is being stretched. This is simply calf muscle tightness and is a simple fix.

 Your calf is comprised of the gastrocnemius and soleus, which make up the triceps surae. One important difference between the two is that gastrocnemius and bi-articulate, which is a fancy way of saying it crosses two joints: the knee and the ankle. The soleus however only crosses the ankle. This is important because the muscle we need to focus on is the soleus - Because the soleus only crosses the ankle, that means to stretch it effectively, we need to make sure our knee is bent when doing so. If we wanted to stretch gastrocnemius, we would have the knee straight, as it needs to be stretch at two joints instead of one. We will keep this in mind later.

The second is what feels like a obstruction at the front of the ankle. It almost feels as if you're running into something. This is due to poor movement patterns of the bones that make up your ankle and no amount of stretching your calves will solve this problem. To find out what is going on, we need to have a look at the anatomy of the ankle. 

You have quite a few bones in the foot and ankle region but the ones we want to focus on make up the talocrural or ankle joint and they are the lower parts of the tibia, fibula and a bone in your foot called the talus. The tibia and fibula make a space in which the talus sits and sometimes there is a lack of space which can lead to mobility problems. 
In a properly functioning ankle, when we dorsiflex the foot,  the talus has to slide posteriorly to accommodate this movement. If the talus does not slide back, then your tibia, or shin bone, is just going to ram into your talus, and that is the thing that causes the obstruction.  So to fix this issue we need to in effect retrain the movement of dorsiflexion until we get the mechanics we are after.

I will show you three exercises that we can do to address both of these issues to improve your dorsiflexion quickly and permanently. 



#The program
##banded dorsiflexion
This one will help us retrain the movement of dorsiflexion so that our talus does its job of sliding out of the way when we need it to. To do this we will need a band attached behind and slightly below us and we are going to place it over the talus. A very common mistake is having the band too high. We do not want the band on our shin because this is actually pulling your shin bone backwards, which is the opposite of what we want to do. You want the band right at the hinge of your ankle joint, if you are unsure, have a look at the diagram of the ankle joint and place the band over the talus. See the video if you are unsure still about placement. From here we are going to drive our knee forwards and back, making sure to keep our foot flat on the floor the entire time and our knee isn't caving inwards, if you do either of those things, you won't get any benefits from this drill. 2 minutes back and forth continuously each side.

##soleus calf raises
To perform this one, get into the lunge position and place a kettlebell or some kind of reasonably heavy weight on top of your knee. Drive your knee forwards in the direction of your big toe, once you reach as far as you can with your heel on the ground, raise your heel as high as you can and contract your calf muscle. Three sets of 15 with a pause in the contraction.

##broomstick lunges
This one is all about making sure the talus tracks correctly when you dorsiflex the foot. Sometimes what happens is that the ankle joint just isn't tracking in a straight line, usually by collapsing the ankle and knee inwards. Place a broomstick end right next to your little toe, and drive your knee forwards, but on the other side of the broomstick. So at the end of the movement your foot should be on one side of the broomstick, and your knee the other. Like the first drill, make sure that your heel stays in contact with the ground at all times throughout. Two minutes back and forth in total on each side.

The program:
Banded dorsiflexion: 2 mins each side
Soleus Calf raise: 2 sets of 15 with a pause in the contraction each side
Broomstick lunges: 2 mins each side

There you go, three simple and incredibly effective drills to increase your ankle mobility!

"I made an app to create, manage, share, and log workouts",MaxdOut,871,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/oxkz1z/i_made_an_app_to_create_manage_share_and_log/,1628051440.0,"Hello everyone!

I've been training with a mix of calisthenics and weight lifting for a few years. Started off with the recommended routine, then experimented with my own schedules, weird exercises, all sorts of things.

The whole time I've tried to track my workouts. First with a printed sheet, then various apps, and finally my own excel sheet. It worked but the experience was never great, I couldn't find the right mix of usability and flexibility.

In the end I decided to develop the app I wish I had: Mylo

The goal was to simplify the hassle around managing workouts and to ensure you're always training with a plan.

Compared to logging apps where you write down what you just did, I wanted to start from the other end. Create (or find) your workout plan, describe how it's supposed to progress, and let the app handle the rest while still letting you log whatever you might need as you train.

**You can try Mylo as a web app** [**here**](https://www.mylo.fit?utm_source=reddit+bwf&utm_medium=Referral)**!**

Current features:

* flexible workout creation
* custom exercises (based on  reps, distance, or time)
* exercise rules so that reps/weights/rest/sets can update automatically
* simply and quickly share entire workouts
* great design and experience
* single reliable place to find workout plans (coming next)
* 100% free to use, no ads

I even recreated the Recommended Routine with it check it out: [Mylo - Recommended Routine](https://app.mylo.fit/s/workout/r-bwf-recommended-routine-Fm4ZOG1m?utm_source=reddit+bwf&utm_medium=Referral)

It's set up with the first exercises in each progression and with all the progression rules so reps will automatically update as you workout, this way it's super simple for beginners (555 -> 655 -> 665 -> 666 ...)

Of course you can still edit the schedule, exercises, rest, anything you want!

&#x200B;

There are still so many features I'm planning to add

* Android app (iOS would come later) \[[It's now out!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fit.mylo.app.twa)\]
* training history
* exercise skill trees
* more advanced rules
* graphical stat tracking (goals, metrics)
* social features
* and even more, I've got a whole roadmap!

Eventually it should support creating all the workouts from the wiki and more.

I would really appreciate your feedback! It will help prioritize development and turn Mylo into the app that can support your training.

&#x200B;

*I hope posting this is okay. I saw another post also talking about an exercise app. I'm a software dev who wanted to solve his own problem and share the solution I made with others. I really want it to become something that can help people with their training. It's 100% free to use and I'm going to keep updating it regardless for my own workouts and to keep improving.*

&#x200B;

Edit:

# Thank you all so much!

You have all been so freaking kind and your response has been absolutely incredible!!

I mainly made Mylo for my own workouts and to improve as a developer, I truly never imagined so many people would resonate with the idea. I really can't say this enough, thank you.

This is my first time making something public so I want development to be transparent and well communicated with those who are interested to hear more (ie no spamming).

I'm still figuring out the best way to go about this (ideas welcome) but for now I've taken your feedback and here are the planned next steps:

|Major Updates|Minor Updates|
|:-|:-|
|Android app (goal is by the end of August 2021) \[[It's out!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fit.mylo.app.twa)\]|Switch Metric and Imperial units \[released\]|
|Flexible Schedules (longer than 7 days)|Countdown timer (for time based exercises)\[released\]|
|Workout history / logging|Reuse routines across (and within) workouts|
|Exercise Skill Tree|Reorder exercises \[released\]|

*Note: These are in rough order of priority and might not represent the order they're released in.*

Edit 2:

I created a public Notion page with a more complete roadmap that I will keep up to date. You can also leave comments there :D

How I Learned to Handstand in 1 Month - 0-20 Seconds,Uninformed1diot,875,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aubd4t/how_i_learned_to_handstand_in_1_month_020_seconds/,1551035785.0,"In January of this year I was completely unable to hold a handstand. It is now February and I can quite consistently hold a 15-20 second handstand, occasionally even breaking 30 seconds.Here's how I did it:

&#x200B;

Firstly, if you want to watch a video of my personal progress (which you don't need to feel any obligation to do), it is [here](https://youtu.be/4eg37tEEgL4). I'm quite pleased with how it turned out but sorry if this counts as advertising.

&#x200B;

**Anyway, Step 1: Warm up**

&#x200B;

I didn't do this when I started to learn, and as a result, my wrists never felt too good after practising my handstands. I just assumed this was normal until I learned a few very important warm up stretches. The first of these is for the wrists. Get into a knee press up position with your hands pointing out in front of you. Now rotate your elbows so that the inside of your elbow is facing away from your body. Now, with straight arms, rock forward and backward about 5-10 times, holding the last rep in the forward position for about 10 seconds. Now repeat this with the different hand positions of having the back of your hand (and top of the wrist) on the floor and your hands pointing towards your body, with the stretch occuring when you lean back this time.

&#x200B;

You can also stretch out the shoulders by trying to ""touch the sky"" while keeping your back as straight as possible. You can also hold a resistance band, and while keeping straight arms, move your hands (and the band) from in front of your body, to over your head to behind your body. I love this stretch particularly because it can be very easy or very hard depending on how far apart your hands are when you hold the band.

&#x200B;

The most basic levels of mobility needed to hold a handstand is the ability to bend your wrists back so it makes a right angle with your forearm and to be able lift your arms up parallel to one another such that they are about 10 degrees from the vertical (although ideally completely vertical). If you don't have this mobility, doing these stretches as often as you can should get you to that level reasonably quickly.

&#x200B;

 **Now for the fun bit: Actually doing the handstand**

&#x200B;

More important than any tip of strategy or balancing tip I can give you is just to practise. Practise 5-6 times a week for a short amount of time (only 10-20 minutes each day is necessary). You shouldn't be too tired after each session as we are learning a skill rather than building up any real strength. I personally didn't have any schedule for my handstand practise, I just practised every day that my wrists felt ok to do so. If it is possible, clear out an area of floor to be your ""handstand zone"". This will make starting your session each day much easier, as you won't be put off by the fact that you'll have to move loads of stuff out of the way beforehand.It is important that you listen to your body in this process. If you feel any wrist pain at all, take the day off and stop practising until they feel better. While it is important to practise often for fast progress, what's more important is that you don't injure yourself, as to do so would be counter productive.

&#x200B;

**The Learning Process**

&#x200B;

While typical advice for hand balancing seems to follow the same structure of starting against a wall and slowly moving away from it until you no longer need to rely on it, I didn't do this at all. Is it a better and faster way to progress than just trying free standing handstands? Maybe, I don't know. There's just one small problem I have with learning against the wall and doing drills.

&#x200B;

It's incredibly boring.

&#x200B;

I'm not saying that you shouldn't use these drills. Far from it. I am just saying that it will be much easier to keep your motivation and continue to  practise consistently if that practise is something you find to be inherently enjoyable, as I did with falling over hundreds of times each day. I didn't really have any fear of falling backwards when attempting handstands, however, so if you do have this fear, I suppose I would recommend wall work. You'll just have to look at another post if you want any helpful advice on it, as I don't really know much about it. The main point to me saying this is simply that you can learn to handstand just by trying free standing handstands, and the more important thing is that you are able to maintain your training.

&#x200B;

**Tips for Kicking Up**

&#x200B;

This was actually the hardest part for me in my journey. Reaching a single 15 second handstand was actually much easier for me than consistently kicking up correctly. However, I did manage it through doing these things:

&#x200B;

1. Place your hands on the ground roughly shoulder width apart (perhaps very slightly wider) rather than how I started which was about double my shoulder width. This is a much less tiring position than the wide grip, and actually makes it easier to apply pressure with the hands when holding the position.
2. Make sure that your arms are straight and perpendicular to the ground when you kick up. This is how you want your arms to be when in the position, so you will have more success this way, as it is much easier to hold them in the same position when kicking up than it is to move them into the correct position during the kick up.
3. When kicking up, think about how your body should be aligned. Ideally the shoulders, hips and toes will all be in a straight line above the wrists. I always found that, if, on some day I was unable to kick into the position, just to think about consciously lining up my hips directly above my shoulders helped a lot.
4. Kick up with one foot, not two. I'm not entirely sure why this is easier, it just is. My guess is that it is simply because you are lifting less weight directly off the ground if one foot is in the air already.
5. Don't wear socks. Those of you that are trying to kick up with socks on, take them off and never look back.

&#x200B;

**Tips for Holding the Position**

&#x200B;

Holding a handstand is not simply staying in a position, but making a series of micro-adjustments based on whether you are too far forward or too far backwards at the current time. The hard part is learning the magnitude of these adjustments.

1. Try to ""crimp"" the ground. What I mean by this is that there should be three main points of contact between your hands and the ground: The ""heel"" of your hand (bottom of the palm), the top of the palm and the fingertips. I find it works best to have a very slight bridge between the top of the palm and the fingertips, making sure that the middle of each finger is either off the ground by about a millimetre, or touching the ground, but with less force than that at the fingertips. Also, try to spread out your fingers as much as possible. This all makes applying pressure through the fingertips much easier for when you are in danger of falling over backwards.
2. Make sure most of your weight is on the top of your palms. Most people (including myself) start by thinking that they should hold their weight on the ""heels"" of their hands. The problem with this, however, is that if you start falling forwards (in the direction your body is facing), you cannot apply pressure with any part of the hand and will inevitably fall that way. if you focus your weight on the ""middle"" of the hands, pressure may be applied with the fingertips to prevent falling backwards and with the ""heels"" to prevent falling backwards.
3. To improve body alignment and get rid of the banana handstand, there were a few cues that I used. The first is to try to push the body upwards with the shoulders, trying to make them level with your ears. The second is to keep the core tight, this causes you to naturally go into a more hollow bodied position. The third is to try to press your thighs together. i found this helped me to stop my feet from dangling in front of my head. It also makes sure that your legs stay together, leading to a more aesthetically pleasing handstand.

&#x200B;

I think that's everything I remember. Hope you found this helpful.

So I was the person with short arms who couldn't do a lsit,FitnessBoob,871,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4ox766/so_i_was_the_person_with_short_arms_who_couldnt/,1466400791.0,"Yeah so I'm an idiot. I posted a week ago that I couldn't reach the ground and my hands were quite high off the ground. 

Someone suggested sitting on a chair and if I could touch it I should be able to do the Lsit. Well I was but it got me buggered how I wasn't able to do one.

I was taking the photos to show peeps what I meant when my hubby got me to move a certain way. Turns out I have 0 strength in my shoulders and next to no flexibility.

To fix this I have started trying to do a sitting dip where I lift myself off the ground using my shoulders and L sits on books until I have enough strength and flexibility in my shoulders.

Posting this for anyone else who cannot reach the ground even when they feel like they have dropped their shoulders.

There is hope!"
OPINIONS- Wearing branded gym apparel as a larger person/before you reach goals.,lukahryan,870,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ii5pth/opinions_wearing_branded_gym_apparel_as_a_larger/,1598615845.0,"I’ve been working out for a while and eating better but recently had the privilege of paying a trainer to help me with a meal/workout plan. I’m still a bigger guy, starting out at 5’7”, 300lbs, 48% body fat. I’ve made some progress on my own but hopefully with the help of the plans I’ll pick up the pace a bit. 
Anyways-

I don’t have a ton of clothes as it is and I’d like to designate clothes specifically to wear at the gym so I’m not getting my regular casual clothes sweaty and dirty constantly. I’ve looked at Gymshark clothing a few times but can never bring myself to actually ORDER anything because I am still pretty big. Typically the only people I ever see wearing these brands already look amazing. I know everyone has to start somewhere but I get self conscious of myself. I know I personally wouldn’t think anything of it if I saw a larger person wearing Gymshark or bodybuilding or etc but I need to know how YOU feel

What are your thoughts on people wearing brands like Gymshark and Bodybuilding before they look like they go to the gym a lot?

TLDR: afraid to wear Gymshark appeal because I still look fat, need opinion-can fat people wear gym brands to gym"
Pull-ups and Science,nunped,868,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aeuscz/pullups_and_science/,1547208762.0,"# The science of Pull-ups

This is a compilation of results by scientific studies found by searching pubmed. For most part, I avoid describing the methods or weaknesses of the studies, focusing on the “Take Home” points for easy digestion. Feel free to ask for more details.

From this research, my main conclusion is that research focused on bodyweight fitness is lacking compared to weight exercises.


### The basics ([Ronai, 2014](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/2014/06000/The_Pull_up.14.aspx))
Pull-up is a multi-joint upper-body exercise (shoulder, scapulothoracic and elbow joints) that can improve an athlete’s shoulder girdle strength, stability, and ability to produce high forces during pulling activities. 

**Muscles involved:** middle trapezius, lower trapezius, rhomboids, pectoralis minor, pectoralis major, posterior deltoid, infraspinatus, latissimus dorsi, teres major, subscapularis, biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum superficialis, and flexor pollicis longus, external oblique, and erector spinae.


### Technique
A comparison of electromyographical activity [Snarr et al, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548150/) between normal pull-up, suspension pull-up and towel pull-up only showed **less activity of Mid-Trapezius on towel pull-ups** with no differences on other muscle groups. They conclude that **all variations are effective** exercises for the targeted muscles. 

[Youdas et al, 2010](https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=21068680) used Electromiography to compare muscular activity between pull-up,chin-up and the Perfect·Pullup^TM rotational device. Authors concluded that the **pectoralis major and biceps brachii had significantly higher EMG activation during the chin-up than during the pull-up**, whereas the lower trapezius was significantly more active during the pull-up. There was **no increased muscular recruitment using the Perfect·Pullup^TM** rotational device.


### Velocity vs Endurance
[Beckham et al, 2018](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2018/07000/Relationship_Between_Maximum_Pull_up_Repetitions.4.aspx) showed a **correlation between velocity of first pull-up repetition and maximum repetitions**. The authors suggest that determining the velocity of first pull-up could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of exercise testing batteries for military or police. [Thomas et al, 2018](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-9457(17\)30776-5) showed similar results.


### Comparison with Lat Pulldown
[Halet et al, 2009](https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=19620915) compared 1 RM of lat-pull with max reps of pull-ups and lat-pulls (at 80% of 1RM). There was a **moderate correlation between lat-pull 1RM and number of pull-ups**, but not between number of pull-ups and number of lat-pulls. They conclude that this low correlation between exercises indicate that they should not substitute one another.


### Safety
**Shoulder impingement** is the trapping of rotator’s cuff tendons during shoulder movements. It can be caused by repeated movement, like overdoing with Pull-ups. A study [Prinold et al, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916995/) was performed to determine if pull-up technique differences could increase or decrease risk of impingement. The authors concluded that **reverse technique (chin-ups) and wide technique have movement patterns that could indicate higher risk** of injury.

Case reports of **rhabdomyolysis** exist associated as pull-ups. One example is presented by [Kiberd et al, 2011]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3216442/) who report a case that followed a short duration high-intensity training that included 84 pull-ups, 84 overhead shoulder presses with 30-lb dumbbells.

[Progress] 2 years,ibn4n,870,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cmjyp7/progress_2_years/,1565054236.0,"So admittedly this is about progress in general. Not all of it is bodyweight fitness. But its been a journey, and this has been a huge part of slowly rebuilding my self confidence.

Two years ago, I was in the midst of my divorce. I was thin to begin with, but when [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/2mghKNO.jpg) was taken, I hadn't eaten in over a week. This was about 3 weeks after I attempted to hang myself.

[Here I am today](https://i.imgur.com/K6f6pFB.jpg). I have a long ways to go until I'm happy with where I am, but I've made progress. And my mental health is better too. That's probably an even longer journey, but strides have been made.

Anyway, I don't have any friends, so I have no one to share my accomplishments with. I know its rather small, but I feel like I'm on the right path.

Edit: Progress post details:

Sex: Male
Weight: 130ish initially. 141 now. (seems like such a small increase)
Height: 6'0""
Age: 41

Diet: I didn't really do anything spectacular. I just paid attention to my calories in and out. I didn't want to be too far off in either direction. I wasn't big enough that I could sustain a deficit. But I also didn't want to gain weight. So I used a fitness tracker to estimate my calories burned, and I tried to stay within a few hundred of the result.

Weight lifted: Just bodyweight. Roughly, my program is 5 sets every morning of 5 pull ups, 4x10 seconds of abdominal contractions, 5 one legged squats and calf raises per leg, and 20 push ups. So by the time I go to work, I've done 25 pull ups, 200 seconds of abdominal contractions, 25 one legged squats per leg, and 100 push ups.

Distance Run: About 20k per week. I think a good question is ""why is this question important?"" If you are asking because you are wondering ""how many miles do I have to run to lose weight?"" then I think you're asking the wrong question. If you are trying to lose weight, then I think it has a lot more to do with diet than exercise. I can burn about 300 calories in 20-25 minutes of running. It isn't very time efficient. I usually skip breakfast and eat a small lunch, and then I pig out at dinner. As long as I'm under my calories for the day, I'm happy.


Edit: Thank you everyone! This was an amazing thing to wake up to. Thank you for all the support and positivity!"
2.5 year calisthenics transformation from nothing.,Haaspac,867,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/itb3x1/25_year_calisthenics_transformation_from_nothing/,1600183998.0,"https://www.reddit.com/user/Haaspac/comments/itaq0p/feb_18_to_today_sep_20/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Male 35 170lbs 2.5years of progress. Weighted and bodyweight calisthenics with maybe 5 months of basic barbell compounds. Diet for last 8 years has been ovo-lacto vegetarian. I dont track calories but i think my protein intake is close to 1g/lb.

Third picture (skinny me) could get maybe 3 chinups and 10 bad pushups. Im almost 35, vegetarian, my training has consisted of probably 90% calisthenics and 10% barbell. I just got a trapbar for doing deadlifts rows and farmers at home now, so we'll see how that goes.

Edit: my training philosophy was train harder than last time (even long before I heard about coach greg), I focused on pushups and pullups and all the variations and ways to train those 2 movements for a loooong time when i started and still do. I got mentally tough from doing an absurd number of reps. I added in direct arm work in the last year or so after researching all the different stuff I could do on my rings and watching fitnessfaqs and calisthenicsmovement on youtube. Everyone says beginners shouldnt train to failure but I did, a lot. I did some basic compound barbell work for 5ish months at the local gym until they were shutdown from covid. I got up to 225bench for 5x5, 345trapbar deadlift for 5x5, and squatted 295 for 4x6 were my last training numbers in feburary of this year. I just got a trapbar and plates for my garage so ill be doing deadlifts once/twice a week in addition to all my calisthenics stuff so i dont neglect my ass and legs entirely. I was never a fan of pistol squats even though i did them begrudgingly.

Edit 2: most people seem way too concerned with how i trained, and no one cares about how I ate. Eating right and sleeping 7-9 hours is way more important than how many reps i did. For example i have eaten pizza MAYBE 3 times this whole year. I dont drink any alcohol either. My dad loves to offer me donuts at work and i always tell him no. Eat your fruits and vegetables people. Stop eating food with a laundry list of ingredients you cant pronounce. Do you want gainz or a 500 calorie treat for your mouth? Liquid is water, black coffee, and soymilk, thats it. 80 calories a day come from liquid, and i only know that because i just opened the fridge and looked. You cant get fat eating broccoli and spinach my dudes.

Edit 3: lots of people seem way too concerned about what my sets reps and rest breaks were, trying to get as nitty gritty as you can. How about i explain it this way. People in this thread said my chest was lacking. Thats fine, and probably a fair point, so on my day off today im playing some destiny this morning drinking coffee before i go take my dogs for a long walk. In between pvp matches or flying between planets im doing slow eccentric with a pause at the top and bottom diamond pushups, making sure my lats are flexed and scapula are depressed making my chest do all the work. Each rep is about 4 seconds. Every set was taken to complete collapsing on the ground body shaking grunting failure. The first set i did 28 reps which took about 1.5 minutes of time under tension, and now im somewhere around 15 sets in and im only able to do about 8-10 reps. Thats 15 hard as shit sets to failure. My chest is going to be in agony tomorrow, but should be ok to do dips on friday at the same tempo for lots more sets, then ive got saturday sunday and monday for my chest shoulders and triceps to recover from that huge volume. I hope this explains my work ethic better. Have you done 15+ sets to failure in a row?"

Around the same time, I saw some monthly push up challenges on the sub trying to collectively reach one million push-ups. 

Quite the challenge, but could I do it on my own? Given enough time, I think so, and with the goal of being in better shape this next decade, I’m going for it!

1 million push-ups in my 30’s means 100k a year or 274 every day.

I could bang out 3-4 chin-ups, but pull-ups were a no-go. I stuck to scapular pulls, dips etc and bought some resistance bands and really worked my back and shoulders, but I never just went back and *tried* a pull-up after I was warmed up and ""stronger.""

For example, yesterday work was crazy, I had a bunch of errands to run, and I just wasn't feeling up to doing a full workout. So in the evening, I just resigned to doing a workout that was short but still got my heart rate up and made my day a ""non-zero"" day.

At the start of February I found this subreddit and despite finding it interesting (cheaper than a gym, able to do it from home) never followed up on it.

I was out shopping maybe 3 weeks later and bought a jar of pickled gherkins [(one of these badboys)](https://img.tesco.com/Groceries/pi/040/5901713000040/IDShot_540x540.jpg) and found I couldn't open it! I was so disappointed that I lacked the strength to open something literally anyone could've picked up off the shelf and opened. That was the final straw!

After starting with rr on the 26th of February, today I reached my first goal: to open that jar of pickles! I ate 3 immediately after so if you want to know what victory tastes like, imagine 3 consecutive gherkins.

Otherwise I'm really enjoying rr, I've already noticed big changes (i.e. actual muscle) and I feel better overall.

I've also recently been able to hold the L sit for ~5 seconds! I've already improved so much compared to when I started (couldn't do chin ups, push ups, longer than 60s planks) and I can't wait to go further!

Video Updates for the RR: How to do Proper Pullups and how to achieve them if you can't do any!,Antranik,853,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7vxd3e/video_updates_for_the_rr_how_to_do_proper_pullups/,1518021585.0,"I just published two fresh videos that are specifically meant to improve upon the videos that we have for the [Recommended Routine. (""RR"")](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) 

# [1. How to do Proper Pullups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9knQsSe23o)

* In this video I talk about the two phases of a pullup: Emphasizing the scapular pull in the beginning (with straight arms) and then the actual pullup.  I also include tips in regards to keeping better form such as to keep your feet uncrossed (and in front of you) as well as to NOT do half-ROM pullups which are *super* common unfortunately (go all the way down!).

# [2. How to do pullups if you can't do any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLjb-iXpxWE)

* And in the second one, I demonstrate how to perform negative pullups properly, emphasizing the goal of being able to do 10-second negatives eventually as well as *the importance of lifting/tucking the knees up as you lower down so that your feet dont hit the ground before your arms are straight.*

* If you can't control the negative, then you need to work on your rows (incline rows to be exact) which are an easier pulling exercise and a prerequisite for pullups. In the RR, we recommend you get to 3 sets of 8 reps (""3x8"") of horizontal rows before moving to the pullup progression.

* If you are unsure how or where to do rows, review the video on [rows here](https://youtu.be/rloXYB8M3vU).

I hope the content helps you out as well as serves to improve the overall quality of the RR! Please feel free to ask questions and leave feedback!"

My Handstand Journey And My Advice To You,TheHardyAmoeba,848,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/idli61/my_handstand_journey_and_my_advice_to_you/,1597966284.0,"Hey all,

I am ecstatic to be here. After years of trying to get a freestanding handstand, I finally feel like I’m in a place that allows me to give decent advice. 

Before we get into the advice, here’s a bit about me and my freestanding handstand (FSHS) journey. I’m a 21 year old male, 5’8”, 160 pounds. I’ve been trying to get a FSHS for several years. My training took a heavy calisthenics turn in the past year and my main focus has been FSHS for roughly the past 8 months. Prior to that, my handstand work was very intermittent, consisting of cycles of me working on it for a month or two and giving up for several months.

FSHS is currently the only high skill calisthenics movement in my repertoire other than muscle ups (both strict and kipping, rings and bar) and a 12 second front lever.

My current max FSHS is 45 seconds. Along with duration, my percentage of successful kickups (kickups that don’t result in me immediately falling over) has improved dramatically and on some days is near 100%. My handstand has a slight asymmetry (I lean a bit to my right), so my current goals are fixing the asymmetry and getting a freestanding handstand pushup (FS HSPU), and I am making good progress on both goals. I’ll be sure to make a post about handstand asymmetry and FS HSPU once I’m successful, and may also make a post about front lever in the future.

This post has six sections of advice: 

* Things to do before starting handstand work. 
* Things to do against a wall before starting freestanding handstand work. 
* Advice on FSHS.
* General advice on handstand.
* Specific advice on handstand.
* The most important piece of advice on FSHS.

Note that in this post I generally differentiate between handstand work (stuff that results in you being upside down, whether against a wall or not) and freestanding handstand work (stuff that results in you being upside in an open space, with no usage of a wall).

So now onto the advice. Please note that the **only piece of advice that really matters is at the very end of this post.** If you want to skip the fluff and get to the core of what you really need to get a FSHS, skip to the end. Also, keep in mind that there are many ways to get to the end goal that is a FSHS. I am by no means an expert, and this post is by no means exhaustive.

**STUFF TO DO BEFORE STARTING HANDSTAND TRAINING:**

1. **Have decent shoulder and (especially) triceps strength.** You don’t need superhuman triceps, but you do need moderately strong triceps otherwise you won’t be able to make multiple handstand attempts in a single session. Pushups, overhead presses, and wall handstands can all help you build shoulder and tricep strength. You’ll also get increasingly strong triceps as you continue your handstand training, so don’t worry about strength too much.
2. **Have decent overhead shoulder mobility.** Again, you don’t need superhuman mobility, nor do your shoulders have to have identical mobility. You just need decent enough mobility to start your training. If you have enough mobility to touch your thumbs overhead to a wall while standing with your back against it and squeezing your lower back into the wall, you should have good enough mobility to start. There’s many ways to increase mobility, look up videos and choose the stretches and exercises you like.
3. **Work on your wrist mobility and strength**. Handstands are very tough on the wrists, and working on wrist mobility and strength early on will help prevent injury. There’s many stretches and exercises you can do. A good one to start with is GMB Fitness’ “Wrist prep routine.” I use a very similar routine. It doesn’t need to take you more than 2-5 minutes at the beginning of each session. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE&t=102s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE&t=102s) 
4. **You need a moderately strong core.** There’s many ways to improve core strength. In my opinion, the most useful core exercises in preparation for handstand are hollow body exercises, planks, and side planks. Hollow body work is difficult, so you will likely have to do hollow body progressions before moving onto full hollow body holds and hollow rocks. Look up hollow body progressions if you haven’t heard of them before.
5. **Consider doing rotator cuff strengthening exercises.** Calisthenics is tough on the joints and it may be a good idea to bulletproof your shoulders BEFORE starting handstand training.

**WALL-DEPENDENT STUFF TO DO BEFORE STARTING FSHS TRAINING:**

1. **If you haven’t already, now is a good time to start doing wall handstands.** While both the back-to-wall and wall-facing handstands have their pros and cons, I recommend starting with back-to-wall handstands first. First, just practice kicking up and getting comfortable being upside down. You’ll have a bit of a banana back for now and that’s okay. Try to get your hands fairly close to the wall. Once you feel comfortable upside down, you can start working on balance. Move one foot off the wall, then push yourself off the wall by both pushing lightly off the wall with the other foot and pushing through into the floor with your fingers. You’re going to create a brief point of balance before you inevitably fall back to the wall. After doing this for a while you’ll be able to create short, couple second periods of “freestanding” balance.
2. **Once you’ve done back-to-wall practice, it may be helpful to do some wall-facing practice.** Many experts say that wall-facing handstands are vital - I’m not so sure that they’re vital, but they can certainly be helpful. There are a few ways to get into a wall-facing handstand - look them up and choose the one you’re most comfortable with. Once you’re in a wall-facing handstand, get your hands as close to the wall as you can. Practice bailing out safely, because it’s a scary position to be in and your fear will prevent you from moving your hands close to the wall (I always twist clockwise when bailing, but find what works best for you). Similar to the back-to-wall handstand, push off with your foot and try to create a brief point of balance. The main benefit of a wall-facing handstand is that it helps improve your body line, reduce your banana back, and give you a more accurate picture of what it will feel like to be in a freestanding handstand.
3. **Once you’ve been practicing wall handstands and can achieve brief points of balance (ideally at least a few seconds) fairly often, you can focus more on nailing your kick up** (although you will still continue to work on your balance). Practice kicking up at various distances from the wall. Your goal here will be to kick up into a handstand without letting your foot touch the wall. The benefit of doing this with a wall is that if you miss you just land against the wall instead of having to bail. Once you get good at this you’ll be able to kick up fairly far from the wall and nail a balance point most of the time. You should be succeeding in the majority of your kickups and able to hold (at minimum) couple second handstands BEFORE attempting FSHS in an open space.

**YOU’VE PUT IN THE WORK, AND NOW YOU’RE READY TO MOVE TO FSHS:**

1. Find an open space and start kicking up into freestanding handstands. It’s quite likely you’ll fail a lot, whether that be from underbalancing (not kicking up enough) or overbalancing (kicking up too much and having to bail). On days where you’re not hitting many successful kickups it may be helpful to do a couple kickups using the wall to remind yourself what a good point of balance feels like. Don’t let your ego drive you. If you need to make use of the wall, make use of the wall.

**GENERAL TIPS FOR HANDSTAND.** 

1. **DO NOT overdo it with your training.** Connective tissue heals significantly slower than muscle and if you overdo it with ANY calisthenics training (that includes handstands), I promise you WILL injure yourself. Warm up before your workouts. Take frequent rest days. Be mindful of how your body is feeling and take it easy if something is hurting. Trust me, I’ve had my fair share of connective tissue injuries and they take a ton of time to heal and WILL set you back. There’s some evidence that collagen supplementation can help improve connective tissue healing time, so I take 5g of Fortigel collagen everyday. It’s fairly expensive ($40 for two months), but it may be worth it if your main focus is calisthenics. I’ve noticed I feel more resilient to injury since starting collagen supplementation, but of course this could be placebo - do your own research.
2. **Find a training frequency schedule that works for you.** Some people might prefer 15 minute sessions 4-5 times a week, while some might prefer 30 minute training sessions 2-3 times a week, and still others might prefer 5 minute sessions twice a day 5 days a week. There are pros and cons to all schedules, and you’ll probably alter your schedule anyways as you progress through your training. I currently do two days on, two days off, with my days on including roughly 30 minutes of pure handstand work on top of whatever other work I may do. Whatever you do, just don’t injure yourself.
3. **Video your training.** The earlier you start videoing your training, the earlier you’ll be able to notice issues that can be fixed. Video yourself at different angles.
4. **Get a coach.** I chose to not get a coach because I wanted to be able to say I achieved a solid FSHS without one. That being said, having either an in-person coach or an online coach with whom you can converse would likely speed your progress tremendously.
5. **Take occasional multi-day breaks.** If you’ve been training handstands a few months and are feeling a little burned out (or have nagging wrist or shoulder pain), that’s okay. Take a week off and focus on other stuff. You may resume your training and find that you’ve actually improved after not doing any handstand stuff for a week - this has happened to me with handstand work, muscle up work, etc. Just make sure your week off doesn’t turn into more than two weeks off. 
6. **Use youtube, reddit, and other sites to get good advice.** There’s plenty of great channels, posts, and blogs out there on how to get a handstand. Find ones you like and try to implement their advice.

**SPECIFIC TIPS FOR HANDSTAND:**

1. **Choose your method of kickup.** There are many ways to kick up but two general ways - you can place your hands on the ground, get into a “runner’s start” position, and kick up; or you can start while standing and simultaneously place your hands on the ground and kick up. There are pros and cons to each. I have tried both, and currently am more successful with the second method. The benefit of the first method is that your hand placement is more consistent and in general the method is more controlled. The benefit of the second method is that it’s easier to get momentum to kick up into a good point of balance.
2. **Choose your hand placement.** Your hand placement can be wide or narrow. A more wide hand placement may be necessary if your shoulder mobility sucks (although you should be working on shoulder mobility very early on). A more narrow handstand will allow you to better stack your joints and maintain balance, and is the ultimate hand placement you should be pursuing.
3. **Bend your fingers.** In general, your fingers should be slightly bent  - i.e. not flat on the floor. This will best allow you to provide force to the ground, but more on that below in point 7.
4. **Choose your hand angle.** This isn’t the most important thing, but you should decide what angle to place your hands at. Some people prefer having their index finger pointing forward, while others prefer ring finger pointing forward. There are other angles too. Choose what works best for you. 
5. **To shoe or not to shoe.** It may be beneficial to practice handstands without shoes. Shoes provide extra weight at a position far from your balance point and may make balancing more difficult, just as wearing shoes during a front lever may make the hold more taxing. Obviously, it is not always feasible to workout without shoes on.
6. **Create that balance. This is an extremely important point.** **Your goal should not be to find balance, but rather to create it.** Your balance point is not some elusive thing that you “find.” **You are the master of your body, and you must create it yourself**. You should be creating balance in both your wall dependent handstand attempts and your FSHS attempts. Creating this balance depends mostly on using your wrists and fingers, as I mentioned above. You can actually see this creation of balance when watching an experienced person nail a kickup. They will usually slightly overshoot their balance point when kicking up before immediately making minor adjustments (via their hands) to move themself back into that balance point. Note that it’s generally better to overshoot your balance point than undershoot because the former (overbalancing) is easier to correct than the latter (underbalancing).
7. **Use your wrists and fingers. This is an extremely important point.** Your wrists and fingers are responsible for probably 90% of your balance. If you are underbalancing, you’ll need to shift your weight from your fingers toward your palms (again, this is difficult). If you’re overbalancing, you’ll need to flex your wrists and press into the ground with your fingers. Oftentimes I see people talking about the importance of fingers and ignoring the wrists. I’ll make an analogy here to help you see how important wrist flexion is for handstands. When you are standing upright as humans do and you lean back, you press into your heels to maintain balance. When you lean forward, you push with the ball of your foot (plantar flexion), and if that isn’t enough to prevent you from falling forwards, you also push with your toes. Just as you use both your ankle and your toes to prevent yourself from falling forward when upright, you must push down with both your wrists and fingers when in danger of falling forward (overbalancing) in a handstand. If you rely only on fingers and ignore your wrists, it will be much harder to balance.

**As a side note on hands,** when you first start your training you’ll make giant, infrequent overcompensations/adjustments with your wrists and hands that make you lose your balance. As you progress, you’ll get better at making constant small adjustments to maintain your balance. It’s like driving a car. A new driver will make large jerky adjustments to the wheel while an experienced driver will make constant small adjustments to maintain their position on the road.

8. **Use other body parts to balance? Maybe.** As I mentioned above, 90% of your balance comes from fingers and wrist. The other 10% comes from movement of your shoulders, hips, and legs. As you progress through your journey, you will get better at using these body parts to maintain balance (they are especially relevant in correcting underbalance), but as a beginner you should be focusing mainly on your fingers and wrists. After all, a good handstand is one in which you can use your hands to maintain balance regardless of the position or movement of the rest of your body.

9. **Keep a fairly tight core.** Your body should be tight and stacked. You’ll get better at this as you progress through your journey. It is easier to balance when your core is tight, just as it is easier to balance a brick upright than a slinky.

10. **Shrug your shoulders.** Shrug your shoulders and push your body toward the sky. This will help with balance. To get a feel for what I’m saying, raise your arms straight over your head and shrug them as high as possible, with the goal of trying to touch your shoulders to your ears. This shrug should be what you’re aiming for in a handstand. Again, you’ll get better at this as you move through your journey.

11. **Squeeze your feet together and point your toes.** This both looks good and will help you with your balance.

**THE MOST IMPORTANT TIP:**

**If you do not follow this piece of advice, then nothing I said above will be of use to you.** 

**Be persistent.** NO piece of advice can get you a handstand if you are not persistent. You will fall hundreds, if not thousands of times. I surely have. You will get frustrated. You may even wonder at times if you have a proprioceptive deficit that precludes you from ever achieving a handstand. I know I did. You will definitely hit plateaus at times, and may occasionally backtrack. It has happened to me probably 10 times where I was making progress one week and then the next week miraculously lost all of that progress. Stuff like this happens. Regardless of what techniques you use, you WILL get it eventually. It may take a week, a year, or 5 years. Everyone is different. All you can do is be persistent and commit yourself to constant improvement.

Calisthenics and hand balancing is about the journey just as much as it is about the endpoint. The thing I love about it is that it requires extreme work ethic, persistence, and patience. No one can give you what you want, you’ll have to work for it. Oh, and also, you fight gravity and WIN. How freakin' cool is that??

&#x200B;

I succeeded after months of almost daily training and failure because I wanted it badly. 

**How badly do you want it?**

The explanations here are great, but seeing the exercises in action really helps.

One thing I found in looking at the many training videos on youtube is that most of them are made by these incredibly muscular guys who can do every exercise perfectly.  This is so far from where I am as a beginner, though its important to see them being done right.

So I enjoyed this video which shows a pretty normal looking guy in his messy little apartment doing the RR over the course of a year.  It shows him doing it well, doing it badly and falling, his setbacks, his progressions, how he adapts the RR for his limited equipment and space, and what he did wrong and learned along the way.

I thought I'd share this for the other beginners like me who need someone to relate to.

My 1 year Calisthenics Evolution,jul13n25,846,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hnellv/my_1_year_calisthenics_evolution/,1594203861.0,"Hi there!

# My stats:

My name's Julien, I'm 18 years old and I'm 171cm tall (5'7"") for 63kg (139 lb). 

# My journey:

I would like to present you my transformation that took place over a year. This transformation is more of an evolution since physical development was not one of my priorities when I started Street Workout.

I started my journey in January 2017 and at that time I was really starting from 0, I couldn't even do a single pull-up. So I started by doing 1,5 year of set&rep and endurance, working only the basic skills (muscle-up and handstand). I gained a lot of strength without really developing physically but again, that wasn't really my goal. 

In June 2019, I was finally able to start working on the skills that had pushed me to start this sport, namely the planche and the front lever. Today, one year later, I am really happy to say that I have unlocked all the skills that made me dream such as the Full Planche, Front Lever, 90° Handstand Push-up, and a few others.

# My program:

From July 2019 to February 2020, I did 3 trainings a week.

* 2 Planche's training
* 1 Front lever's training

Then, from February 2020 to today, I do 5 trainings a week:

* 3 Planche's training
* 2 Front lever's training

To make this transition, I obviously had to decrease the intensity of my workouts, which allowed me to add more volume. This transition helped me a lot to progress in all the static movements; that's how I could go from 5s of Front lever to 12s and from 4-5s of straddle planche to 10s.

As for the workouts themselves, I did 3 main exercises each time and I added some secondary exercises (it really depends on you). 

For the Planche :

* 3x3 assisted leans to planche (I show this exercise a lot in my transformation video below)
* 3x5-8s assisted straddle planche hold
* 3x3-5 HSPU

And for the Front lever:

* 3x8s assisted front lever hold
* 3x3 assisted front lever raises
* 3x5 adv. tuck front lever pull up

# My progress in video (from June 2019 to June 2020)

I hesitated a lot before making a video about my transformation, I did feel like I wasn't good enough but I managed to overcome this feeling by telling myself that it could motivate or even inspire other people to either start or continue.

I've never used any editing software before, so the result is not very professional but I'm quite happy with it. So I'd love to hear your opinions on the quality of the video, and on the content itself of course.

Here is the link : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de3Igxk1jsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de3Igxk1jsU)

# What I've learned (and what worked for me):

* Regarding static skills, more volume is more useful than more intensity
* For a long time I underestimated the importance of time under tension, now I only do assisted holds with resistance bands to increase this time under tension.
* Listen to your body, don't train when you don't feel it. The adage ""no pain no gain"" is bullshit (in my opinion).
* Note down everything you do at each training session to see where you come from and to re-motivate yourself when you have the impression to stagnate (I have an excel document with all my trainings since 2018, I assure you it's motivating).
* Don't hesitate to take a week of the deload regularly, I also underestimated its power for a long time but it really helps to recharge your energy.
* If you stagnate for too long, change your program. It sounds kind of logical as advice, but in the beginning, I convinced myself that my program was perfect and made excuses for the fact that I wasn't making any progress.

# What next?

I think it's time for me to build up some muscle mass. Now that I've reached my goals in static skills, I'm going to try to maintain them for the next 2-3 months while increasing my mass. After that, I would like to start training really advanced gymnastic movements, such as maltese or planche on rings.

# Conclusion

I hope this post may have brought you something, be it inspiration, motivation or even help. If you have any comments, questions or if you need advice, I would be delighted to hear and respond to them.

I wish you all the best for the future,

Cardiovascular Endurance: Improving the Cardiovascular & Respiratory System,None,846,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gyreff/cardiovascular_endurance_improving_the/,1591588319.0,"I jumped on reddit this morning and seen a post from /u/DreamerDUd about improving their cardiovascular endurance. Dreamer mentioned that after about five minutes of running made it hard for them to breath. 

So I would like to share information I have found helpful and improvements I have noticed after the last two months of running. I hope dreamer doesn't mind me using them as an example in this post.

**Cardiovascular & Respiratory System:**

The cardiovascular and respiratory system work together in order to transport oxygen and nutrients around the body, as well as removing waste. When we breath in oxygen it arrives at the lungs where it will go through a process called gas diffusion. Here carbon dioxide is removed from the blood stream and swapped out with new clean oxygen. This new oxygen allows the body to create additional fuel for our muscle to function aerobic exercise.

The efficiency of this system is dependent on how well your heart and lungs can circulate new oxygen and blood. When you experience an increased breathing rate it is a sign that body tissue has an increased demand for oxygen. Thankful with appropriate exercise we can improve both the cardiovascular and respiratory system.

**Aerobic Exercise can force adaptations:**

As mentioned we can improve both the cardiovascular and respiratory system through exercise. 

For the Cardiovascular System, aerobic exercise can adaptations through the following components:

*  **Heart Size:** Muscular walls of the heart (particularly the left ventricle) thickens, creating more powerful contractions
* **Stroke Volume:** Increases the amount of blood pushed through per beat
* **Resting Heart Rate:** Rest HR decreases with an increased Stroke Volume (SV)
* **Cardiac Output:** This has no significant changes when you are at rest, or with low intensity exercise. However, it does improve significantly during maximal intensity.
* **Capillarisation:** Body will adapt with increased blood vessels, meaning more blood can flow to muscles as the demand for oxygen and nutrients increase.

These adaptations really depend on the intensity and duration of the exercise. Cardiac Output will improve with longer and more intense exercises.

Much like the Cardiovascular System, the Respiratory System responds in the same way. Regular bouts of exercise with the correct level of intensity can create adaptations.

* **Increased Stamina:** Much like the muscles you see on the outside, the internal muscles improve with exercise when put under pressure, allowing them to work for longer periods of time
* **Greater Volume of Oxygenated Blood:** Because there is more oxygen, the blood has more oxygen to pass on to the muscle tissue. This is why these two systems work so well together
* **Increased Alveoli:** These are the little sacks that allow for gas diffusion the transfer of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood
* **More Capillaries in lungs and tissue:** More Capillaries means more efficient delivery of oxygen to the tissues.
* **Increased Lung Capacity:** The lungs will like increase in size by 15% during training, allowing for more oxygen to be inhaled

**Personal Training Experience:**

I was never one for cardio pre covid, I hiked a couple of times per month, but any intense level of cardio was practically non existent. It wasn't until I was learning about the cardiovascular and respiratory system in response to exercise and how they could improve my health and longevity (family heart issues) that I know I needed to implement this into my training.

During the lock down I was experimenting with a sedentary life style and how my body would react after a few weeks of poor food choices and physical inactivity. (ill probably write about this another time). 

Training begun with simply walking 1.6km per day for a week. I was doing this with my girlfriend. Training with a friend or someone who also has similar goals keeps you accountable and also gives you a chance to share your experiences after training.

After a week, we picked up the pace and started a combination of jogging and running. We continued the 1.6km distance, a few runs later we up'd the distance to 3.6km and I developed how we will train

We would run 3.6km per day for three days and have one day off as a break, then repeat the three days again. Some days you will find your body may not like the run. I experienced a few strains which can be improved through stretching and resting.

During these three day splits we would up the distance to 5km, but we would only do this on what I call ""**a feels good basis"".** The feels good basis is understanding your body and what it is capable of during exercise. Sometimes you need to feel confident about your physical ability and sometimes you need to put your ego down for one or may two training sessions.

We both worked a 3.6km or 5km run following the three day split along with the feels good basis for about 5-6 weeks. Eventually both wanted to run longer and by the sixth week I noticed my body was adapting to the training so we set Sunday as the day we would run 10km. 

Now we run for 3-4km in the morning before work, following the 3 day split and 10km on Sundays. Morning runs will likely be up'd to 5km in the near future along (1-2 weeks) with 10km up'd in the next 4-6 weeks.

**Note I:** Its about training smart. Often I hear about people wanting to achieve X physical thing and they go too hard and too fast. They will often give up before they have even started, you cannot force positive adaptations. It takes time, patience and discipline. 

**Note II:** Pace is everything and it takes time to master, dont run because you want it to be done faster, instead focus on developing pace where you can maintain a level of intensity that is manageable. Meaning you still feel like you are working hard, but not over working where you literally need to stop and take a breath

**Personal Adaptations:**

This is merely my own personal experience and some adaptations my girlfriend has experienced since running.

* **Breathing Rate:** By the sixth week I noticed something strange with my running, I felt like I was breaking normally (as if I was walking) it was the strangest experience I have ever felt.
* **Skeletal Adaptations:** I have flat feet, so when I first started running I would often get pain in my feet and my partner would also have pain in her hip and knee. Within four weeks of training this was non existent.
* **BPM and High Stress Situations:** You ever been in those situations where your heart rate increases and you can feel the fight or flight response. Since training I have noticed I am more calm in those situations
* **Physical Activities:** I noticed by the fifth week mark when I was wheel barrowing concrete (7m3) up a hill my ability to perform this work was significantly easier than expected, no shortness of breath or needing prolonged breaks.
* **Mental Wellbeing:** More energy throughout the day, better moods and more enjoyable life

**Recommendations:**

In Dreamers case I would recommend developing their cardiovascular endurance by slowly increasing the duration and intensity of aerobic exercise. Additionally, interval training would probably be a good option given the nature of the basket ball.

This could be running lengths of the court for X number of times, a rest period, then repeat. Maybe add in the ball in with the training so they could become familiar with the feel of the ball and running.

**Disclaimer:** I just want to point out that this is my own personal experience and its purpose is for education. If you do suffer any diseases or disorders such as heart disease, hypertension or anything that could put your health at risk. Please see your personal doctor before training. Again, its important to train intelligently and insure the health and safety of your personal health is at the front of your exercise choices"
"Caliathletics.com - Warning, refuses to refund",Laserbach,844,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cvaws1/caliathleticscom_warning_refuses_to_refund/,1566751878.0,"Hi,for getting started in bodyweight fitness I thought it would be a good idea to get a payed program for saving time researching and building a plan by myself.

So I came across   [https://caliathletics.com/](https://caliathletics.com/)  which proudly claims on their page the following:

***SATISFATION GUARANTEE***

*Guaranteed results or your money back! If unsatisfied with Full Body Transformation results, simply contact us to get a refund.* [*Click here*](https://caliathletics.com/terms-conditions/) *to view full Return Policy*

This ensured me to give the program a try. After payment I very quickly realised that this hasn't been at all what I've been looking for, I simply wanted a program / app for mobile use, which gives me some easy to follow routines, instructions on the exercises and an easy way to track the process. In the case of  **Caliathletics.com** it provides lengthy fancy edited videos that are way too heavy to consume for a quick workout and the general workout plan comes in a pdf which isnt at all what I wanted.

For this reason I of course immediately contacted the support to initiate the refund and cancel my subscription, making use of their satisfaction guarantee. What happened was that I've been ignored for 3 days and now finally got the lovely reply:

***Dear Lars , you exactly knew what is the product you were purchasing. No refunds in such a case.***

***Regards , Filip***

Does anyone have a similar experience with them? I hope this post serves as warning for other newcomers..

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much for your advice and recommendations, I didnt expect my post to receive any attention, great community ♥

Edit 2: I'm overwhelmed by receiving so much support from you guys. I don’t even care for the money, is there a good cause (preferred in connection to r/bodyweightfitness) that could make use of a little donation in case I get the refund? I for sure keep you updated.

Edit 3:   
Today I finally received the decision from Paypal in regards to the refund! So to anyone who is interested or maybe has a similar situation, Paypal decided that I deserve the refund and I should within the next 5 days get the payment back to my account.

As many suggested, I have provided a very detailed description of the case and added screenshots, I think this helps a lot if anyone finds himself in the same situation, so thanks a lot for the advice!

In case anyone is wondering: I decided to stick with the RR, after investing a bit of time to learn how to perform the exercises and figuring out my levels I now only need a stop watch on my phone, no need for any extra programs or apps. It may sound tempting for newcomers to use a payed app / program to kickstart the journey but for me it was totally not worh it.

Also I didn’t receive any suggestions for **Edit2** (see above), don’t hesitate to comment or to drop me a PM."
"Strength Training: Whatcha gonna do with all that rest, all that rest between those sets?",ellitron,842,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dj9do2/strength_training_whatcha_gonna_do_with_all_that/,1571332076.0,"OK so for strength training it's generally recommended to rest 3-5 minutes between your sets to allow for sufficient recovery of the muscle, which I find to be about right for me (less than 3 minutes and my reps start to tank). But standing around for 3-5 minutes after every set feels like a massively suboptimal use of time. In the past I've been more hypertrophy focused where the rest times are shorter, and I'd also superset all the exercises, so I basically end up with \~30-45 seconds rest between exercises in a superset, which I'd typically fill with in-place jogging or step-ups or something to keep my heart-rate up, which I found lead to a significant increase in stamina through the workout. I actually started off doing supersets with strength-focused workouts, but I found this to be too taxing. Maybe this is a matter of conditioning? I'm not sure. Currently I'm trying to fill the time with either stretching or light cardio.

So my question to you all, is, in your strength focused workouts / exercises, what do you do with your 3-5 minutes? Do you superset with something else? Cardio? Stretching? Yoga? Meditation? Journal? High-frequency trading?

Would love to hear about what you all do. Maybe it's a mental thing but going from my usual workouts involving more-or-less continuous movement to 3-5 minutes between sets is driving me nuts.

EDIT: Some folks seem to be confused by the 3-5 minute rest period. I realize the term is overloaded, but by ""strength training"" I mean you're optimizing for strength (instead of hypertrophy or endurance), so you're doing an exercise with enough weight (or a certain bodyweight progression) so that you can only do 3-6 reps each time without going to failure (leaving a bit in the tank for the next set), which is somewhere between 80-95% of your 1RM. Overall you're aiming for 3-6 sets of 3-6 reps, and it's recommended to rest 3-5 minutes between sets. Opinions may vary, but this is generally what I see as recommended if you're training for pure strength. In my case, I'm working weighted pull-ups in my current progression towards one arm pull ups, but AFAIK the same idea generally applies to any rep oriented exercise involving a major muscle group."

I am asking this because this pandemic fiasco is not going anywhere soon. I do not feel safe exercising out in any park or gym. I feel comfortable exercising in small spaces with no one looking at me. This may be because I am a total beginner and have body image issues.

My question is simple: What does it really take to get fit at home using calisthenics? Can routines like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay15dc2cvm0&t=387s&ab_channel=MinusTheGym) be really effective? I don't want to get more demotivated by trying random stuff.

Long time bodyweight fanatics who do it just for the sake of being healthy and fit, can you please advise based on your own experiences?

P.S : I can't do a single pullup. I can do 4 shaky floor pushups. I can squat pretty well though. I don't want to get super buff. I just want a lean muscular physique which is generally healthy and fit. I have my diet checked. I have maintained the same weight of 69 Kgs for over a year. Entirely home cooked food.

I've spent every spare moment of the last few weeks creating this [One Arm Push-Up Guide](https://youtu.be/0NLoE4UMbhI) video and a [Simple Infographic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WZF-9GnXtni6HLiglEUBUnJ0HBwnZXTN/view?usp=sharing) that should help you achieve it.

For reference, I've been training calisthenics for over two years. The one arm push up was the first strength skill I learned, so I thought it was fitting to make this my first guide on my channel.

Some of the things I cover in the video and infographic are:

* Picking the right progression
* Figuring out weekly volume
* Ways to progress/increase difficulty
* Things to watch out for

I also test to see how heavy of a weighted one arm push up I can do at the end! Surprised myself a bit on that one...

I hope you enjoy it as I spent a lot of time working on all this. And of course, I'm here to answer any and all questions you have about the One Arm Push up!"

6 Month Handstand Progress: What It Really Takes & 3 Biggest Lessons,calisthenics_hacker,836,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/afj0tf/6_month_handstand_progress_what_it_really_takes_3/,1547383466.0,"Some weeks ago it was shared here my 6 month handstand progress video and due to the good response I decided to create this post. Here’s the video:

[https://youtu.be/pvPq2sMACHc](https://youtu.be/pvPq2sMACHc)

On the journey from a 1s to 25s hold I learned some key insights you can use to progress faster or just improve your understanding about handstands. As a disclaimer, I’m not a certified coach but I’ve some solid background on biomechanics.

# What It Really Takes To Learn The Handstand:

1. **The 5 Minute Skill Work Myth:** as an average guy it was not possible  for me to just learn the handstand by just playing with handstands for 5 minutes before my strength work. As I’ll explain later I started to really progress when I had a complete 30+ minute handstand sessions covering all the different aspects (bodyline, balance, kick up).
2. **Strong Wrists Come First:** my loose wrist tendons made me stop training the handstand several times before. That’s why taking wrist condition more seriously and also using parallettes saved the day for me. Most of you won’t need to use parallettes but still conditioning your wrists is a huge part of long term success.
3. **Strong Shoulders Come Second:** most of the shoulder workouts tend to be “bent arm” which is great for building those muscles. However, for handstands that won’t be enough.  The shoulders are much more unstable than the hips and yet when doing handstand we pretend our shoulders to function as hips. To be honest your shoulders will automatically start adapting by spending quality time on handstands (here the importance of >30s chest to wall handstands). But you can accelerate the process by adding weighted exercises like “Bilateral Shoulder Circles”.

# The 3 Biggest Lessons:

1. **Handstands Are Like The Stock Market**: training handstands can be very frustrating. One day can be really good and the next so bad. Here it’s key to zoom out and don’t let the volatility of handstand training affect you. It’s the same as when you buy some shares of a company. Their price can go up and down in the short term without much reason. But over the long run the price will go up if the company invests in their products and their people. So for handstands if you follow ther right progressions and you don’t train mindlessly you’ll keep improving no matter the daily fluctuations.
2. **Divide And Conquer The Handstand**: the best way I found to approach handstand training is to do it with these 3 dimensions:
   1. **Bodyline**: your body has to be like a stick. As soon as it starts to wobble you’ll most likely fall from the handstand.
   2. **Balance**: once you’re upside down you need to be constantly reacting to the feedback that your body is giving you to avoid falling.
   3. **Kick Up**: you need a way to get into a handstand positions as precisely as possible and you’ve to be able to exit safely whenever you need to. (with these 3 things layed down it’s just a matter of objectively looking at your handstand and putting a plan to improve the areas you’re lacking)
3. **The Magic of Handstands**: as someone engineer minded I wish I could learn the handstand by just doing sets and reps. But the truth is that handstand is as much an art as a science which brings the psychological component. Still if you want to find some order I recommend you to track “handstand hold time” and “kick up success rate”.

If you can't do the handstand yet, I really encourage you to join this journey as it's one of best things you can find in bodyweight training."
If you are tall or heavy don't lose hope - full planche at 202cm 102kg/6'7 225lbs and other feats by heavyweight calisthenics athletes.,RockRaiders,836,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kts3gw/if_you_are_tall_or_heavy_dont_lose_hope_full/,1610203446.0,"Are you too tall or heavy to reach advanced calisthenics moves? The answer is not so obvious, I've found that some moves previously thought impossible past a certain height/weight have been achieved by giants, I'll share some examples. 

Based on some replies I got in the comments, I'll point out that it's very unlikely to reach the level of the outliers shown below because they have excellent genetics and some of them are on steroids (with at least one comment arguing that all of them are users), but the point is that the limit is much higher than many people expected, so someone smaller/with average genetics/natural has at least a tiny chance of reaching these moves, and maybe we'll see them done by even bigger people.

* **Full planche**: Jack Vinati, 202cm 102kg/6'7 225lbs, [this](https://www.instagram.com/jack.vinati/) is his Instagram page, currently his best hold was shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/fd7jQeyzlGA?t=374) where he also did an almost full range front lever row and one arm pull ups. He started calisthenics around 3 years ago and was coached by Alessandro Mainente, apparently in the past he was a pro basketball player who had to stop because of injuries.
* **One arm front lever**: Aziz Azizov, 195cm 100kg/6'4 220lbs, [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Js2P9C_la/) is a hold with the body almost entirely in the horizontal plane. He's also got an almost straight full planche.
* **Hefesto**: This one is a later addition, Leco Extremo, 200cm 82kg/6'7 180lbs. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJawuriKWYX/) you can see him hold an assisted Victorian cross, full planche, almost iron cross and he's the tallest I've seen do the hefesto. So you can see that tall and lanky/not very heavy for their height people can reach these moves. Is even this guy on steroids, for those who claim all of these athletes are?
* **One arm pull up**: Andrey Smaev is 185cm/6' and [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJoED6FLT-z/) his weight was 120kg/264lbs and he also added 16kg/35lbs as if it wasn't already hard enough. This man has monstrous strength, I've written about him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g75uy1/new_video_by_adam_raw_about_andrey_smaev/). However note that he admitted using steroids in a Russian interview, but he still has inhuman genetics.
* **Nordic hamstring curl**: [Lance Kearse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qms-wQKYILE), 6'7 240lbs/202cm 108kg pro basketball player.

I'll add the tallest/heaviest athlete for more moves (hefesto, iron cross?...) if I find some good examples, any suggestions?

There's a page on Instagram dedicated to giving recognition to big and strong calisthenics athletes, [Bar Giants](https://www.instagram.com/bar.giants/). It doesn't include people who are shorter than 185cm (almost 6'1) so here are some mentions of shorter but heavy and strong athletes or others I haven't seen on that page:

* [Vitaliy Feschuk](https://www.instagram.com/vitaliy.feschuk/) 182cm 100kg/5'11 220lbs, he's one of the world's strongest streetlifters and he's got a full planche, Maltese, iron cross, hefesto, front lever rows and many advanced moves.
* [David Nonemancher](https://www.instagram.com/davidnonnynonemacher/), 185cm 102kg/6'1 225lbs. He hasn't posted training clips recently, but in the past he showed a [full planche](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt9DowqhqSu/) and he's got strong legs too.
* Sebastiano Paitowschi, 191cm/6'3 and he held a [full planche](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSN11M0j2bz/) when he was 90kg/200lbs.
* [Filippo Pici](https://www.instagram.com/filippo_pici/), he's around 90kg/200lbs and has big legs and can hold a full Maltese cross, I don't know his height but I don't think he's very tall, he comes from a gymnastics background as far as I know.
* Tyson Edwards, he's quite tall and heavy and has big legs but I don't know the stats. He's held a [full planche](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-9vUhspfhm/).
* [Vlad (Darkgod Nation)](https://www.instagram.com/_d.nation_/), 178cm 90kg/5'10 220lbs, can do many planche and Maltese related elements.
* Later addition: u/Nombringer, [full planche](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJxuyV9JAqo/) at 188cm/6'2.
* Another addition: Olaf Kosten, [full planche](https://www.instagram.com/olaf_kosten/) at 188cm 93kg/6'2 205lbs.

Now it's true that many of these are probably genetically gifted and some of them take steroids, but years ago it seemed unthinkable to see someone 2m tall hold a full planche, so it's hard to say what are the true limits of an individual, and I think moves like the human flag, front lever and one arm pull up are achievable at almost any height. If you are very tall, to reach some of those moves you'll probably have to avoid gaining a lot of mass in the legs and train in an intelligent and structured manner for years, but who knows where the possibilities end?"
Why do body weight exercises leave me so much more tired than weights?,HuxTales,838,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lihd39/why_do_body_weight_exercises_leave_me_so_much/,1613154691.0,"So when the gyms were open and I was doing weight workouts, I would leave the gym pumped.

Why is there such a difference?

EDIT: Wow! This post took off way more than I expected. Thank you to everyone for all your answers, and I’m glad I’m not alone in feeling this way. And thank you for the awards. I’ve never gotten one before, so thank you very much!

For those wondering what my gym routine was in the “before time”, it was this. I’d start with deadlifts or squats (got up to about 60 pounds more than my body weight) and do at least 3 minutes between sets. Then I would do a giant super-set/circuit of bench press, rows, abs, hip thrusts, pulldowns/pull-ups, shoulder presses. I tried to get a variety of dumbbell and barbell work, and really only used machines when all the benches were taken. Once I started this circuit, I’d really only rest if I felt fatigued from a cardio perspective, since once I started the circuit I’d get at least 3 minutes between sets."
Had 61 y/o roommate in hospital - living proof that bwf rocks.,sirkarrde,836,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2uex7u/had_61_yo_roommate_in_hospital_living_proof_that/,1422805624.0,"Hey guys,

Just wanted to share a story, hopefully some of you will find it motivating. I had a tonsillectomy on Thursday so I had to spend a couple of days in hospital (plus 1 month off training, not cool.). Anyway, just when I arrive in the morning a guy comes in saying it seems like we're gonna be roommates. 

He was a fairly little guy, maybe around 175 cm (5'9"") and 70 kg (154 lbs). I guessed he was a couple of years younger than my dad, maybe around 40-45. He said he was an electrician here at the hospital, I told him I'm an engineering student so we started talking and somehow ended up talking about how it sucks to be out of training for weeks. He said: 'Tell me about it, I'm used to training 2,5 hours a day every day for 40 years, I don't know how I'm gonna handle it'. I frowned: '40 years? How old are you exactly?'. He was freaking 61 years old! Not a single grey hair, no wrinkles whatsoever and when we had to change to hospital gowns my jaw dropped. He was freaking ripped. He wasn't big at all, but he was so damn muscular I almost covered myself haha. And he told me I looked good and asked what I train, it was ridiculous. Still, I told him about bodyweight training and gymnastics and turned out he was doing the exact same thing, except for 40+ years! He does (weighted) calisthenics, lifts for lower body and does bench presses and he is an avid boxer as well.Plus he walks, runs or rides his bicycle everywhere, he hasn't used an elevator in decades!

Although his routine was pretty interesting (very high volume and frequency, for instance he does about 70+ reps of weighted decline push-ups as part of his warm up) it seemed to have worked out for him quite well. So I tried to suck in as much wisdom as possible in those two days but it always came down to these three things: eat clean, proper mobility and flexibility and form above everything else. 

Now, I'm sure most of us already know this, but it was great seeing the results in person. He didn't know a thing about nutrition or reps and sets when he started, he just figured he should eat natural and clean food and always keep his form in check. He told me he feels great, never had joint problems (or any health concerns for that matter except for his nose polyp now) and he just loves being alive. It was really inspiring when he told me never to train for girls or looks because those are short term goals.

Do you guys also experience the situation where you feel like you are hearing you breathing from your ears?,whiteSkar,836,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gcicmg/do_you_guys_also_experience_the_situation_where/,1588470483.0,"When I go to or go near to failure and get off, I start to feel like my ear is hearing my breath from my ears. Normally when you breathe, you can hear your breath from your nose. However, when this happens, I hear it from my ears as if the air is going through my ears, which I don't think it is.

This situation is mostly easily reached after doing pull ups to failure or near failure. It gets worse as I do more sets. Or in other words, it seems to happen when my heart rate is high due to exerting forces. Therefore, even though the RR says to rest 90 seconds between the sets in the pair, I have to rest longer in order to reduce this effect before doing the next set.

I am wondering if this is a common thing for people who train or a rare thing. Also, what is the name or how do you call this thing and what is your experience on this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Several people told me to lower my head below horizontal and it will go back to normal. I tried it and it actually works IMMEDIATELY! It's like magic. As soon as I lower my head below horizontal, BOOM, it's gone. Thank you everyone! (Caveat: it comes back after a few moment if my heart rate is still high. lol)"

[Posture] Journey to Greek God status,JTPTP,826,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ledndm/posture_journey_to_greek_god_status/,1612666352.0,"**Journey to “Perfect Posture”** (Perfect posture being the obvious proper alignment of the body for health reasons/performance but also for looks because I’m tired of looking like [Christian bale from The Machinist](https://www.ladbible.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=720,quality=70,format=jpeg,fit=pad,dpr=1/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-images.ladbible.com%2Fs3%2Fcontent%2F59e052f25a4f9808353306a979a700a4.png)) and being honest even if we lived in a word where perfect posture made you 20% weaker I would want it simply because it looks better. Sue me.

So, a little bit of a background. I’ve had bad posture my entire life, anterior pelvic tilt, rounded shoulders, upper back and forward neck plus an awkward left shoulder (Feels a bit off, like its not positioned right, I believe due to bad sleeping habits over the years)

Here is a 1 month [progression photo](https://ibb.co/cbbBv1c). Not from my current routine (Which should be better) I thought about adding pics from when I was younger, that show my posture being much worse, perhaps I will do this on a 6 month progression post. Photos like this are often misleading, it's hard to know what is relaxed or flexed etc., plus angles change things, the first photo hides my APT quite well but I know that it was bad back then, still is but not as much. Plus it's at an angle so it looks much worse when it's 100% side on. I’m going to try to do better pictures as the months go by.

My goal over the next year is to fix my bad posture and achieve great posture once and for all. No more fucking around with stretching sporadically and overall just being lazy. I will try to research as much as possible and come up with my own ‘’Perfect’’ routine to fix these issues. Another goal is also gaining muscle and learning gymnastic skills.

I will now talk about my routine and limited knowledge I have on fixing posture and exercise in general. Here is the link to my spreadsheet: [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFz7fYyg3pbaJ2JbsevVpvVfvIO7nIzZc7frreZ3mws/edit?usp=sharing) which covers my main calisthenics routine + stretching + posture routine.

My posture routine is quite hefty I feel, but I think its better to actually work out the muscles. Instead of tickling them, which is how I see most yoga sessions to improve posture, just not enough volume in my opinion. 

So let me tell you my entire plan from start to finish.

**Sleeping:**

This is a big mountain for me to climb. The position in which you sleep can have huge impacts in the development of your posture and unfortunately for me I can't fall asleep easy on my back (Which I believe to be the best position to sleep in for a individual without breathing problems, from my research)

I have slept my entire life in a fucked up position. On my stomach with my upper body rounded and twisting to one side pushing my left shoulder into a rounded position. I also used to place my head in my hand(forward head) all day at school and when I got back I would lay in bed with my neck jolting forward all evening playing games.

It’s safe to say that my sleeping habits and general posture habits were absolute dogshit.

**My sleep protocol** now is a cushion under my knees to put my lower back in a more favourable position + a low height cushion to support my neck(and only my neck), which will decrease in height as my body adjusts finally leading to no cushion. Also my mattress is firm so that is not an issue. People with soft mattresses (memory foam, worn out) can experience compromised sleeping posture. So the sleeping progression here is to sleep on my back the entire night like an angel without turning over and fucking it up.

**Morning protocol:**

This will be the time when I decompress my spine and stretch and move joints. The goal here is to wake up the body, nothing much just a quick spine decompression (Research suggests this is good to do in the morning after sleeping) + stretching of my personal tight areas and bringing fluid back into the joints by rotating all joints in circular motions. Quick and easy to do with minimal effort and start the day off correctly.

**During the day protocol:**

Never be in one position for more than one hour, that is the goal. I will be cycling the [active stretching trifecta](https://bell0bytes.eu/content/images/2019/02/20130809-200001.jpg) doing one of the mentioned active stretches every hour (or one of each three) My theory of why this is excellent is because when you sit (like me) for hours on end certain muscles in the body will essentially turn off (like my glutes) and certain muscles will become tight(like my hip flexors) so actively stretching and strengthening at the same time throughout the day makes sense. It shouldn't be so taxing on the body that you become sore. Just enough to wake up muscles and stretch muscles.

Also care should be taken to do things in “correct” posture throughout the day, think of the [Alexander Technique](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alexander-technique/)(also my name lol) Don't buy anything just watch YouTube videos and browse the web to gain knowledge.

Correct breathing habits too. [Correctly breathe](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-breathe#:~:text=Breathe%20in%20slowly%20through%20your,out%20without%20your%20chest%20moving.). There is some research about poor breathing habits affecting posture.

**Exercise protocol:**

**Strengthening of all major muscles** via the (RR) Recommended routine located on the sidebar.

**Strengthening of the Stabilizing muscles** and muscles missed in RR + other weak areas of the body. My personal posture routine with what I think are the best exercises for APT, RS,FHP

**Massaging tight areas in the body** in order to improve flexibility and efficient use of muscles

**Stretching and mobility** of tight areas in the body

My body works as a unit. So I will train everything in order to be balanced and strong.

So this is my plan. Hopefully it can be of help to other people also. I will be updating the spreadsheet if I find other useful things so feel free to check it every now and then. So far (50 days) I’ve made good improvements. Hopefully with this new routine and some solid dedication I can look like a bloody Greek god, :)

Also I’m no expert so if I've said something wrong please correct me, thanks. Also I will be posting a 6 months transformation. So in 4 months. To show that this works, I am confident.

It’s quite a hefty schedule, but I need to safely beat my body into submission. I got to say listen mothefucker this is how your body is supposed to be xd. Of Course if I start to feel off I will pull back a bit, I’m not that mental.

Marked NSFW. Just to be safe.

Much love to everyone on their own journey.

My Long Journey to 20 Pullups,searingmoment,824,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dcsf9p/my_long_journey_to_20_pullups/,1570116350.0,"A while back, after years and years of little upper body work, I decided that I wanted to do 20 pullups. Nice round number. Seemed goal-worthy. 20 was a former Marine Corps standard. So, I purchased a pullup bar. My starting max was 4-5 pullups. Thought I was in for a few-months of hard work to achieve my goal. Well, I finally got to 20 pullups with no hang rest. It took me almost 13 months.

For a little background info, I am about 6’, weigh 180-185, and >age 50. I probably started at about 25% body fat, and I am now probably at around 20%. Never have done dedicated pullup training in my life, so I didn’t have a lot of muscle memory. Many decades ago, I was a decent climber, but was probably 40 pounds lighter. Then, I can remember being able to do 12-14 without training them.

For the first month, I did almost exclusively pyramids -- usually just one pyramid. As I had experienced elbow tendonitis in the past, I was exceedingly careful about starting slowly. In fact, the one doubt I had about achieving the 20-pullup goal was being stopped by my elbows. My first workout, I believe (didn’t keep detailed records until after my first month or so), was a 1-2-3-2-1 pyramid. I would rest about 48 hours between workouts, I worked up to a max of a 1-7-1 pyramid, with 3-10 minutes between sets.
I took my first max test after about 1.5 months, and I got 13 pullups. Ahh, this wasn’t going to be too hard after all. A couple more months, and that box would be checked.

Nope.

Over the next 11.5 months, I:

• Did 147 workouts, totaling more than 9500 pullups/chin-ups, averaging about 65 pullups per workout

• Was injured only twice (minor elbow tendonitis), and my longest layoff period was 10 days.

I jumped around a fair bit, trying to find the magic program (spoiler: never did find it). My workout program went from:

• pyramids (max 1-7), • then Grease the Groove (GTG), consisting of 5s up to 7s, • Russian fighter program, • Every minute on minute (EMOMs) (weekly, for rest of duration of effort), • One month of weighted pullups, • GTG with other pullup types mixed in, such as Frenchies • A few weeks of Armstrong • A 10-day break, which appeared to help bust me out of a plateau • Maxing out on chins and pulls, with the chins leading my pullups and motivating me toward the final push to 20.

Pullups are hard (for many of us), especially if you’re not thin and wiry. The push to 20 was for me, the most protracted singular strength/endurance goal I can remember having and achieving. But I’m still not sure that I really even understand pullups all that well. There is a great thread on reddit fitness that asked how people got to 20 reps (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/akxsba/redditors_who_can_deadhang_20_pullups_how_did_you/) and it is amazing how many people achieved 20 in different and almost contradictory ways (weighted vs unweighted, and to failure/not are big opposing training camps). I did a lot of internet searching for tips to achieve 20 pullups, and appreciated threads that gave specific advice on how this goal was achieved. Therefore, I am putting down my tips in hopes that others will find them helpful. I am not claiming to be right on any of this, just explaining what seemed to work for me:

• Avoid Injury. This is probably the sagest thing I did. Although I wasn’t very diligent about warming up, I was hyper vigilant about monitoring my elbows, and would cut back quickly if I detected elbow twinges. The 3 biggest things for me in avoiding protracted elbow injury were: 1) doing much of my training on rings, 2) using a green Theraband whenever I felt elbow twinges, and 3) doing very light curls (all types). If you can keep training by avoiding injury, you are more likely to persevere and reach your goal.

• Don’t Avoid Training to Failure: A lot of controversy about training to failure, and my opinion is just one man’s view, but in my experience, you need to test your max often (at least a few times a week) in order to progress. 1-2 reps short of failure probably also works. When I changed to a GTG program, and only did about half-max reps and nothing close to failure, my max languished and regressed, despite averaging 70-80 pullups a day. When I started Armstrong (frequent pulling to failure), and then started testing my max regularly outside of the program, I busted out of a long plateau.

• EMOMs, Pyramids and Shortening Rest: I think EMOMs are really conducive to endurance gains. I started with 3s (did that first try), then 4s and 5s. I would do them for up to 30 minutes, and I try to do them once weekly. EMOMs and pyramids are the two workouts that I think were crucial in achieving 20 pullups. And, the one variable that doesn’t get nearly enough “airplay” in pullup discussions is rest period between sets. Armstrong is the one program that I’ve seen that touches on this. But, pyramids, with artfully programmed rep numbers and rest intervals, I think could get anyone to 20+.

• Do Chinups too: Chinups to me just feel easier, despite me only training them 5% of the time. But despite their perceived level of exertion, they only lead my pullups by about 10% in reps. I could almost always do chins painlessly when some ailment warned me against pullups, and they were a beacon of what could be when my pullups progression seemed hopeless. I got 20 chins a month ahead of my 20 pullups, and they were a reliable indicator of what was to come.

• Persistence: Never give in, never give up. Never stop never stopping.

This is way too long. Thanks to this sub, which I regularly lurked this past year. My next goal will be 25 pullups, and the ubergoal will be the one arm pullup. I think I will have to cut weight to have a shot at that one.

tl;dr Did 20 pullups. Took me 13 months. Tips: Avoid injury, EMOMs, Pyramids, Chinups, and training to failure seemed to work."
Increased my Pullups from 15 to 21 in 1 Month With Pavel's Routine (Edited),None,822,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/89ciyl/increased_my_pullups_from_15_to_21_in_1_month/,1522753371.0,"edit: Last post was removed as I posted my link, which I agree can be seen as advertising so if you would like to see evidence of reps feel free to message me and I can send you the link. Re posting this as I feel like it can benefit someone. 

The program itself: https://www.strongfirst.com/the-fighter-pullup-program-revisited/

Current stats: 5""11 , 185lb's, 23 years old.

Simply put the routine is 5 sets of rested pullups a day with a rest day on the 6th day. Rested meaning you can wait as much as you like in between sets just make sure you are fully recovered. The last set will increase, then the second to last set will increase the following day, so you are basically sneaking in reps into your sets for the day. For example my first 3 days were:

* Day 1 12, 10, 8, 6, 4
* Day 2 12, 10, 8, 6, 6
* Day 3 12, 10, 8, 8, 6

I managed a 40% increase on my pullups with this routine which I was pleased with as I could not find any results/progress diaries from anyone starting with 15 reps, was just hoping I could get to 20 (21st rep not so clean).

Some tips when attempting this routine: 

* Make sure recovery is on point (Sleeping as much as you need to feel rested) 

* Diet (try to stay as light as possible while eating enough to have the energy for your daily sets) 

* Manage your other training/life (I was also doing Antraniks routine, BJJ and have a 9-5 job so I would usually do 2 sets in the morning and 3 the in the evening while making sure I removed pullups from my Antranik routine days or just do 1 set during the workout. I would usually rest around an hour towards the end of the month when sets were getting pretty tough). 

* Embrace the suck. You're going to feel sore when doing a lot of reps regardless of how much rest you get. Don't be scared of over training, listen to your body as there is a difference to being sore and being over trained.

Let me know if you have any further questions about the routine. "

**UPDATE:** After a couple of questions I thought I would add some more context.  This fundraiser was actually part of a larger one that is run through the Nationwide Children's Hospital Marathon. My main driver for fundraising was running the half marathon and this was a fun way to hit my goal. I originally started running this race while my son was in the NICU 4 years ago. I was going through alot and needed an outlet. Never running more than a 5k before I trained for the full marathon in 9'ish weeks (it was probably the hardest thing I've ever done). Ever since then I have ran the Half in his honor.

The consensus was largely that trying to maintain muscle mass while on such a trip was impractical.

Well, i thought I'd give you a little overview of how it all went. In short: the people saying not to worry about strength loss were right. Hiking 8-14 hours a day for five months and experiencing all these amazing things on the way, it was very hard to care about working out. I ended up not worrying about my training at all while on the trail and, while i did experience pretty severe setbacks in my upper body strength because of it, i found that i could regain what i had lost shockingly fast after finishing the trail.

With pullups, for example, i went from a max of 11 reps @ 82 kg bw before the trail to 5 pullups @ 65 kg bw (yes, i lost 17 kg on the trail) immediately after the trail. However, less than 3 months after finishing the trail, i am back at just around 80 kg and i actually set a new personal best for pullups, 12 reps, just a few days ago.

I had an absolutely wonderful time on the PCT, being completely carefree and living in the moment. I thought it would take at least a year to recover from it, but the bodys ability to recover once you start working out again is much greater than i would have ever imagined! So i guess the lesson is this: if you're gonna go out on a grand adventure, let yourself be completely absorbed by it and don't worry too much about your workout regimen. You can always rebuild when you come home."
Advice about joints for people new to calisthenics,IcecreamJunkieUK,811,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fr2i8f/advice_about_joints_for_people_new_to_calisthenics/,1585469587.0,"TLDR: If you are new to callisthenics you are at risk of injuring your joints. The most at risk individual is someone who is older (30y+), with strong muscles from previous weight lifting, but tight and weak joints. It is best to start with progressions below what your muscles are capable while you work on joint strength/mobility exercises to allow your joints to ""catch up"".

I had a few years of weightlifting experience when I discovered calisthenics. I was immediately hooked  and went balls to the wall with the hardest progression I could using the RR. My expectation was that I would achieve a muscle up and a 30s handstand within a few months. Although I got close to both goals, I ended up with elbow, hand and wrist tendonitis so bad I couldn't even lift a kettle to make a cup of tea with my right arm due to the pain. It took 6 months of rehab exercises to regain full range of motion in my right wrist before I could cautiously start working out again.

I can now sense when my joints are unhappy and back off. If you get any sort of pinching or pain near a joint, you should stop doing exercises that aggravate it straight away.

It takes time to strengthen your joints and increase their range of motion. It also takes experience to judge how much and what type of mobility/stretching you should do to help your joints, without overdoing it.

Enjoy the journey."

Convict Conditioning: my perspective as a prior inmate.,ColdBoreShooter,813,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ej7etw/convict_conditioning_my_perspective_as_a_prior/,1578012522.0,"Before CC I was the definition of sedentary. No exercise regimen to speak of. I was practicing time-restricted eating and attempting a plant-based diet (poorly), but the path I was on was going to lead to a shorter lifespan and I knew I had to change something. I'd had bouts of attempting to get in shape; meager gym appearances, buying a stationary bike, the usual shit. But what I was missing was a program that I could latch onto and believe in. My 25-year-old metabolism was keeping me in check, but I knew that wasn't sustainable. 

&#x200B;

In May of 2019, someone who knew I was going to jail for 3 months (first and last time, folks) recommended I get CC sent in for me after I got situated. He said it's a great way to get stronger when you don't have access to equipment and you're in a confined space. I didn't think much of it and half-heartedly asked my folks to order it once I was inside. Quick note: I know 3 months in county jail isn't shit. The only reason that's relevant is because the book is geared towards people who are incarcerated or aspire to be ""prisoner-fit,"" and I'm not claiming that my time even comes close to rivaling what others have had to go through. It was rough, though. I honestly don't think I could have kept my sanity as well as I did without CC.

&#x200B;

The first few days I was there without a program, I was doing the same dumb shit that everyone else was: endless burpees until you want to puke, hundreds of frantic pushups every consecutive day with horrible form, momentum-heavy dip station work, running in place until your calves don't work anymore, you name it. No one knew what the fuck they were doing, but they all acted like they did. Some were ripped, some were chubbier than me, but I didn't trust anyone. I tried to keep up with the high intensity shit they would do in the workout area but quickly became demoralized when I was incredibly sore every day and could barely walk around. With the shitty diet in there, even if you're sweating buckets after a workout, you'll still be a fat fuck, and I witnessed that constantly. I knew that doing close to 1,000 rushed half-pushups a day couldn't possibly be the way to go. 

&#x200B;

Then I got the book in June, and I started reading. Everything Paul Wade (or ""the author,"" to be less controversial on here) said made logical sense about the advantages of progressive, low-set bodyweight training over alternatives, and I decided to commit 100% to the program. I was literally at rock bottom in my life and needed something to latch onto. I'm not religious or dogmatic, but I think it was only natural to be searching for something to give me hope at that point. I broke away from the dorm's mindless group exercises and started doing my own thing, starting at Step 1 of 10 for each of The Big Six movements. I decided to follow the Veterano program, impatient to get started and wanting to build muscle and strength with the time I had there. Veterano is an ""intermediate"" program where you do one movement a day for 2-3 sets, 6 days a week. The order outlined in the book for maximum recovery, starting on Monday, was Pull-ups, Bridges, Handstand Pushups, Leg Raises, Squats, and Pushups. I could immediately tell that this program was going to keep me busy for years. I wrote in my workout journal every day, documenting my progress and giving me a goal for the next week. I made a major effort to time protein consumption to maximize muscle growth. By the end of my short time there (didn't feel short at the time, perspective's a bitch), my new inmate buddies were commenting that I looked significantly better than when I showed up. Upon release my family, friends and girlfriend echoed those remarks. 

&#x200B;

I took and have continued to take a ""fundamentalist"" approach to the book, which seems to conflict with advice given here: I have not modified any of the exercises or rep requirements. I want to follow the program as long as I possibly can, waiting until I plateau on all 6 movements before switching over to your Recommended Routine or something similar. I believe it's important to not bounce around whenever you discover a new program, and I'm grateful for CC's author giving me a workable, spoon-feedy regimen for a noob like me. It was exactly what I needed to have the motivation to get off my ass and work on myself physically. 

&#x200B;

I do not have any before or after stats, but I've still kept the weight off from before I went in and notice a leaner build when I look in the mirror. Muscle mass seems to have increased for upper body, and girlfriend agrees. For those who think calisthenics may contribute to lean muscle mass and reduction in body fat, I was probably over 20% before I started CC and I'm currently hovering around 18.5% according to my scale. Goal is 15% by EOY. Currently my abilities are as follows: 

&#x200B;

\-3 sets of 20 Horizontal Pulls (Rows). Progression Standard is 3x30. These are only Step 2 of the series and have been plaguing me since June. But I have noticed an increase in my endurance. It's much easier to set a pull-up bar at hip-height in my doorway then attempt these under a table; if you want to call that a modification, that's what I've been doing since my release, and it's helped increase my reps. I am hell-bent on making that progression standard. I know that's very high for this sub, but the author makes some convincing arguments for the benefits of high-rep work before moving to a harder exercise in the CC Super FAQ. Once I hit that standard, I'll never have to do that many reps again in the Pull-up progression. 

&#x200B;

\-2 sets of 16 bridges down a wall, and then back up. Not as fast as typical reps due to super-high heart rate, but I do them as quickly as I can while keeping track of reps in my journal. Next step is bending back into a bridge from a standing position, and will require exponentially more flexibility then I currently have. I plan to fix this by making my bridges more compact, forcing my back to bend more while keeping my arms and legs as straight as possible. 

&#x200B;

\-110 second wall handstand. Progression Standard is 2 minutes. This has been frustrating since I've been attempting this since June. I do not want to give up and move onto half-handstand pushups; I am confident that with enough time, I can build up enough muscle and circulation strength to make it happen. When I start doing handstand pushups, I will have a very strong foundation against the wall. 

&#x200B;

\-3 sets of 25 flat bent leg raises (on your back). Progression Standard is 3x30. These are painful but I've seen marked improvements in core strength over time. Next exercise is Flat Frog Raises. 

&#x200B;

\-2 sets of 20 Close Squats (heels together). Every week I attempt the infamous Uneven Squat, every week I fail. I'll admit that I've gotten so frustrated with it that I've tried doing unassisted pistol squats instead, unsuccessfully. I'm going to take the author's advice and try Unevens using a static object instead of a basketball, and then try hitting the Progression Standard with a basketball eventually. This has been frustrating, but I'm not giving up and the Close Squats have been getting a little easier over time since I do them each Friday that I fail to progress. 

&#x200B;

\-2 sets of Close Pushups (Diamonds). Progression Standard is 2x20. I recently hit 2x20 Full (Classic) Pushups, and the reason it took so long was that I've been doing them slow and excruciatingly as described in the book. I was stuck on girl pushups for the better part of 5 months. But I'm glad, because my patience is wearing off. I am confident that I will be able to do 2x20 soon, and then the one-arm variants will start. It's easy to claim that you can do so many hundred pushups in one setting; trust me, I knew a lot of those guys last summer. But when you really look at those bouncing, joint-killing abominations that people call ""pushups,"" it's easy to see where those bloated numbers are coming from. I'll tell you, 2 sets of 20 Full Pushups, at a strength-oriented speed, was fucking HARD for me. 

&#x200B;

I'm not going to claim that this is the best bodyweight system ever devised; I don't even begin to have enough knowledge to say that. There are movements that have been plaguing me, and it can be frustrating. But I know that I am getting stronger. I can see it, and the results speak for themselves. I am nowhere near where I want to be, but it's clear to me that progress is being made. If there's a point where I literally can't progress on anything anymore, I'll reevaluate and see what all the cool kids are doing. But currently, this works for me. I love the way everything is set up. I know when to do each exercise, I know when I can progress, and I have tangible goals. Who the fuck knows man, maybe I'll be the first guy ever to legitimately document consistent One-Arm Handstand Pushups. Highly unlikely, but it's a fun goal to have.  

&#x200B;

I have CC 2 as well, and once I finish my current book I plan on reading it so I can incorporate the full CC lifestyle, which apparently includes aspects of my workout that are sorely lacking like cardio and stretching. If CC can give me workable versions of those as well, I will feel even more confident in what I'm doing. My goal is long term cardiovascular health as well as muscle, tendon and joint health. I wanna live forever! 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm sorry for the long post. I've been meaning to share my experience with the sub for a while and had some down time at work today, so fuck it. It hasn't even been a year yet so I don't think it's fair to make any serious judgements on the program, but if I'm even improving in one movement I consider it working as of now. Thank you for reading and I'd love to hear about your experiences with CC. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Experimented with CC during a brief stint in county jail about 6 months ago. Found that I really liked it and have continued using it. Have seen and felt gains in strength and endurance during this short time and want to continue the program. Enjoy the structure."
"When ""Just get started"" feels like ""Just do this impossibly difficult thing that you've been bashing your head into the invisible wall trying to do for a long time now""",stickysweetastytreat,810,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ek0j4h/when_just_get_started_feels_like_just_do_this/,1578163405.0,"I posted this in r/selfimprovement & got (am still getting!) a great response. Fitness goals are especially popular this time of year & I know this sub recognizes that, so I hope this can help someone who is overwhelmed with the process, get a different perspective. Also, know that there is always help out there for you!

&#x200B;

If you're in a cycle of trying, failing, beating yourself up, trying to try harder, feeling like deer-in-headlights, starting to try again.. I wrote this for you. I hope this perspective can help someone, especially if you've been stuck trying to get going on some self-improvement goals!

**If people keep saying to you ""just need to start"", ""just take that first  step"" and it isn't helping you, there's nothing wrong with you.**

I was 210 lbs when I first started training aerial arts. Literally obese for my height, 5’4”. I had to go through a few coaches who weren’t just willing to work with me, but also understood where I was starting from so that they *could* work with me. Someone who didn’t say patronizing shit like:

*\*Just\* do a pull-up and then go from there.*

*\*Just\* start by hauling your ass over your head while you’re hanging from your arms.*

*\*Just\* grab your foot behind your head and then you’ll be done!*

I’m sitting here like, *Are you fucking serious? How is that a “just”??* I couldn’t even hang for more than 10 seconds, do a full set of sit-ups, hold a plank, etc. It made me feel like I was lacking. I mean, I already did feel like I was lacking, so hearing that *\*just\**, only proved my beliefs. Like, *fuck! That’s how far I am.. ughh.*

*\*Just\** can be so condescending! Sure, that kind of encouragement works for some people, but what if you’re in the camp that it *doesn’t* help? You only need to hear it a few times to know it's not changing anything for you.

*\*Just\* get started. \*Just\* take that first step.* It might as well be ""*Have you tried trying?*""^(… I get that you’re trying to help, but it’s not helping. Thanks for trying, I know you mean well.)

I mean, if “just get started” worked, you wouldn’t be stuck here anymore. First off, know that the *\*just\** **does** **not** speak to where you’re at. We all start somewhere, and that’s that-- there are no more extrapolations to be made from that. The *\*just\** **does** speaks to that person’s inability to grasp the distance that you’re getting ready to cross. It’s not necessarily their fault though..  sometimes, things just don’t work out together. Sometimes, perspectives clash.

**There's a difference between ""too attached to your comfort zone"" and ""playing it safe in a tough situation""**

Sometimes, people say you don’t want to change because you’re too attached to your comfort zone. That’s just like the issue with *\*just\**. “Comfort” is relative.

Let’s say you’re out gambling. You’ve lost a bunch at this point. You have a little bit left, barely enough to cover the ride home. Do you stay and try your luck? Do you call it good and head home? That’s a hard call to make!

Now, what if it’s not your ride home that’s at stake? What if it’s your pet, or a family heirloom, or the one thing that your job hinges on? That’s an even harder call to make! You’d probably be more conservative because there's more to lose. It’s safer to keep this thing, than to potentially lose it all.

What if, instead of your ride home, your pet or heirloom, it’s your **self**? I don’t even need to ask; I know you’re going to take the safe option. I took the safe option when this choice was in my face. I fully believe we are biologically wired to take what we believe is the safest, lowest-risk option. We might not understand all of our inclinations, but our brains are always running simulations in the background, testing theories, scanning the environment for danger. It’s the job of your  nervous system to watch out for you. After all, if a car swerves at you, you jump aside before you realize it. If someone makes a loud noise, you startle by reflex. If someone throws something at you, you flinch.

When you’re already in a compromised position, weighing the pro’s and con’s has more weight to it, because there’s more at stake. Going from a 10 to a 7 means you're still above the midpoint; it isn’t nearly as bad as going from a 5 to 2. These choices we’re faced with can feel like you’re being forced to gamble with the *highest* stakes that matter to you.

**Being in this position takes its toll. You’re not “lazy” for being stuck here.**

In the muffled distance, you know you need to make the gamble at some point because you *do* want to come out that end, badly. But that risk is still there-- you could lose what little you have left. If you’re in that headspace, there’s a good chance you’re paralyzed in that indecision. It’s less  “I’m too comfy in my comfort zone wahhh” and more “If this doesn’t work out, I’m going to be even worse off, and this is terrible enough.” Totally understandable to be frozen because you’re choosing between two shitty things-- and how long can you fight in place until you’re running on fumes? Maybe you already are!

People might look at you and say you’re being lazy or \**just\** not trying hard enough. Maybe that’s true, or maybe it just *looks* like that to outsiders. Maybe you’re fighting exhaustion, numbness, fear… it might as well be quicksand. People don’t usually see this part of the struggle because they don’t want to or they can’t. Over time, you learn to be quiet. Maybe you shut yourself away, even from yourself.

How can you even begin to fight back?

**What else is there, if it's not ""\*just\* get started""?**

So that’s it? You *\*just\** have to suck it up and take the plunge? Some people think so; I used to. Until one day, that didn’t work out my way. I got help and I learned another way. You can’t change the reality of your situation, but you **can** change your approach.

I think modern-day society has built up this idea of “go big or go home”, “get some skin in the game”, “take the plunge”, “rip the band-aid off”. It makes us feel like the only way we could possibly bring change, is to jump ALL IN. The more terrifying, the shittier the risks, the better!?? But come on-- when was the last time you were able to perform when you were flat out terrified and running on fumes? Does that actually make sense?

I’m guessing you’ve tried the brute strength method-- trying to compel yourself one way or another, to “get your shit together”. How many times have you woken up and played the drill sergeant in your head, or gone to bed regretting that you failed yourself yet again?

**If strong isn’t working for you anymore, go for smart.**

If you’ve been trying this brute-force way over and over again and it’s not working, what if you tried the opposite way?

***How can you re-frame your next choice so that it isn’t a high-stakes gamble?***

What is the smallest increment you can break down from that goal you want? Think small, not big. What’s one thing you could accomplish in one moment? And don’t go by what other people tell you to do. You got this--  you are smart, capable of critical thinking-- you can figure that out. Something so small that you’re going to be like “That’s it? That’s not bad”.

* Maybe tonight while you’re on your third hour of YouTube, the thought might occur to you “I can go without watching this next thing.”
* Maybe tomorrow morning when you’re rushing out the door, you might think “I can grab a bar and eat half of it instead of skipping breakfast.”
* Maybe this weekend when you start feeling a bit sleepy, you decide “I’m going  to bed. My body is telling me that I’m tired, it’s late enough, I’m not going to force myself to stay up.”
* Maybe next week when you’re grocery shopping, you realize that you always grab that bag of chips, but you’re a tiny bit curious how crispy  cucumber slices would go with hummus.

This is how you build trust in yourself. If there’s trust paving the way, you won’t feel like you’re taking a huge risk. It’s not a gamble anymore; it’s growth. But you have to work your way there; you wouldn’t put your trust in something that hasn’t been tested, right?

**What if you still make the “wrong” choice?**

Let’s say you do choose to stay on YouTube, you skip breakfast, you stay up a little more, you get the bag of chips. The thing is, you didn’t “fail” even if you didn’t make the “better” choice. Why? Because you brought your attention to the break in the road, and made a *conscious* choice instead of retreating back into the flow of passive automation. Even if your conscious choice was “fuck it”-- as long as you recognize that you’re **making** that choice, it still counts. You still came up for air. It’s the difference between “I want A, not B or C” vs it never even occurring to you. Accumulating these conscious moments takes practice but the good news is that this **is** the work.

When you’ve accumulated some extra breathing room, maybe you start taking a step that’s a tiny bit further out. Just a bit, not so far that it feels like a gamble, or that you’re questioning your trust in yourself. As you continue this work, you’ll get better at figuring out your next step. Trust that making conscious choices means that you’re always moving towards your values.

When you make a conscious choice, it means that you were engaged. You checked in enough to see what you were *actually* feeling in the moment instead of going through the motions with eyes and ears shut until that moment passed.

Can you see what you can build with this?? Each conscious choice is a moment of value you’ve created. One day when you look at the sum of all these moments that you’ve built, you’ll see that you’ve embodied the ideas of exactly who you wanted to be.

r/bwf **followup--** 

Here are some reminders--

* It's ok to ask for help, and it's ok to seek help in a new field that is best-equipped to help you.
* You don't *have to* start a workout program, or even RR, if your goal is general health.
* You don't have to finish the workout if you feel like you're dying (whether it's your first workout or your 1000th-- learn to listen to your body by practicing it!).
* It's not the end of the world if you miss a workout or eat wrong. Even if you get distracted for some time.. going on vacation, rehabbing an injury, getting sick, etc-- if fitness is a *lifestyle* goal, that means part of the training is in working with your perspective to be ok with the ebbs & flows of life.
* Check your perspective. Do you get yourself worked up over having to commit to fitness? Well, do you get yourself worked up over ""omg I have to brush my teeth & shower FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE??"" I'm sure you do other things every day that aren't like, SO AWESOME, but you don't view it as all of it added up!
* There's no value in placing negative judgement on the fact that you have to regress an exercise, work on flexibility/mobility more, or go to physical therapy. You are the one that defines your values; you will go farther in the long run if you work to address the level you're at now."
Do you get high (or just feel amazing) from working out?

Context:Have a friend I'm walking once a week. He abhors physical exercise, gets physically ill if his BPM rises above 140 or so. On the other hand, I get an easy high from workouts, both strength and cardio. Looking to find a way for him to enjoy it as well.More info about the highs - I get a mellow euphoria from strength workout, even a minute of low star plank gives me a dose. From cardio I get a longer, more intense high after about 30 minutes of 80-90% BPM, on top of the mellow euphoria. This one lasts for a few hours.

Thank you, and apologies if this is a stupid and/or common question. I don't have anyone IRL to discuss this with, and my ignorance of the subject is deep enough to cause thalassophobia.  


\[EDIT\]

Thank you for all the answers, people, you're awesome!

**Findings:**  


* Apparently, a sizeable percentage of people never get high from exercise
* Among the people who do, there seems to be a spectrum of 
   * how easy is the high to trigger (specificity of conditions)
   * the intensity of the high
   * the duration of the high
* Among the people who do, main factors for triggering the high seem to be 
   * a specific balance of strength/cardio intensity
   * a specific state of mind
* For some, the high can be optimized via
   * workout environment
   * exercise intensity balance
   * optimizing nutrition

This shi- is ego-shatteringly humbling. Discussion/thoughts. Advice if you're feeling generous.,Broggernaut,808,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/og5d3j/this_shi_is_egoshatteringly_humbling/,1625744042.0,"I consider myself a pretty strong dude. Military for almost 20 years, competitive power-lifter, 10+ years of dedicated gym-based weight training. 6'1, 230lbs, just under 14% bodyfat as of my last DXA scan \~6 months ago. Not intended to be a flex, but just explaining that I'm in really good shape - or so I thought. Back surgery a while ago made super heavy deads and squats just not my peak interest anymore and since they were my absolute favorite exercises my gym time feels unsatisfying without them. Because of this I recently decided I wanted to transition to a bodyweight fitness focus because it's new and it's been a low buzz in the back of my head to eventually try for the past few years.

I figured with my history and strength levels that traditionally aggressive goals were more reasonable for me so I decided on the following as my goals:

* clean muscle ups
* planche & planche pushups
* handstand and handstand pushups eventually moving to pike HS 
* front lever

Well, I like routines so I decided to go with the ThenX app because I have no idea how to form a workout around exercises that don't involve heavy compound lifts. 

I super-setted his BEGINNER handstand routine with his BEGINNER muscle-up reqs and i am more exhausted than any 4+ plate bench session has left me in years. I'm also now acutely aware of how poorly raw strength translates into functional strength. Not to mention flexibility is now an insane issue. my ""pike"" probably looks like someone tipped a carpenter's square over. Doing a handstand left my shoulders so far in front of my body it's probably comical.

It's insane to me because I've been doing pushups, situps, pullups, etc. for years. I'm still positive that I'll get to where I want to be, but it was just a humbling first experience.

At 40 I was a bodyweight only guy that worked out 6-7 days a week and able to do many of the cool tricks like planche and muscle ups. I did Hot Yoga 3-4x a week and then COVID hit.

During COVID I was outta work and started lifting twice a day 3x a week and got pretty big at 42 but then after about 9 months I hurt myself. During the time of lifting I started eating more to bulk up and continued to eat more even after my injury and subsequent reduced training.

I've been lifting and running daily all along with no real goals and just floundering.

I've relented and am going to go back to bodyweight only along with an arduous stretching routine.

I tried them two and a half months ago and fell in love: you get a pump and you get a runner's high.

Since then I've done 100 different burpees four to five times a week. (You can find many different variations on youtube). In the beginning it took me about 40 minutes. Today I can do such a workout in 25 minutes, which makes me very proud.

In the meantime, I have found some people in my circle of friends who have tried this and have integrated it into their own routine. Therefore, I can only recommend passionate athletes to try it out.

Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2t18hi/to_everyone_doing_a_pushupsquatplankwhatever/) about high repetition plank/push-up/squad challenges from the FAQ:

>  If you're looking to get into exercising, you typically have some kind of goals like ""look better naked"" or ""get stronger"". While these challenges might influence your body composition a little, there are much better ways to go about changing that. 

> There is a certain injury risk associated with this kind of challenge.

The advantage over plank/push-up/squad challenges: You have a more hollistic workout if you do burpees. Make sure that you have variances in your workouts."

##**Initial motivation**

---
I always wanted to go to the gym. I was weak and quite underweight. I could only do a few pushups and only one proper pullup. I browsed /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding a lot but never really got around to it. There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive €38 per month without a free weight area.

----
##**Training**

---
I started off doing bodyweight training only. My town did not have any fitness parks to workout at. Instead I used different school playgrounds as my main workout area. As the exercises became easier I either added weight through a backpack full of boring school books or moved on to a harder progression which you can see below.


Exercise | Before | After |
-------- | ------ | ----- |
Pullups	| 1x	| 3x7 +5kg (+12kg bw) |
Dips	| 2x	| 3x10 +8kg (+12kg bw) |
Rows	| 3x4	| 3x10 one arm incline rows |
Pushups	| 3x5	| 3x12 +20kg	|
Squats	| 3x12	| 3x8 +10kg single leg squats|
Lunges	| 3x8	| 5x20 +40kg |
Abs	| 30 sec plank	| 3x10 hanging leg raises|
Sprints | 5x40m | 10x90m	|

######Basic Workout Breakdown:


This is a basic example of what my average workout looked like. Some days I'll sub in different exercises, but this will give you a good starting point. For example once I got to 15 reps on pushups for 3 sets I either added weight through a backpack or moved onto diamond pushups.


Workout A| Workout B| Workout C |
--------- | --------- | --------- |
Pullups 3x5-10| Dips 4x5-10 | Wide Pullups 3x5-10
Dips 3x5-10| Chinups 4x5-10  | Dips 3x5-10
Rows 3x8-15| Weighted Pushups 4x5-10| Rows 5x8-15
Pushups 3x8-15| Pause Rows 4x5-10| Pushups 5x8-15
Squats 3x15-20 | Leg Raises 4x10-15| Squat Jumps 3x5
Walking Lunges 3x15-20 | Hill Sprints 50m x8| Lunges 5x15-20

---
##**Diet**

---
I usually eat whatever I want and I make sure to get enough calories and protein at the end of the day. But I know people on r/fitness always want the full package so below is an example of what my diet looks like on a school day.


Meal | Example |Calories| Protein | 
--------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | 
Breakfast | 3 Scrambled eggs, turkey ham, oatmeal and a glass of milk| 850 | 39 |
Lunch | 6 Sandwiches: 2x cheese, 2x PB, 2x ham and a glass of milk | 1050 | 34 |
Dinner | Ground beef with potatoes and veggies | 700 | 30 |
Snack | Bowl of quark, a banana and a handful of walnuts | 400 | 27 |

---
##**Supplements**

---
I didnt take protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, etc. Simply because I could not afford it. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are:


+ Vitamin C
* Vitamin D


I feel like that's all I need for now. As my budget increases, I might consider experimenting with taking other supplements.

---
##**Sleep**

---
I know and feel sleep is important. School requires me to get up at 06:30. This is why I am in bed 22:30 Sunday to Friday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend.

---
##**Habits**

---
I now workout three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I can't remember a moment in my life dedicating to something and being consistent with it before I started fitness.


I also wake up and go to bed at the same time almost every day. Before I would wake up one day at 10 am and go to bed at 2 am.


Last but not least I changed my way of eating from around barely 1300 calories a day to 3000 a day which was necessary for the gainz to be made.

---
##**Conclusion**

---
Starting to workout has been the best decision in my life so far. I have changed my habits and I have probably laid a good foundation for the rest of my fitness and life journey. I am feeling much happier and more productive in general.


Training wise I came to the conclusion that weighted work is much easier to program progressive overload allowing you to see more consistent gains. Due my dedication my brother bought me a gym membership. The past weeks I started with barbell squats and deadlifts. I missed out on so much ~~fun~~ leg gainz.


**Edit**: The reason I did not include straight arm work was because I didn't had not studied it properly and was afraid to injure myself. Now I have read up on the progressions, I will include them in my training. I'd like to achieve a front lever by the end of 2017.

[PROGRESS] 1 year recommended routine [M23/6'0/~162],dorbay,796,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/enn869/progress_1_year_recommended_routine_m2360162/,1578834348.0,"Lately I have seen a lot of questions asking what progress you can expect from following the recommended routine (maybe because it´s January).

So today i went through my photos and videos and realized i got some pictures of me from exactly one year ago. I downloaded the bodyweight fitness app at the end of January last year and started the recommended Routine the same day.

After taking some ""after"" pictures and comparing them for myself i thought: why not share them.

So here is my form right now and progress pictures compared to last year, added some clothed one as well i felt like i could see the size difference more with those. 

 [https://imgur.com/a/gdTma7i](https://imgur.com/a/gdTma7i) 

For reference: Right now i have 163 workouts logged and if i keep up until the end of January i will hit 169 this year, or in other words one workout every 52 hours compared to one workout every 48 hours as recommended. 

My starting weight last year was around 148 pounds and I am around 162 pounds right now. Half way through the year i think i should have been eating more as i was not gaining much weight and the last month and a half i overate maybe a little, I was a good bit leaner 2 month back. 

\[Disclaimer\]: Looking at the photos i´m sure you could not tell but before i started RR i was working out in a gym for about 3 month (stopped in January last year and took the ""before"" pictures then) and even before going to the gym i used an app called YAYOG for quite some time but looking back now I would not call what i did then working out. I probably ate way to little back then as well and was skinnyfat ( I was not able to do one push up at \~20 years).

&#x200B;

Routine i followed:

As i said before i still follow the plan laid out in the Bodyweight Fitness app (recommended routine) but over time i changed some elements to my own preference.

After archiving 3x8 pullups i started doing weighted pull ups.

After archiving 3x8 ring dips i started doing weighted ring dips.

After  archiving 3x8 Deep Step-up i started doing pistol squads and assisted pistol squads.

Instead of Plank im doing hanging tucked leg raises. 

&#x200B;

Results so far:

I am not too crazy about skills at the moment and am focusing on gaining some more muscles first.

L-sit on floor: \~10 sec

Handstand: \~ 5 sec (only did it every workout for 2 minutes, i have got some weird elbow pain going on there)

Ring muscle up (tried it, got a good one and have not trained it further)

Ring turned out push up: \~6

Weighted pull up: \~6 with 18 pounds added (still trying to perfect form, i think i finally got it)

Weighted ring dips: 5 with 28 pound added

pistol squads: \~8 with some assistance

Tuck ice Cream Maker: 6

&#x200B;

I hope i could give some insights, I can only recommend using the recommended routine. For me it worked out way better then going to the gym or using the YAYOG app.

Oh and i use rings for every exercise no pull up bar."
Body weight DOES translate to lifting gains,Leaningblocks,800,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/t1zsfj/body_weight_does_translate_to_lifting_gains/,1645889846.0,"I do 300 push ups, 300 squats and 150 pull ups a day. Today I decided to try some deadlifting for the first time in many months. Seriously haven’t touched a barbell in 4 months and even then it was squats not dl’s.

Well I pulled 335 like cake so I said f it I’m going to 385. 

I pulled 385 which TIES my PR from when I used to lift heavy a lot.

I’ll be interested to see how it translates to my bench press, military press and bent over rows.

I’m 5’7” 165 male, also just tied my heaviest weight but my body fat is way lower than back then so gain train is rolling baby.

Ten of the Best Calisthenics Leg Exercises to Build Strength and Gain Mass,berimbolosforsatan,797,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/tdtex9/ten_of_the_best_calisthenics_leg_exercises_to/,1647249767.0,"tl;dr https://youtu.be/6VFtueRlafc
It's common to hear that you can't train legs using calisthenics alone, but that is simply not true. I will admit that it is simpler to progressively overload traditional exercises like squats, lunges and deadlifts, you simply add more weight. With calisthenics, we have to get creative, because the only thing we can use to create resistance is the positioning of our own body. 

The next argument is that because of this limitation in loading, the resistance is not high enough to induce hypertrophy, or muscle growth. Well, research by Schoenfeld et al. conducted a systematic review of the literature to compare changes in strength and hypertrophy between high and low load resistance training, and found that across the included studies, muscle hypertrophy can be equally achieved across a spectrum of loading ranges, and ""The findings therefore indicate that both heavy and light loads can be equally effective in promoting muscle growth provided training is carried out with a high level of effort. ""(https://journals.lww.com/nscajscr/Fulltext/2017/12000/Strength_and_Hypertrophy_Adaptations_Between_Low_.31.aspx)

. In other words, when done correctly, low load resistance training is just as effective at building muscle as high load training. 

So this means as long as we can put resistance on the working muscle to be able to work it hard enough to get close to failure, we are able to induce hypertrophy!
The next question is how to get enough tension in the muscles, so here is 10 of the best calisthenics leg exercises which will hit every major muscle group below the waist!



##Pistol Squat,
First up is the pistol squat, because when you think of calisthenics leg exercises, one of the first ones you'll think of is the pistol squat. The pistol squat is a great leg exercise and is challenging enough to be a goal for a lot of people. I have a full video describing in detail how to get your first pistol squat if you want to check that out. But to do a pistol squat, extend one leg out in front of you and lower yourself into the squat as far as you can.  Try to limit any wobbling at the knee. Doing so will help engage the glute medius and unlock the balance gains found in the pistol squat. The pistol is great because it tests your balance and is great for overloading the quads.

##Reverse Hyper
The reverse hyper is a great way of training the glutes, as well as the hip extension capabilities of the hamstrings. Hip extension is a very important movement to be training, because not a lot of calisthenics movement train this To perform a reverse hyper, you will need a chair or ledge, and place the crease of your hips right over the edge of the chair. Extend your legs behind you feeling a contraction in your glutes and hamstrings. Make sure you are not arching your lower back or using mometum, control the movement at all points to make sure it's the glutes and hamstrings doing the work. You can regress the movement by bending your legs, and progress the movement by extending your legs further behind you.

##Single Leg Calf Raise.
For complete leg development, you simply cannot skip the calves. The single leg calf raise is easy to do, all we need to do is fine a ledge to hang our heel over, cross our leg behind us and plantar flex the foot, or raise up on our toes, getting a contraction at the top. It is especially important when training calves to not use momentum, because the calves insert via the achilles tendon which is the largest tendon in your body and it's job is to transfer elastic energy to your foot so walking is easy, so if we let the achilles tendon get involved, the calf muscles are going to be getting minimal work. This means every single rep should have a minimum one second pause at the bottom, and should be done at a very slow pace to make sure it is actually your calves doing the work and not the slingshot effect of your achilles tendon. 

##Reverse Nordic
I have already made a full video about the reverse nordic and why everbody, calisthenics or not should be doing this exercise, wwhich is linked here: for those that have not seen it, the reverse nordic is a fantastic way of training rectus femoris, one of your quads, in particular. Rectus femoris is not as active as your other quads in other movements like squats and lunges, because it is shortened due to the hip flexion in these exercises, so can not contract optimally. To target the rec fem directly, we need to keep the hip extended as whe extend the knee under load, which is exactly what the reverse nordic is doing. Begin kneeling on the floor and keeping the hips extended lower your upper body towards the floor. If you are new to reverse nordics, I highly suggest putting something behind you to catch you if you fall, because if you fail you are falling to the end range of knee flexion under load, and that is the perfect storm for injury.

##Nordic Curl
The regular nordic curl is a great way of training knee flexion using your body weight. The problem? It is incredibly difficult and requires a lot of strength.  To get around that, you can again restrict the range and gradually increase it over time. Resistance bands are also a great way to progress through this exercise, but not everyone has access to those - so the other way to regress the movement is to simply restrict the range of motion. A nordic curl involves anchoring your feet under something and maintaining extended hips as you lower your body down by extending the knee. You don't need a dedicated nordic bench, there are a number of options you can use to do nordics, including a barbell, a partner , a bench and lifting strap, even your car!

##Copenhagen Plank
The copenhagen plank is a great way increasing strength in the adductors, or groin muscles and has been shown to reduce groin injury rates by 41% in football players when  included in a strength and conditioning program. To perform a copenhagen plank, place one foot on a chair or bench whilst supporting yourself on your elbow. From here raise your hips up by pushing the top foot down by contracting the adductors. Raise yourself up until your hips reach neutral, and lower yourself back down under control. To decrease the difficulty you can bend the top leg so less of your body has to be moved, and you can also hold the plank and use it to develop isometric strength.

##Shrimp Squat
Even though this is a single leg squat, it is much harder to get a full range of motion on this than it is on the pistol squat. The shrimp squat involves holding one leg behind you whilst you bend the front leg and try to lower your knee all the way down to the floor. This is hard enough to get full range of motion in the standard version, but if you're a machine, you can make it even harder by increasing the range of motion by starting on an elevated surface.

##Touchdown Squat
The touchdown squat is a great exercise for correcting any single leg strength discrepancies, or improving your balance on one leg at all points of a squat. It often appears in corrective routines because of this, but it is a great leg exercise in its own right and those benefits just come as a bonus! To do a touchdown squat, you need to start on an elevated surface. What we are trying to do is keep the squat pattern the same at the hips, despite doing it on one leg. Have the free leg extended straight down, and we are going to squat on the support leg by pushing our hips back and lowering our foot towards the floor, and lightly touch the foot on the ground, and return to the starting position. The key is to only use a height such that you are able to control the squat at all times. Over time, both your strength and balance will improve and you will be able to go deeper!

##Single leg RDL
The single leg RDL can be thought of as the hip extension version of the touchdown squat. By that I mean it is great for training your balance and single leg hip extension strength. Technique is key to for this exercise, again, we want this to look just like the double leg version, at the working hip at least. Start with a slight bend in one leg and the other off the ground, with full extension at the knee. we are going to hinge forward on the support leg by pushing our hips backward, which will bring our upper body forwards. At the bottom, there should be a straight line from your head, all the way to your foot. To achieve this, don't let your upper body collapse, or let your back leg flop about behind you. Full body tension is the key here. Another common mistake we want to avoid is to prevent the non working leg from rotating around as we progress into the movement. Make sure the toes of the back foot are pointing straight down to the floor at all times.

##Single leg glute bridge
And lastly, we arrive at the glutes, and  glute max specifically, which is the largest muscle in your body and must be worked for complete leg development it cannot be missed . The single leg is a simple exercise, so that means to get the best out of it, the subtleties matter. Begin laying down with your upper back supported on something like a chair or bench. The foot placement matters, we want to bring the foot in so the knee angle is less than 90° so the hamstrings are shortened in this position. The hamstrings can also extend the hip as well as the glutes, so by putting them in a shortened position we are diminishing their ability to contribute to the movement. Make sure not to arch the lower back, that's a surefire way to trick yourself into thinking you're getting the full range of motion. Flex at the non working hip to stack the weight of the leg right over the working muscles, and keep your abs engaged the entire time.

So there you go, hopefully this settles the debate that you can't train legs by doing calisthenics alone.  10 of the best calisthenics leg exercises that you can start doing to build strength and gain muscle!

"My 10 Minute Routine for Strong, Stable Shoulders!",berimbolosforsatan,792,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/q26fwc/my_10_minute_routine_for_strong_stable_shoulders/,1633470505.0,"The shoulder is one of the most mobile joints in our body, but that comes at the cost of stability. With so much movement, there is a lot that can go wrong. 

The position and control of the shoulder blades on the thorax play a critical role in normal function of the shoulder. The movement of your shoulder blades help align your shoulder joint to create a stable base for movement. When this movement quality starts to suffer, it can lead to shoulder pain. 

---
One of the most common causes of shoulder pain is due to impingement. By some estimates, it can account for up to 65% of shoulder pain cases (3)
Shoulder impingement results when due to poor biomechanics, soft tissue become painfully trapped and compressed during shoulder movement. Long story short, your subacromial space isn't spacious enough. The subacromial space is the space between the top of the humerus and the acromion.  In this space are a number of structures, including the tendons of your rotator cuff, and the long head of your bicep, as well as sub-acromial bursae. Shoulder impingement leads to this space becoming too small for the tendons to move in and over time they become inflamed, which causes pain, especially when lifting your arm overhead. The classic symptom of shoulder impingement is difficulty in lifting the arm past shoulder height. It can also hurt to reach your arm behind your back, or even lay on the affected arm. 


In shoulder impingement, EMG studies have shown decreased activity certain muscles in the rotator cuff, lower traps and serratus anterior at various stages of the movement.  Across studies, changes in the activity of the scapular muscles, especially trapezius and middle and lower serratus anterior, have been associated with various shoulder related pathologies including shoulder impingement . As well as those structures being weak, we also have that people with a shortened pec minor can exhibit altered scapular kinematic patterns similar to those found in people with shoulder impingement. Essentially, the pec minor can act as an unwanted antagonist during normal movement of the arm (2)(5)

We have two groups, one that is lacking strength and one that is lacking mobility. It follows that we can split the program into two parts:



#Mobility
##butcher's block
We will start the mobilising our thoracic spine by performing the butcher's block. Grab a broom handle or light bar with an underhand grip. To get the best out of this movement, we need to make sure that our shoulders are externally rotated the entire time, so to do this when you set up make sure that your elbows are more narrow than your grip.  From here we are going to sit our weight back onto our heels, with our abs contracted the entire time. It's important to make sure that do not curve excessively through our lower back, because that will mean we are not getting movement at the thoracic spine, like we want. 

##pec minor
To stretch the pecs, we are going to do the doorframe stretch. This will target our pec minor which when tight can lead to depression of the clavicle and protraction of the shoulders — thereby exacerbating shoulder impingement.

The pec minor lies underneath your pec major, and the important thing to note is the orientation of the muscle fibres, this will help us have the optimal angle to stretch the pec minor.
We are going to do the classic doorway stretch, so we can hit both sides at the same time.  Raise your arms above shoulder height and rest your elbows against a door frame, the key is to have the upper angle of your arm @ 45 degrees because that is going to result in the best stretch for the pec minor. Lean forward through the door and relax into the stretch. Hold for two minutes.

#Strengthening


##External rotation
I'm sure a lot of you have been in a gym and seen somebody doing a variation on this exercise. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is a fantastic way to develop strength in the external rotators that can be done without equipment. Just lay on your side and grab a light object, like a water bottle, or can of soup. Pin something in between your elbow and ribs to keep your arm in the ideal position and prevent any other muscles from taking over the movement.   External rotation is just rotating the arm outwards, so keep a 90° at the elbow and rotate your arm. It's important the movement isn't too big and that it is just your arm that is moving, and nothing else otherwise other muscles will take over. Do a couple of sets of about 10 reps with a light weight, as these muscles are quite small and will fatigue quickly.

##superman
To strengthen our lower traps, we are going to do the superman. To perform the superman, are going to lie face down . As your lower traps might be quite weak due to inactivity, we will start with our arms down by our hips. We begin the movement by lifting our chest and hands off the floor externally rotating our hands and once we are at the top of the movement we squeeze our shoulder blades back and down. Two of the movements that the lower traps are responsible for are retraction and depression of the scapulae, which is the squeezing of your shoulder blades back and down, respectively.   Over time as our strength increases, we can progressively overload the lower traps by trying the following positioning of our arms. 3 sets of 10.

##Dynamic Hug
Research has shown that movements that maintain an upwardly rotated scapula, while performing scapular protraction elicited the greatest EMG activity from the serratus anterior(4). So what that  means for us is that if we elevate the upper arm past the shoulder line, we will get more activation of the serratus anterior. A great exercise, with an even better name is the dynamic hug. To perform a dynamic hug, you can use either a cable attachment, or a resistance band, but make sure you set it up at a position lower than your shoulder, to allow your arm to travel upwards as you do it. At first glance this might look like  a chest press, but look what is happening at the shoulder.  Two of the functions of the serratus anterior are to protract and upwardly rotate the shoulder blades. The benefits of the dynamic hug are in the end of the movement, as the arm is extended out, think about bringing both arms around something by protracting your shoulder blades. For further activation, make sure your arms are reaching out higher than shoulder height, as this has been shown to increase activation in serratus anterior. 3x10 with a pause at the end position

##Pillowcase wallslide
Another way of training your serratus anterior is the wall slide. Put both arms inside a pillow case and try to push your arms outward to create some tension, and place them against the wall, leaning forwards to create some resistance. Again, thinking about protracting your shoulder blades the entire time, slide your arms up and down the wall. As you bring your arms higher into shoulder extension the more your serratus will have to contract to to keep the position of protraction. Remember that the serratus anterior control the movement of the shoulder blades, so make sure you are focussing on getting movement there, and not just your arms. Think about bringing your shoulder blades around the side of your ribs as you bring your arms upward. 3 x 8 reps, 3 seconds up, 3 seconds down

So there you go, we have a program that addresses the causes for the most common cause of shoulder pain - shoulder impingement! I hope that this helps improve any shoulder issues you're having :)

"I [M15] just did 500 pushups for one month, now what?",somethingyes2,793,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/huetse/i_m15_just_did_500_pushups_for_one_month_now_what/,1595218983.0,"Edit: On the title I meant 500 pushups everyday for a month not for all in one month

For some background all the way back in Feburary my arms were weak. They were so weak that I could only do about 5 pushups without stopping before passing out and be sore the next day. Anyway when quarantine hit (middle of March), I set out a goal to work on getting my arms more stronger and less scrawny. I worked my way up from only being able to do 10 pushups without stopping, to 15, 20, and now 25. I began to see major improvement in how my arms looked and overall how easy daily activities became. Anyway about a month ago I decided to set a goal for myself to 500 pushups a day. I wanted to challenge myself and see if I had the endurance to do it. I figured that overall this would help strengthen 
my arms tremendously and all together be good for my health. First couple days go by and it was difficult. However I kept pushing and I made it to a month! Now it has became basically a way of life for me. I wake up, do 500 pushups, sleep, and the cycle continues. A month has passed and now I'm still going to do it, it's doesn't really hurt or get in the way of my day so why should I stop?

However progress from when I started has been good but not anything tremendous. Truthfully I thought my arms would look like Arnold Schwarzenegger's (not literally but you get the point). My arms look better and kind of muscular now but if you saw me in public you wouldn't think I was a guy who did (or could do) 500 pushups a day. I do the pushups correctly (I even looked it up) but I'm still kind of scrawny. 

I was doing some research about doing 500 pushups a day and many ""experts"" on the internet said it's impossible and only ""elite athletes"" could do it. Lol I am no where near an elite athlete but I somehow figured out to do it. However some people said that it was not really worth to do it. Maybe truthfully it wasn't. I didn't get maximum results like I thought I would get. However the results weren't bad and I am still proud of myself. So now I'm stuck because I have literally no idea what I should do now? Should I keep going, or not? Should I integrate something else in like pullups or what? I don't go to the gym at all so could that be the reason why I'm not getting maximum results? These are all questions I have right now and I am no expert in stuff like this so it would be great for some help. Anyway I appreciate the help. 

Have a great day (:

Edit: Btw I'm planning on doing 1000 pushups tomorrow so is that a good idea?"
"CaliMove has made a great introduction to home workouts with bodyweight, for newcomers to at-home training, this will be a very good and easy introduction to get you started!",Captain_Nachos,796,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/flz9n4/calimove_has_made_a_great_introduction_to_home/,1584726355.0,"Link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fnR9yREU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR1fnR9yREU)

Following the hullabaloo with my review of Jeff Cavalier's home workout video, several comments in the thread asked 'ok well what video should I be watching to learn what to do?' or 'why dont you stop trashing our poor lil jeffykins without giving a better option?'. Most individuals were directed, as usual, to the sidebar which is a great resource and full of useful info for people. I was scrolling through youtube today and I just happened to find this video.

My review of Jeff's program also sparked a little debate about marketing ethics in the fitness industry and whether practices employed by individuals such as Jeff that I personally consider detestable (clickbait, fear mongering, misleading titles) are justifiable in the endeavour of making a living as a fitness youtube content creator.

Personally, I have no desire to continue the debate on that specifically as I've made all my views clear in the last thread, but instead would like to give example of a really high quality, non-clickbait, very informative video by Calimove (one of the better channels among the youtube fitness cohort imo). This alone is all you should need to see that the way Jeff markets his content is not 'just how it is' to make money. Because Calimove are also in the business of fitness youtube for a living, and they provide useful free information while they can also advertise their paid content honestly and earnestly, as you see in this video. They do it without manipulation, scare tactics, or clickbait titles. Most importantly, you'll notice they've released a home workout introduction guide without even once opportunistically leveraging the coronavirus media scare frenzy as many other youtubers have, and are producing honest, useful and really well filmed content. As much as I don't like 'youtube fitness', these guys are a pretty exemplary example of how to do it right in my opinion.

This video provides a basic introduction and guide to all the basic bodyweight strength, mobility AND endurance exercises (for all of you with varying goals, finally!) to help you get started, and actually provides some interesting ideas for equipment substitution that I had never considered before.

Particularly, the rows using the tops of the chair instead of just using a broomstick across the seats (as they also demonstrate).

Hopefully members and self-isolating newcomers alike will find some utility from this video.

Once you've used that as an introduction to the concept and maybe have trained like they outline at the end of the video for a while, have a look at the sidebar and maybe even see if you can incorporate some things from the RR into your training too. Ultimately the program they outline isn't too far off the RR anyway in a general sense.

Let me know what you think,

My outdoor bodyweight gym. It's not much but it's mine.,deletive-expleted,787,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9l19gt/my_outdoor_bodyweight_gym_its_not_much_but_its/,1538574140.0,"[Pic](https://imgur.com/a/QnQ5ShF). 

I had wood lying about for ages. I ground the soccer goal that my F in law made for the kids into bars. Some screws and paint from the shop and a few afternoons. 

I was worried that not having posts in the ground would leave it unstable, but the stands do a fine job (although I have to tell the kids not to swing on it). 

I need to make the parallels a bit more stable, and add a step for one legged squats. 

**Edit** Thanks for all the kind words guys. I just realised that when I used ""It's not much but it's mine"" I was comparing myself against all the [other](https://imgur.com/gallery/LIFfO) [awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12pbfwMLxCI) [gyms](http://www.garagegymreviews.com/diy-outdoor-bodyweight-gym/) that I've been looking at during my research. No offence intended to all the Gs keepin' it real with minimal equipment. 

Also just to give some scale, I'm 6'3""/190cm and the high pull up bar is just beyond my fingertips. The parallels are just over my elbow when standing up. "

I finally got sick of it and I lost the first 15 lbs just from eating out less (over the course of 4 months) and now over the last 2 months ive lost 25lbs by Elimintating ALL carbs and sugars and fairly severe calorie restriction (id estimate I eat 1500-1700 calories a day, while on an average workday i burn 3000-3500 according to my fitbit, as i am on my feet for 9+ hours straight) and yes i know that that level of restriction is not considered ""safe"" but my energy levels have not suffered and i am consistently supplementing my minerals and electrolytes, and have had no adverse affects so far so im sticking with it. I will be switching back to a regular macro counting style diet after i hit my goal weight.

I just hit 220 today and i couldn't be happier to be ""halfway there"". 

Starting now, over the next four months Im hoping to cut back down to 180 and hopefully gain back the muscle ive lost and maybe put on a little more. 

My old Personal best was 23 chinups in a row and as of today i was only able to do 3 after years of no training.

Welcome to the HANDSTAND Motivational Month! Today is the start so please check in NOW and tell us what YOUR goal is!,Antranik,786,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2n9oye/welcome_to_the_handstand_motivational_month_today/,1416842610.0,"Welcome to the Handstand Motivational Month, where we will be adamantly improving our handstands for a month, together! 

Last time we did this, it was for the [L-sits](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2ghahq/30day_lsit_challenge_welcome_to_the_lvmanna/), and it was really fun. So now, for the next 4 weeks, we'll be working on our Handstands.

The beauty of the handstand is that there is SOOOO much you could work on.  So here goes...

---------------------
###Your goal is a Freestanding Handstand

Here are the things that will help you get there...

* Wrist and Shoulder Mobility
 * *Mandatory* Wrist Mobility/Warm Up ([this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE) is easy to follow along)

 * Open Those Shoulders ([Emmets post is very thorough](https://emmetlouis.wordpress.com/2014/10/04/fixing-arched-back-in-handstand/))

* Strength progressions:

 * For the Core: [Hollow Hold](http://youtu.be/44ScXWFaVBs?t=5m18s) because that's the position you need to replicate while upside down. ([Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2cqg35/starting_handstands/cji88km))

 * For the HS position: 60sec [Wall Plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jm4R3K4sJA) moving toward [**Chest to Wall HS**](http://www.bodyweightcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tyler_handstand3.png) with wrists close to wall ([Info in our wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/handstand))

* Safe ways to exit:
 * Pirouette Bail
 * Forward Roll

* Rebalancing Drills: [heel pulls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYehg2ruMN0), toe pulls, calibrations, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------
###If you have a solid Freestanding HS, choose from any of these options:

* Improve your form (Bent elbows? Arched Back? Loose legs?)

* Increase your hold time. (What is your current time?)

* Master different entries/exits

 * kicking up with one leg
 * tuck up, straddle up, pike up
 * [straddle press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xPx6-rbcfs), pike press

* Increase strength (wall runs challenge, anyone?)

* Move toward One Arm HS

* Frog Stand to HS

* Move toward [Scorpion/Vrschikasana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXppo4oE9L0) or [Mexican HS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW1Ej-YeuhU)

* Freestanding Handstand Push Ups

--------------------------------------------
##Can i do this even if I'm an ultra newb who's never done a HS before??

Yes! Read the progressions above which basically tell you to: follow/memorize the wrist warm up video, master the hollow hold so your abs get strong, and then practice the wall plank. When you feel comfortable there, move your hands closer to the wall for a nice chest-to-wall handstand.

##But I'm too scared...

That's why we have you starting with the wall plank.

##But my wrists hurt...

Then maybe the focus for your entire month should be on the wrist mobility so your wrists get stronger and hollow hold so your core is strong. The neat thing about this month is anybody from beginners to advanced can work on something.

###Now that you've seen the options, please leave a comment below with the following info:

1. Stats: What is your gender, age, height, weight?

2. Goal: What is your goal for this month? (e.g., Freestanding Handstand for 10seconds)

3. Current Progression: What progression are you at? (e.g., Chest to Wall Handstand with fingers far from wall for 30sec)

4. Have a Form Check Video? They are **highly encouraged** so that Emmet could tell you what you need to work on for greater efficiency! Take one from the side and also post the link to Emmets comment, which is currently the top comment, to make sure he sees it. :) 

**Every week, on Monday, we will have a check-in thread where you tell us what's going on.** Now, get in the habit of working on your weaknesses.  And don't be afraid to ask questions!


**EDIT:** THIS THING BLEW UP. MOST OF YOU ARE RANK BEGINNERS, and I want you guys to not ignore the BASICS... let me recap:

 * Do NOT ever neglect the wrist warm up. Your wrists are the weakest link. They are not built like ankles, yet your entire bodyweight is going on them, so please, respect them!
 * Do NOT start by kicking your feet up for back-to-wall handstands. That will lead to banana-handstands!  We want straight handstands with your core engaged!  That's why we start with chest-to-wall handstands.

"Seven month progress update! (~185 to 140lbs) M/27/5'5""- Strength training 2-3x a week with gentle cardio, tracking macros and generally focusing on form.",RossyRossy,789,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/id9kx2/seven_month_progress_update_185_to_140lbs_m2755/,1597927459.0,"Hi all,

I made a progress post a few months ago and was astounded by the amount of useful tips I was receiving, so I thought I would update with progress so far and some real-life progress pics!

As a bit of background, I had never lifted a weight or done any sort of strength training before this, but I was overweight and definitely unfit, so I decided to make a change for the better. I began dieting late 2019 but started strength training properly in Jan 2020.

**Four months in:**

May '20 - 148lbs or 67kg ([Also four months in](https://imgur.com/a/gUXw59p)) tried to match the angle somewhat! [Also four months in](https://imgur.com/a/NmOvqWp)

**Current**

Aug '20 - 141lbs or 64kg ([Current](https://imgur.com/fXvQ86e), [Current](https://imgur.com/85k0zys), [Current](https://imgur.com/hOTRDZo))

I'm currently aiming toward just under 135lbs as my minimum weight, just to cut-off as much fat as possible and really bring out any definition. I have some loose skin too, hoping to reduce that slightly.

**Exercise Routine**

My routine has been influenced by the RR but also other internet sources and some home-workout books to help with progressions. For now, the only equipment I use are a pull-up bar and some dumbbells. Hoping to get as far as I can without any extra purchases!

I try to make time to do my routine every other day, with some exceptions if I'm super busy or away from home. Usually 2-3 a week leaves me happy. I also do a lot of dog walking to contribute some gentle cardio.

My home workout consists of currently:

* Deep weighted squats (3 x 10)
* Hanging leg raises (3 x 6)
* Push-ups (3 x 14)
* Dips (3 x 12)
* Pull-ups (3 x 7)
* Wide Push-ups (3 x 14)
* Elbow Plank (3 x 45 secs)
* Reverse Superman Snow Angels (3 x 15)
* Tabletop Crunches (3 x 15)
* Leg Raises (3 x 13)
* Chin-ups (3 x 8)
* Diamond Push-ups (3 x 11)
* Dumbbell hammer curls (3 x 9) OR bicep curls (3 x 8)
* Dumbbell bench fly (3 x 9)

Writing this post makes me realize that actually every exercise has seen some progression in the last few months, which is really great to see. I use the app 'Strong' to track my workouts, and it's got a useful interval timer.  I take around 30-45 second breaks between sets, and the routine takes around 1hr 15 min - 1hr 30 mins including a short warm-up and dependent on how hot it is in my conservatory!

**Diet**

I've slowed my weight loss now, aiming to consume around my BMR each day (\~1800 cals) with an emphasis on high protein (upwards of 1g of protein for each lb of weight) and low far. I track my macros quite thoroughly and try to ensure at least 30% of my cals come from protein and a higher emphasis toward carbs than fats. A typical day for me would be something like this (you'll be pleased to here I am somewhat better at consuming the greens!):

* Breakfast - porridge and milk
* Lunch - Eggs, low fat sausages, high protein cheese
* Dinner - Lean meat (usually beef, pork or chicken) with a smaller portion of carbs (pasta, small wraps, rice), many veggies (carrots, green beans, onion, mushrooms, butternut squash, peppers)
* Snacks - Greek/icelandic style yoghurt, almond nuts

For those who are interested I use this [BMR Calculator](https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/).

I try to avoid sweet snacks or high calorie drinks, and I've completely cut-out alcohol which has helped massively. I also have a whey protein drink with powder and milk, one portion a day just to boost the protein whilst I'm at quite low calories.

**Plan moving forward**

I'm aiming to continue with my body re composition over the next couple of months, and aiming to drop my weight down toward about 135lbs - not sure if I'll reach this but I figured it would help with my BF% and loose skin.

Eventually I will look to maintaining that weight, perhaps with a little muscle and strength growth and add on a few extra hundred calories.

I'm super pleased with the progress so far (and my wife loves it!) but I'm keen to see ways I can improve whilst still fitting into my days. I work from home full-time which gives me lots of time to fit workouts in, and whilst the weather is fine I'm enjoying the walks. I need to get back into cycling, perhaps once I've upped my calories a bit to avoid too much muscle loss through excessive cardio?

I hope perhaps that some tips will fly my way and maybe it might inspire others to make a similar change! I feel world's better, and I know this will set me up for later in life and I'm keen to avoid jumping back to my old physical health."

Gymnastic Rings are amazing and the first and last exercise equipment you'll ever need.,iwillwilliwhowilli,783,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/97tn3n/gymnastic_rings_are_amazing_and_the_first_and/,1534435956.0,"It's so strange to me how rings aren't constantly emphasised here, even the RR has taken focus away from them. 

This is going to be my love letter to gymnastic rings and why you should have a pair. 

If you can only have ONE piece of exercise equipment, it should be rings, Rings are incredible in the level you can achieve and their versatility. 

* *Rings act as both parallel bars and a pullup bar.* Save some dime and space. 

* *Rings are perfect for beginners* despite what you might've heard. They are *incrementally* scalable. You don't need a counter top or chair if you can't do floor push-ups, there's a more elegant solution: lengthen the straps of the rings and step forward till you can do pushups on them. Inch your feet back every workout to make them harder. 
 Do the opposite for rows. 

My arthritic granny can do ring pushups and rows; they're infinitely scalable.

* *Rings are portable*. You're not going to lose gains on a month long trip when the best exercise equipment around is also small enough to fit in a laptop bag, ready to hang from a palm tree branch. 

* *Rings greatly increase the exercises you can do.* I'll specifically mention the muscle-up, a move where you perform a pullup and then at the top transition into a ring dip - this is the quintessential way to get on top of rings and exercise like no other in its application and muscles used. (You can technically do this on a bar, it's far harder to even train.)

* *Rings let BWFers do isolation/accessory work*. You don't need a dumbbell to target weak points. You can do curls and chest flys with rings. They also allow you to much more easily target a weak side with archer rows and archer pushups.

* *Rings greatly increase the upper ceiling of what BWF can achieve*. The upper limit is boundless. In my totally unscientific opinion there are very few people who can't achieve their genetic potential with rings for upper body. 

* *Rings are cheap*. Rings come at about 40 euro.

I've trained with teenage girls, pregnant women on their third trimester and gymnastic coaches, and no one I love the rings simplicity, the primitivism, how they feel at home on the playground. How you can twist and swing on them for fun. 

You should still squat with barbells though.

You should start doing face pulls now,jimlii,783,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/t63aw7/you_should_start_doing_face_pulls_now/,1646346009.0,"Disclaimer: I am not a professional

However, from my personal experience, face pulls (which I perform on rings) have been the best addition to my workout. Immediately after completing a set of face pulls my shoulders feel healthier and more stable. As someone who has rounded shoulders, like many of us do, I also feel that my shoulders sit in a more anatomically correct position than before. Aesthetically, I can tell that my shoulders are looking much better from a lateral perspective.

It took me a while to get the form of face-pulls down, and to be able to isolate and feel the activation of my rear delts. But after a while they finally clicked and they're one of my favorite exercises because they just feel good and healthy! I recommend incorporating them into your routine if you have rings. If you don't have rings just cough up the 30 bucks and get some already!!"

Jan '20 - 184lbs or 82kg ([Before (not staged)](https://imgur.com/a/kUXpJzQ)

May '20 - 148lbs or 67kg  ([Current](https://imgur.com/a/gUXw59p) tried to match the angle somewhat! [Also Current](https://imgur.com/a/NmOvqWp))

I'm currently aiming toward 140lbs as my minimum weight, just to cut-off as much fat as possible before bulking. Then I'll be looking at upping my caloric intake so that I have the surplus for some decent muscle gain.

**Exercise Routine**

I started to try and follow the RR, although I didn't have rings and some of the exercises I found extremely challenging. I dabbled around the internet for a while, and settled on as much variation as I could find to create a simple hour-long routine that I could do with minimum equipment and at home, especially during lock down. This consists of:

* Squats (3 x 20)
* Pull-ups (3 x 6)
* Push-ups (3 x 12)
* Dips (3 x 10)
* Wide Push-ups (3 x 12)
* Elbow Plank (3 x 45 secs)
* Reverse Snow Angels (3 x 20)
* Tabletop Crunches (3 x 15)
* Leg Raises (3 x 12)
* Chin-ups (3 x 6)
* Diamond Push-ups (3 x 9)
* Dumbbell hammer curls (3 x 8)
* Dumbbell bench fly (3 x 11)

I've been doing this routine every other day since I started with only a couple of missed days over that period, and I've found that my core strength has increased massively. My progression is definitely still getting better in pretty much every exercise, and I'm finding that I'm able to maintain more form more effectively. I'm at the point now where I'd like to start mixing it up and identifying any missing muscles groups which I might not have noticed. I take around 30-45 second breaks between sets, and the routine takes just over an hour including a short warm-up.

I don't really do much cardio at the moment. I used to cycle around 9 miles to work every day and back, but I've moved to a working from home arrangement so my only real cardio is brisk dog walking every day (around 30 mins/2 mi).

**Diet**

I've been on a strict 1700 calorie a day diet consisting of simple, high protein food wherever possible. I've been having a protein shake every day (one portion with milk) just to ensure that I get enough protein, but otherwise my diet generally consists of something similar to:

* Breakfast - porridge and milk
* Lunch - Eggs, low fat sausages, high protein cheese
* Dinner - Lean meat (usually beef or chicken) with a smaller portion of carbs (pasta, small wraps, rice), mixed veggies (I'm a little fussy, but there are some greens in there and carrots, mainly)
* Snacks - Greek/icelandic style yoghurt, almond nuts

I try to avoid sweet snacks or high calorie drinks, and I've completely cut-out alcohol so far. I track my calories and nutrients every day and generally get around 160-170g of protein in a day. The rest of my macros are generally low carb and fat. (\~30/25/45% Carb/Fat/Protein)

**Plan moving forward**

So I'm hoping to continue with my body re composition over the next couple of months, and aiming to drop my weight down to around 140lbs. At this point I was expecting to up my calories and either maintain my weight or gain weight whilst building muscle. Probably something around 2300cals/day whilst maintaining my macro balance.

One of the issues I have is that even at 140lbs (which seems very light to me), I'm still at the top end of the BMI or recommended weights for someone of my height. I mostly see very lean, tall men on this subreddit so it's difficult for me to judge when I should stop losing weight and focus more on bulking.

If anyone has any suggestions for when to stop losing weight I'd really appreciate all the expert advice. It's still early days but I never thought I'd see the day where I could have any sort of definition on my body - even starting to spot some abs!

Core bracing is much more important than deep breathing during full body movements,HopeIsGold,782,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/12gbwls/core_bracing_is_much_more_important_than_deep/,1681024161.0,"I was not getting the right kick from my bodyweight routine for quite some time and I was wondering what I was doing wrong. I maintained correct form as much as possible. I was confused.

Then I read Nick-e's tutorials much more slowly and understood what I was doing wrong. I was brainwashed by youtube tutorials about the inhale-exhale pattern during different exercises so much that I was concentrating on breathing in and out only at the expense of losing core brace after a couple of reps. That is why I couldn't feel the rows in my back because my body was arching (although not much noticeably). I suffered from a butt wink at the bottom of my squat.  Pushups were hurting my elbows. And even after doing the compound exercises, my core was not getting stronger. 

I started giving #1 priority to ***core bracing*** during each movement and I noticed a dramatic improvement and feeling the right muscles while doing the movements. Even if I have to take only very shallow breaths during the movements."

Unlocked the muscle up!,SpaceFockuZ,782,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/logczs/unlocked_the_muscle_up/,1613854164.0,"20/02/2021, historical day for me, I unlocked my first muscle up, and I'm so proud, I took 3 minutes of rest and I did 4 muscle ups in total before failing in the 5th time.

The best advice I could give is to work on the negative muscle up, i tried to get the M-U for months without doing the negative and it was a big mistake, a week after doing the Negatives, I unlocked the muscle up with a good form

Good luck to every one grinding for it.

Gonna try to get the front lever next!"

"Thinking of Building an App/Game - Do Burpees, Level up your Hero",think99times,776,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fpc1ro/thinking_of_building_an_appgame_do_burpees_level/,1585231549.0,"Hey /r/bodyweightfitness, I'm an indie app developer.

I recently stopped doing crossfit and am trying to use bodyweight fitness to stay in shape. Mostly just simple stuff like burpees, squats, pushups etc.

As a developer, I'm always trying to think of new app ideas. I've been toying with the thought of creating an app for tracking body weight exercises that would also help me periodize. The more I've thought about it, I thought it would be fun to do it as a game.

Here's the basic idea. You have a hero/avatar in the game, the goal is to level up your hero and improve their stats and abilities. Your hero grows stronger as you do burpees in real life and log them in the app. Your hero has an energy meter, which will limit the total number of reps you are allowed to log within the first day, but the energy meter refills over time.

In the beginning, your hero is weak. They start with an energy meter capacity of 30, so you can only log 30 burpees the first day. For this you'll gain 30 experience and level up your hero. You recover +1 energy every 2 hours (so you''ll recover 12 energy 24 hours).

As you level up your hero, your energy capacity increases 30->40, 40->50 etc. Also the rate at which you recover energy get's faster. You also unlock new exercises you can do, instead of just burpees. The exercises in the app will all be body weight exercises that people can do anywhere without equipment.

As you unlock more exercises, there will be gaming mechanics to ensure you are logging a variety of exercises, like maybe the ones you do more often become worth less and the ones you've been avoiding are worth more points/burpees bucks.

You earn Burpee Bucks, which can be used to buy equipment for your hero, shoes, headbands, etc. You can equip these items to improve your stats.

What do you think, would you use an app like this?

Recommended Routine Before/After,None,781,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hr8em2/recommended_routine_beforeafter/,1594755814.0,"This progress is from January 2020 to today (July 14 2020). I’ve worked out inconsistently for a while but quarantine  kicked my commitment to RR into gear. I was about the same weight/looked the same in March as I did in January so most of the progress has been made since then. 

Not where I wanna be yet but much closer than I’ve ever been.

I’m 5’7. Weight went from ~157 to 148.

I’ve been doing intermittent fasting for about a month, which helped with body composition I think.


[Front before and after](https://imgur.com/W3MrMHB)

[Back before and after](https://imgur.com/kosM0jb)

Apologies for the poor quality. I’m bad at selfies.

I’d been doing pull-ups off and in for years, mostly using the Russian Fighter Pull-up program (admittedly only 3 times a week instead of 5). Which is probably why there’s a little less difference in the back. When I started I could do 6 pull-ups. I worked my way up to 10, then switched to weighted pull-ups a couple weeks ago. I’m at 5 pull-ups with 25 lbs.

I’ve had gymnastics rings for a while but didn’t use them much until quarantine. Worked my way from not being able to do a ring support hold for more than 10 seconds to 3x5 ring dips with 25 lbs.

Been working on a pistol squat since March. I think I need to mix things up. Used [Saturno’s Pistol Squat routine](https://youtu.be/FU6zxas1NXM) to get a single elevated pistol squat on my right leg but I’m stalled out there. I do ankle dorsiflexion stretches often with a band but I’m open to other stretches/advice on how to get there.

Other exercises:

Ring rows: 3x8 to 3x10 with 40 lbs

Hinge: single leg deadlifts 3x10 to 3x12 of the single leg variants of hamstring ring curl in [this video.](https://youtu.be/pe3fNdMcoKw)

Push-ups: 3x8 ring pushups to 3x8 RTO pushups

Also been working on skin-the-cats/front lever/back lever and handstand but they’re not my main focus currently.

The biggest thing that helped my progress was switching from doing the full routine every other day to doing half the routine every day. So pull-ups/squats/dips one day then rows/hinge/push-ups + the core routine (with ab wheel) the next. I know this isn’t recommended but once my joints and tendons adapted to the initial stress I felt like I was recovering quickly enough for it to not be a problem. It probably also helps that I take 5 minute breaks between every set (which makes the workouts super long but also gives me time to watch stuff I’ve put off on Netflix).

Open to any advice or questions! Thanks to this community for building such a well-rounded program 🙏"
Really the only thing beginners/intermediates should focus on and how to structure around it.,beyondBP,783,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ywzc0d/really_the_only_thing_beginnersintermediates/,1668618379.0,"Basics and Flexibility.  


I frequent this sub a lot and so many posts reveal a lack of a 'macro' perspective to working out.   


Nothing wrong with that, but, I just have a desire to share the perspective I think one should adopt and then the subsequent workout options that follow from it.   


Perspective; Working out should really be about exploring movements. In order to explore certain movements we must train up our body. How we structure building that foundation of strength and flexibility should match the desired movements whilst being accommodating to our body and not injuring it.   


Most people on this sub desire to explore bodyweight style strength feats (Planche, Muscle Ups, Handstand Pushups Levers, Flags, etc..). In order to achieve these skills we must focus our energy on the basics and flexibility to create the foundation that can facilitate and support those feats.  


For body weight strength feats you're going to need to have a pretty complete development. As in every plane of motion must be worked (Horizontal and Vertical for Push and Pull) and you're going to need a good deal of flexibility to prevent tendon overuse injury.  


Okay, so now, given the macro perspective, how do we go about creating a program from it?  


First, deal with each plane of motion one at a time.  


Horizontal Push: Incline Pushups, Pushups, Decline Pushups, Ring Pushups, Weighted Pushups, Pseudo Planche Pushups  


Vertical Push: Dips, Ring Dips, Weighted PB Dips, Pike Pushups, BTW Handstand Pushups, CTW Handstand Pushups, HSPU  


Horizontal Pull: Inverted Rows, Feet Elevated body horizontal to floor Inverted Rows, Weighted Inverted Rows  


Vertical Pull: Pullups, Weighted Pullups,  


Alright, so, now we have an idea of different progressions for each plane of motion.  
How do we figure out how to structure a week?  
Well we have to essentially give our body the right dosage of these movements so that our body has received the right amount of stimulus to adapt to them. Not too much to create overuse injury, but not too little either.   
That amount will differ from person to person given their fitness level. So, you'll need to test and monitor your capability week to week and adjust as you adapt.   


The general scheme for sets and reps is that 5-8 reps is biasing strength adaptation, 12-15 reps bias hypertrophy and 18+ biases endurance adaptions. 3 sets using 12-15 reps vs 5 sets using 5-8 reps.  
Same # of total volume more or less, but different way to achieve the total volume.  


For bodyweight strength feats you're going to want to go through phases (3-4months at a time) cycling between training 5-8 reps and 12-15 reps. In other words cycle between Strength and Hypertrophy. So, 3 months Hypertrophy, probably some deload week, and then 3 months Strength.   
The rationale behind this is very intuitive. Bias growing muscle, then bias making that muscle strong.   


There are many different splits you can use. Full body, Straight Arm--Bent Arm, Upper lower, etc..  
For beginners Full body is best, Intermediates I would say Upper-Lower.  
Full body should be performed 3x a week, Upper-Lower 2x a week (4 sessions total), SA-BA 2x a week (4 sessions total).  


From here we can start creating a structure for a week during lets say a Strength phase for a beginner.  
You will and should start training strength before hypertrophy as a beginner simply because you won't be able to do the movements for enough reps. As a beginner we want a full body workout.  


Vertical Pull: Pullup negatives 3x5-8  
Squat: Squats 3x5-8  


Vertical Push: PB Dips negatives  
Horizontal Pull: Inverted Row  
<-- All of this 3x a week

Horizontal Push: Incline Pushups 3x5-8  
Lunge 3x5-8  


Hollow body hold with knees tucked 3x30sec  
Seated Leg Lifts 3x5-8  


Let's make a week during Strength phase for an intermediate using Upper-Lower. Here I will introduce some isometric at start of workout and isolation at the end.   


UPPER:  
Planche Lean Isometric 3x15sec  
Adv Tuck Front Level Isometric 3x15sec  


Vertical Pull: Weighted Pullups 5x5-8   
Vertical Push: BTW HSPU 5x5-8 or Weighted Pike PU  


Horizontal Pull: Body Parallel to Floor Weighted Inverted Rows 5x5-8  
Horizontal Push: Weighted Pushups or PPPU   


Ring Facepull 3x10  
Ring Tricep Extension 3x10  


LOWER:  
Shrimp Squat 3x12  
Split Squat 3x12  
Reverse Nordic 3x8  
Single Leg Glute-ham bridge 3x12  
Single Leg Calf raise 3x12  
Tibialis Raise 3x15  


Hopefully, more or less we have an idea of how to structure workout weeks.   
Now here's a really really important note I want to emphasize.   
YOU CANNOT GO SAME INTENSITY EVERY WORKOUT. YOU MUST LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND WHEN FATIGUE IS ACCUMLATING TOO MUCH YOU NEED TO WORKOUT LESS INTENSLY. YOU WILL GET INJURED TRYING TO PEAK EVERY WORKOUT.   


I would say every 6 weeks you should take a week deload.  
And within those 6 weeks you should have some weeks more intense than others.   


Another HUGE point to emphasize. Flexibilty is EXTREMELY important. If you don't have enough shoulder flexion you're most likely headed towards a SLAP tear or fraying.  
If you don't have enough calf/soleus mobility you are most likely heading towards some PatelloFemoral Pain or Plantar Fasciitis.  
You need to focus on flexibility in order to give your tendons and ligaments room to move without rubbing up against other structures. Quite literally. It's not just to look nice or be able to reach certain positions. Being more flexible enables your anatomy to function in the right way. Doing squats with Knees gliding over toes. Pull ups and pushups with enough thoracic spin mobility and shoulder flexion to allow  the structures to be uninhibited.  


Flexibility should have as much emphasis as strength because if not you will eventually get injured unless you're an exception and just very flexible without having to work for it.   


Creating a flexibility program just as with the muscles where we identified plane of motion we first need to identify the areas of mobility needed.  
You got thoracic spine + shoulders + pecs, hips, and legs.   


For thoracic spine and shoulder butcher's block stretch, hanging, downward dog.  
For shoulders and pecs you can do stick dislocates, door frame stretch  
Hips are complicated but you can do couch stretch, butterfly, frog pose, the bottom position of the cossack squat  
Legs you can do elephant walks, jcurl for flexibility not strength, seated 1 leg hamstring  stretch,  
downward dog should be able to target calfs, bend the leg to target more of the soleus. You can also just lunge onto your front foot keeping heel on floor and finding a stretch in the soleus/calf  


This post got long really quick, Just wanted to share my input, hopefully someone derives value from this."

Hey gang! Nick-E here.

So yesterday we learned about how to do push-ups. You might have found that a little bit overwhelming! Maybe you thought to yourself 'Man, I thought push-ups were easy and simple! What the heck!'. You would not be alone in thinking that. Luckily, you aren't learning another exercise today, and you will have some more opportunity to practice them and re-consolidate all that info before you have to learn another one tomorrow.

Instead, we'll be learning some theory about exercise for your reading today!

So to summarise, today we will be:

\- reading a little bit about how exercise works,

\- and doing another push-up based mini-workout!

# Today's Learning: The S.A.I.D Principle, and Progressive Overload

So while you digest all that pushup-related learning from yesterday, we're going to learn a little bit about how and why exercise 'works', and provide a (hopefully) easy way of conceptualising what exercise is doing to your body. On the scale of 'Simple but reductive' to 'complex and scientific but very semantically accurate', we'll be leaning more to the former, as this is a beginner routine!

\----

**The S.A.I.D Principle**

\----

So in order to illustrate how exercise impacts the body, we have to establish two general ideas:

1. **Your muscular system does not like working harder than it needs to**
2. **Your body overall does not like using more resources than it needs to.**

Because it does not like working hard, it will make sure that it can do the things it does **most often** in the **easiest and most efficient** way possible. That usually means diverting resources to the parts of the body that help you do that thing. At the same time, it will not put any effort (or resources) towards maintaining or building up your ability to things that you **never do**.

This is the foundation of an extremely important concept in fitness called the S.A.I.D principle. SAID stands for '**Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands**'.

**EXAMPLE 1:**

Say there is a person named Alex. Alex has an office job from 9 til 5, and they commute in their car. Alex has a lot of hobbies that do not require very much physical exertion. Listening to music, browsing the internet, social media and reading books are some of their favourite things to do when they aren't at work. Depending on how long Alex has had this lifestyle, it's possible that their body is happily existing in a state of *homeostasis* because it has perfectly adapted to the **demands** of that lifestyle.

In this example, the **demands** of a sedentary job with sedentary hobbies, is very low. This means that the body does not need to maintain the **neuromusculoskeletal** (nerves, muscles, joints and bones), **cardiovascular** (heart and blood vessels), or **respiratory** (lungs) systems to a higher level than they need to support your ability to sit down, walk short distances, and use your arms a little.

**EXAMPLE 2:**

Say for example we take Alex, and then add a new detail. Now we say that Alex used to do county-level competitive swimming in middle school and high school, but has since stopped and hasn't really exercised since then.

In their teen years, throughout years of swimming practice, training, meets and races, Alex's body became adapted to swimming. Initially swimming was hard to do, so over the years the body made the muscles that were required to do the swim strokes stronger and more enduring, and made their heart and lungs better at getting oxygen to the muscles. It did this in order to make the task that it had to do CONSTANTLY much easier and more efficient.

Importantly, swimming did not make Alex extremely strong and fit and good at everything, it just made the necessary improvements in order to Alex really really good at *swimming*. This is where the 'Specific Adaptations' part of the SAID principle comes in. It would not make sense to your frugal, energy-conserving body to make Alex good at everything, because that would be a waste! **However**, some of the adaptations that made Alex good at swimming also made them good at some other things coincidentally. (e.g. It took Alex less time to get up a long staircase, and they were rarely out of breath by the top of it. Also, when Alex tried other forms of cardio exercise (running, cycling), it would have felt much easier than before they started swimming and they may have been better than their friends that didn't do any exercise at those things, despite it being their first time.)

But how do we go from this young fit Alex, to the Alex of today? As soon as the **imposed demand** of swimming goes away, the body stops seeing the need to maintain such an elevated performance of the muscles and cardiovascular system. So it stops, and over time all that has been maintained is what is required to sit, walk short distances, and move their arms around a little, because that is the **imposed demand** of a sedentary, office job lifestyle!

*(Side note: The adaptations Alex got from their swimming career are not strictly gone and dead by this point, in reality its about halfway between gone and* ***dormant***\*. Generally speaking it's much easier to re-gain fitness adaptations than to gain them the first time round. But that's another topic.)\*

\----

**Progressive Overload**

\----

So now we know that thanks to the SAID principle, if we do something, our bodies will make the necessary changes to get better **specifically** at that thing, and in order to keep those adaptations **we have to keep putting the demands that necessitate them** on our bodies, **over time**! So you decide you want to generally get stronger and build some muscle for \[insert your personal reason right here\]. So you decide to start some strength training. You find a 20lbs dumbbell in your attic and start lifting it in a variety of ways. It's quite hard to lift it, so this must make you stronger if you do it enough! Thanks, SAID principle. You're a lifesaver.

You get into a bit of a habit with that and eventually lifting the dumbbell gets very easy. You keep doing it, and lifting the dumbell stays easy. Weeks pass, and it's still easy. You don't seem to be getting any stronger. What once was hard, now is not hard. Your body has no reason to keep getting stronger because its extremely well adapted to lifting this dumbbell!

You briefly feel tricked and betrayed by the SAID principle before you log onto reddit and see a post called 'BWF Primer Community Workout: Day 2', where you learn about a concept called 'Progressive Overload'.

Compared to the SAID principle, this one is super simple. It basically means, in any effective strength training program, the demand you are putting on your body always needs to be one step ahead of your bodies adaptation to that demand.

To apply that to the above example:

Once that 20lbs dumbbell gets easy, you need to move on to a 25lbs dumbbell, and eventually that too will get easy, and then you'll move onto a 30lbs dumbbell, and this process will repeat until you feel like you are strong enough, your body looks the way you want it to, and you are capable of doing all the things you want!

This is the principle behind why in this program, every session you will be trying to do 1 more rep than you did last time in each exercise. It is giving a **progressively** greater **load** (demand) to overcome, that is always just a little bit **over** what it's used to!

# Workout #2:

In the spirit of progressive overload, this workout is simply a repeat of the first workout, but progressing the reps!

5 sets of 6 pushups (5x6 Pushups) at whatever incline is appropriate, with 60s rest.

(NOTE: Many of you starting the program may have gone sprinting out of the gate on Day 1, doing the hardest incline you could or even full floor pushups. The focus of this build-up period to the full Primer routine is on technique practice, not pushing it to the limit. If you did go out all guns blazing on Day 1, I'd strongly advise picking an easier level of inclination if you have one available to you.)

In the next workout tomorrow, we will be adding another exercise.

# Ok, I did it!

Congratulations!

"10 Months of training, hopefully motivational and thank you",ZxC23097124,775,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/got0hi/10_months_of_training_hopefully_motivational_and/,1590185570.0,"I just wanted to give something back to say thank you. I don't know if I'm knowledgeable to comment on many of the posts, so i was hoping i could maybe motivate someone else on their journey.

I use to train a lot, then i tore my ACL, did rehab, was motivated to get back into it, eventually healed, then a year or two later i tore my kneecap off on the other knee ( complete rupture of the patellae tendon). Second injury really demotivated me, fell out of training for the next 4 to 5 years. I was weighing in at about 98Kg at a height of 187cm, i'm currently 38 years old. I'm now 83kg.

Decided to start training after hearing myself tell someone i ""used to train a lot"" and couldn't stand hearing myself say ""used to"" anymore.

I didn't really take a starting pic. Someone sent me this pick to remind me what i looked like. This was round August last year [https://imgur.com/a/aVBsGKZ](https://imgur.com/a/aVBsGKZ)

This was after a few months of hitting cardio really hard (cycling, swimming, boxing): [https://imgur.com/a/bhB7zm8](https://imgur.com/a/bhB7zm8)

Took this pick April 8th: [https://imgur.com/a/AnwbwHS](https://imgur.com/a/AnwbwHS)

Currently i do Boxing and RR (1 day fast/1 day slow). When the gyms open again i'll mix some swimming in again. I try train most days, i take a day off if i feel fatigued. I also cycle in the mornings when i can. I take supplements to help me with recovery (CoQ10, l-glutamine, whey protein, creatine, MSM, omega oil, multi vitamin)

To start eating healthy, all i did was cut out junk. Stopped eating take out, packets of chips, sweets, stuff that was obviously bad. I'm now at the point where i'm making my own meals. It's journey so take it in stages. It's all about consistency. I still struggle to consistently eat my calories every day, eating clean means i need to eat a lot more to hit my calories, so i tend to be at a deficit, still working on that to build more. I'm not hungry, but i can feel it in my recovery.

I didn't complete stop eating everything, if i go out with friends i'll still join in and have a burger or a drink or whatever. I just don't buy it for myself or store it in the house, I keep healthy snacks in the house ( i do have a pizza or takeout night once a week watching a movie with the mrs).

For the RR, big thing was putting away ego. Start where you can maintain good from. This is what makes the progressions so great, anyone can find a starting point. Form is incredibly important, so don't do stuff you can't really do, focus on good form.

This video helped me a lot getting my head right.

You're not going to feel like training every day, 90% is just showing up.

Force yourself to do it.

Make tiny incremental changes every day to improve.

*The warrior and the artist* live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the *battle* must be fought anew *every day*.

Thanks again for the great sources of info here, its really helped me, and the RR is a killer routine."
How to Achieve Your First Pull-Up: A Beginners Guide,rickdonohoe,777,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aqw7eb/how_to_achieve_your_first_pullup_a_beginners_guide/,1550234697.0,"At the end of 2018 I surveyed the Reddit community to find out how many people can perform a single pull-up. The survey got some interesting responses, but overall I received some (warranted) criticism as most respondents would likely not understand the technique expected of a pull-up using correct form.

As a follow on from the survey, I decided to write a beginners guide to demonstrate how somebody can achieve their first unassisted pull-up using the following 5 progressions:

1. Australian pull-ups (rows)
2. Band assisted pull-ups
3. Jumping pull-ups
4. Negative pull-ups
5. Chin-ups

[You can read the full guide here](https://www.calisthenics-101.co.uk/how-to-achieve-your-first-pull-up-a-beginners-guide).

I'd welcome any feedback (good or bad), as I'm interested in updating the guide where necessary to turn it into a great resource for beginners who are keen to get started on their bodyweight fitness journey!

Thanks in advance!"
I finally did 100 pull ups in <10:00,bbqyak,780,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8pxvvw/i_finally_did_100_pull_ups_in_1000/,1528597640.0,"Pretty proud to finally be among the sub 10 min crew. Probably took me 8 months?

If you're wondering how I trained for it... I just do 100 pull ups as fast as I can every 2 weeks. Other than that, all I do is weighted pull ups.

Anyone else try this? What is your time?

How I lost 20 Pounds in 3 Months by doing Circuit Training,eatsleephustle,771,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/d5vt9i/how_i_lost_20_pounds_in_3_months_by_doing_circuit/,1568802815.0,"You guys may know me from this [body transformation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aau4mj/4_things_i_learnt_calisthenics_body/) where I have lost 20 pounds in 3 months and changed my physique radically over the course of 12 months. I just made a [video](https://youtu.be/u_Di4dpxPFk) showing how my workout was like when I started. ***In essence, I am suggesting that circuit training is the best form of training for most beginners.***

By way of background, an example of circuit training (as shown in the [video](https://youtu.be/u_Di4dpxPFk)) goes like this:

1. Mountain Climber 30 seconds
2. High to low plank 30 seconds
3. Bench dips 15 reps
4. Jumping Pull ups 10 reps
5. Push ups 20 reps
6. Wall sit 30 seconds (can be weighted)
7. Straight bar dips 10 reps
8. Explosive squats 12 reps

Repeat 1-8 for 3 Rounds. Rest for 15 seconds – 1 min between sets, 2-3 mins between rounds, depending on how much a beginner you are. You can adjust the repetitions of each exercise according to your fitness level. Ideally, each exercise should be done with 1 rep/5 seconds short of failure.

I find this type of workout (i.e. (i) full body workout (ii) performed in a circuit manner ) suitable for beginners as it is very effective in burning fat and building muscle at the same time. Below is further elaboration on why circuit training is preferable to split workouts, cardios and bodybuilding routines that characterizes themselves by doing the same exercise for 3 to 4 sets consecutively before going on to the next exercise.

**1.** **More volume, more progress**

Most beginners have little idea about their physical limits and they miss out a lot of gains because they are not aware that they can handle more volume than they think. A beginner need not worry too much about RPEs (rate of perceived exertion), RMs (Repetition maximum), MRV (maximal recoverable volume), which are powerlifting concepts that will become important at a later stage.

Many beginners try desperately to learn a new move as fast as possible and for this reason, their workouts become strength sessions, where the intensity of their exercise are at or above 85% of their 1RM. They end up just doing 10 to 20 pull ups/pushups a session, which is too little a volume to see meaningful progress. Beginners should try to build more volume so they can at least basic strength. Training circuits will guarantee you a high volume with the right intensity (if each exercise is done with 1 rep short of failure).

**2.** **More demanding on cardiovascular system**

As opposed to doing 4 consecutive sets of bench press, which normally requires 2 min rest in between sets, in circuit training, you can go on to the next exercise without much rest as you are engaging a different group of muscle. This will put pressure on your cardiovascular system, which is ideal for weight loss.

**3.** **Longer rest for the same group of muscle**

Although the rest period between each exercise is shorter, you wouldn't be doing the same exercise until the next round. This effectively allows more time for the same group of muscles to recover.

I just thought I share my bwf journey with you!
 
First of all, I just tell everything chronologically, I think it's better to see what progress I made. Second, my native language is german, so I'm sorry for mistakes. I'll do my best. And It’s not really 2 years, but I count the effective days of bodyweight training, not that random year before. Oh and I use an alt just because of reasons.
 
#TL;DR
 
Transformed with bodyweight exercises from aesthetically [okay](https://i.imgur.com/pbNxGyu.png) to aesthetically [better](http://i.imgur.com/CRdpCLM.jpg) in 2 years . Ate bad for the first year, then good, changed my workout plan 3 times and structured my diet. Get fit, be happy and do things reasonably!
 
#2014  
 
[This](https://i.imgur.com/pbNxGyu.png) was me when I started (sorry, don't have a better picture).
 
One day, I don’t know why, I looked in the mirror and thought to myself: *“hey it's time. you need to change something about your appearance. You're not happy with that. Do something”.* I was to shy and embarrassed to go to the gym (at that time I thought people would give a fuck at how I looked or how I trained), so I looked for another way to get in a better shape.
 
I wasn't super skinny, did some sport here and there, but never really was that active.
 
So I did what all people do at some point of their life, start something without really knowing what to do. I bought a pull up bar (which I still have to this day!) and was ready to go.
 
##Workout  
At that point I wouldn’t really call it a workout, I just did some chin-ups (started with a chair for help) and push-ups every other day. I really don’t had any idea what reps and sets were or which muscles I had to train. I just did…something. I noticed some strength, but I wouldn’t call it an effective year. Mostly I did:
 
* 3x8 Pull-Ups  
* 3x8 Push-Ups
* 3x8 Biceps Curls (with some dumbbells)
 
As you see, that was something, but not much.
 
##Diet  
I was just eating what we had at home, I haven’t moved out at that time, so I didn’t count calories or eat less or more. That way I became kind of skinny-fat (I always had some kind of genetic disposition to put on weight at my abdominal region). I didn't weight myself or tracked anything.
 
##Result  
[This](https://i.imgur.com/wUaLJ2A.png) is the best picture I could find. My shoulders were a bit wider, but that's it. 
 
#2015 (You Are Your Own Gym)
After one year I still wasn’t really pleased with myself, I had a bad posture, my skin was not good and overall: I just wanted to change my body and myself, again.
 
I got my first smartphone and some day I just opened the Google Play Store and searched for “bodyweight fitness”. I looked through a lot of apps, but wasn’t really happy with all the pricing (or the free apps). After some hours of research, I decided to try the App “You Are Your Own Gym”. So my first “real” workout plan was set:
 
##Workout
*“You Are Your Own Gym”* or also called YAYOG is a book from Mark Lauren. He was, as I recall, an ex-Drill Instructor for the military (?) and started to sell a fitness program, which didn’t need any equipment (which is not really true, but true in a gym-with-machines way) and exactly what I was looking for at that time.
 
The Workout consists of 4 programs for every level (Basic, 1st Class, Master Class and Chief Class) , every program lasts 10 weeks and I think it’s mostly for endurance and strength.
 
You train 4 days a week with ULUL (U = Upper Body, L = Legs) with one day pause between every training day. (like U-L-U-L, or I think you can go UL-UL-- if you want a free weekend)
 
The weeks consists of:
 
* *Week 1 and 2*: Ladder exercises (where you do 1 rep, then 2, then 3, ..until you can’t do anymore reps, then you start to count down, also called pyramid exercises)
 
* *Week 3 and 4*: Interval Sets, so the normal rep sets, 3x8-12, 3 exercises.
 
* *Week 5 and 6*: Supersets, where you do one hard exercise with low reps, followed by an easier exercise with more reps.
 
* *Week 7-10*: Every day is an exercise form of the week before and the training is extended to 5 days a week. So:  
Day 1: Ladders     
Day 2: Interval Set  
Day 3: Superset  
Day 4: Tabatas (High Intensity Intervall Training)  
Day 5: Stappers (3 exercises, 20 minutes, no rest)
 
This is an example of week 7 from the 1st class program:
 
**Day 1 - Upper Body (Ladder):**
 
* Chinese Push-ups
* Classic Push-ups
* Close Grip Push-up
* Seated Dips
 
**Day 2 - Legs (Supersets)**
 
* One legged Squats (5 reps)
* Toyotas (12 reps) (where you start in a squat position and jump in the air)
* Side Lunges (5 reps)
* Back Lunges (12 Reps)
* One-legged Romanian Deadlift (5 reps) (this is not the traditional deadlift with weights)
* Box Jumps (12 Reps)
 
**Day 3 - Upper Body (Interval)**
 
* 3x Pull Ups Assisted (12 Reps)
* 3x Rows (12 Reps)
* 3x Biceps Curls (with Towel)
 
**Day 4 - Legs (Tabatas or HIIT)**
 
* 4 min, Russian Twists
* 4min, Flutter Kicks
* 4min, Squats
 
**Day 5 - Upper and Lower Body (Stappers)**
 
* 20 min, Rows, Side Lunges and Push-Ups (8 reps of everything, then again until time runs out)
 
You see, the program is very good to get fit, but don’t expect some big aesthetic results. And the requirements were kind of hard:
 
* **Basic Program**: no requirements
* **1st Class**: 
 * 10 Push ups with a two second pause at the top and bottom of the movement
 * 10 Rows with your legs straight and feet on the ground
 * 15 Back Lunges on each leg with a three second pause at the bottom of the movement
 * Hold a static Push-Up position for 1 minute
* **Master Class**: 
 * 16 One-Arm Push Ups elevated on a mid thigh-high surface, alternating arms after each rep for 8 total on each side
 * 5 Pull Ups with a two second pause at the top and the bottom of the movement
 * 24 alternating One-Legged Squats, bringing your butt down lightly onto a just below knee-high platform, alternating legs after each rep for 12 total on each side.
 * Hold a static Push-Up position for 3 minute
 
* **Chief Class**: 
 * 16 One-Arm Push Ups, alternating arms after each rep for 8 total on each side
 * 12 Pull Ups with a 1 second pause at the top and the bottom of the movement
 * 24 Pistol Squats, alternating legs after each rep for 12 total on each side.
 * Hold a static Push-Up position for 5 minute
 
The gap between the Master Class and the Chief Class is kind of big, that was my biggest problem with the program. After one year I finished the Master Class 3 times, but didn’t get to the chief class, because I couldn’t do 24 Pistol Squats and got more and more frustrated. If you consider doing this workout, buy the book! There are a lot of helpful informations regarding the exercises and diet. I bought it a little bit too late and most of the informations really could have helped me.
 
##Diet
I now was living alone, studying and yes, money was a big thing, so I was living on a tight budget. I was eating much healthier than I did at home, some sweets 
are really expensive when you have to buy it to yourself, so I stopped eating sweets.
 
I don’t know, I had like 3 or 4 meals I ate every day:
 
* *Meal 1*:
Classic spaghetti with tomato sauce
* *Meal 2*:
I study in germany in a state called “Baden Württemberg”, so we have these kind of things called “Maultaschen” (like some german ravioli with or without meat) [pic](http://testgiraffe.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC02148.jpg) I sometimes roast them with some vegetables or just boil it in vegetable broth.
* *Meal 3*:
Just rice with peppers or some curry sauce
* *Meal 4* (optional):
Pizza or kebap, mostly when I had no time to cook.
 
 
Oh and I was drinking a lot of alcohol (because when you start studying, you don’t really can't avoid it, at least for me at that time). So my progress wasn’t that much efficient.
 
##Result
[Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/ir7RfJs.png) and [Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/df7WFHS.png) was after YAYOG.
The pictures look not like I progressed from 2014, but consider, that lightning, perspective and posture are playing an essential role when taking fitness pictures. At that moment I don't really had that in mind. Also I was eating just everything, never cared about proteins, fats and calories. Remember *a great body is made in the kitchen, not in the gym*. 
 
I can say that I didn't really progress (in terms of aesthethics) until *the Recommended Routine*. So that's why I said 1,5 years of progress not 2.
 
#2016 April (Recommended Routine)
After roughly 1 year of bodyweight training, I was kinda pleased with myself, but wondered, why I didn’t progress anymore (aesthetically and strength-wise), so I tried to narrow down the reasons and came to a conclusion: I have to change my workout and meal plans.
 
It’s kinda strange that I searched for advise on reddit this late, considering I was on reddit for 3 years at that time. I never thought about searching some “nerdy” website for fitness advices (at that time I didn’t know how diverse reddit could be). 
 
That’s when I stumbled upon the bodyweightfitness forum and I think I can say that changed my life in overall. I found the “Recommended Routine” and a lot more tips regarding your body and diet and so on.
 
##Workout
So I don’t have to say a lot about the recommended routine (link to routine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine))
But I was no beginner, so I started with:
 
 
**Warm-Up: Stretches**  
 
* 10 shoulder rolls
* 10 scapular shrugs
* 10 cat-camels
* 10 band: straight arm overhead pull downs	
* 10 band: straight arm chest flies	
* 10 band: dislocates
* 10 wrist mobility exercises
* 10 front and side leg swings	
 
**Warm-Up: Bodyline Drills**  
 
* 30 sec Plank
* 30 sec Side Plank (each side)
* 30 sec Reverse Plank
* 30 sec Hollow Hold
* 30 sec Arch Hold
 
**Skill Work**  
Oh boy, Handstands were new to me, so I just started with 1-2 minutes:
 
* 2 Min Parallel Bar Support
* 1 Min Handstand Progression (started in a handstand position against the wall, straight)
 
**Strength Work**
 
* 3x6 Pull-Ups
* 3x6 Dips
 
* 10 sec L-Sit (one foot supported) 
* 3x8 Deep Steps
 
* 3x8 Push Ups
* 3x6 Row (feet 90°)
 
This is the routine I did for roughly 5 months, after 3 months I bought rings, which made every exercise harder at the beginning, but now rings are the only equpiment  I’m training with. 
 
##Diet
At that time I was 24 years old, 175cm (5'9""), 75kg (165 lbs).  
That’s were I kinda made a cut through my previous eating behaviour. I calculated my *TDEE* (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) with  
http://www.1percentedge.com/ifcalc/,  
 http://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/ and http://mytdee.com/
 
If I remember correctly i had something like **~2500 kcal/day** to bulk. I was kinda chubby around my belly, but decided to bulk with little phases where I would maintain my weight.
 
What I really were doing was a recomp diet (which I didn’t know at that point). Basically, you eat more on your workout days and maintain/less on your rest days. It is not as effective as the bulk/cut cycle, but is a very slow way to build muscle and lose fat. (correct me if I’m wrong with that)
 
So with that results I searched for food which would meet my requirements:
 
* should be affordable 
* no meat (I’m pescetarian, so some fish is okay) 
* whole foods
 
oh and I just stopped drinking alcohol (just once every 3-4 months)
 
Then I searched for an app to track my calories. I wasn’t satisfied with most apps (including myfitnesspal) but found one which I still use today: It’s called “FDBB” (FooDDatBase)  and it has around 180.000 groceries in its databank, plus custom user inputs. You can scan for barcodes and set to 5 meals a day, track your weight, calculate your daily calorie intake, and so on. I only tested the app here in germany, so I don’t really know how functional this app is outside europe. It’s available in english and german. [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fddb&hl=de), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/fddb-extender-kalorienz%C3%A4hler/id1105332761?mt=8)
 
Then I started making 5 meal times throughout the day to minimize the feeling of being hungry:
 
**Meal 1 (Breakfast ~ 9:00)** (9 am)
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|
|-----------|----|-------|-----|---|
|2x bread|128|4,3g|19,6g|4,9g|
|2x egg|75 |6,5g|0,8g|5,1g|
|10g butter|68|0,1g|0,1g|7,5g|
|50g Harz cheese|61|14,5g|0,1g|0,3g|
|60g salmon|47|5,9g|0g|4,2g|
|**total**|**582**|**33,5g**|**23,4g**|**32g**|
 
 
So you people outside europe maybe wonder: What is that magical harz cheese that has such high amount of protein? I was wondering the same thing. Why we are having such a strong milk and cheese culture and your kinda struggle with finding protein-rich foods? We kinda in protein heaven when it comes down to cheese:
 
* The one called *“Harzer Käse”* or harz cheese is an matured acid-set cheese obtained from cow milk. [This](https://i.imgur.com/Jgygb4Z.jpg) [is](https://i.imgur.com/Tb78vV9.jpg) what it [looks](https://i.imgur.com/eTsWB5S.jpg) like. So 200g are 4x 50g roles of cheese.  Here in germany the harz cheese is kinda loved and hated. Some people say it smells and tastes horrible, others love it (me included) and the last group are fitness people who hates it, but consume it because of proteins. The more it matures, the more it smells and some people like it really fresh with a hard crumbling white core in the middle and I prefer it old and matured, where it has the appearance of a transparent rubber and the consistency of play-doh (okay that sounds weird).
 
* People who don’t like harz cheese but want a cheese with a close amount of protein, there is another cheese called *“Limburger”* (50g have around 93,5g kcal; 13g protein; 0,2g carbs, 4,5g fat). It is nutritions-wise not as good as harzer, but tastes better for some people.
 
* Another lovely protein source is a thing called “Magerquark” or lowfat quark (I don’t really know if that’s the translation). I know there is something like this in the US, but I think the nutrition values are different. It looks like [this](http://imgur.com/A1O26oF) and 500g quark has around 60g of proteins (0,3g fat,4,1g carbs) It is very very cheap, like 70ct per 500g.  It tastes like nothing and is really dry, like a yoghurt without water. It is really hard to eat, so a lot of people just mix it with fruits and milk and other stuff. I always added a little bit of honey and some oat milk (I don’t drink milk) to get it more creamy. 
 
So back to Meal Time:
 
**Meal 2 (Snack 1 ~13:00)** (1 pm)
 
This was my meal after/before my workout:
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|
|-----------|----|-------|-----|---|
|banana|139|1,5g|30g|0,3g|
|myProtein Vanilla Whey Shake|103|20g|1,6g|1,8g|

|10g mustard|9|0,6g|0,6g|0,4g|~~~~
|**total**|**660**|**57,9g**|**18,9**|**17,3g**|
 
It sounds really strange, but Couscous simmered in vegetable broth (or *“Gemüsebrühe”* as we call it) mixed with all that and seasoned with salt, pepper and paprika powder is really okay!
 
##optional:

|**total**|**586**|**47,4g**|**13,7g**|**23,3g**|
 
I must admit, that it sounds really strange, but I kinda like it. It was also a joke for months when my friends and roommates got wind of that. Always had to hear things like “why don’t you add some kidney beans or tuna to your meal?” or  “Do you know what would make the ice cream tastes a lot more better? Sardines and kidney beans”. I’m still known for some strange eating behaviours in terms of food, haha.
 
Back to Meal 4.
 
Before I continue, I love to share with you the best kitchen tool invented in the world (don’t know how it is called in the US) It’s a rice cooker with a steaming attachment (Reiskocher mit Garaufsatz for the germans). So you throw your rice into the pot and place the attachment on top of that cooker. Then you just add your fish/meat/anything into the attachment and put the lid on. The rice boils and the steam cooks the vegetables without loosing the minerals and vitamins. So for my meal the preparation took about 15min and the boiling (where I would do other things) around 30min. So 45 minutes for a top notch meal:
 
**Meal 4 (Dinner ~19:00)** (7 pm)
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|

You see, I didn't really get to the exact 2500kcal/day, but I was in a good range. At that time of my life I didn't really had a clue and was just eating without looking at my weight. (So basically I was just measuring food intake, not my body values). And yes, that was the food I ate every day with some minor changes (f.e instead of salmon I sometimes would eat an avocado). It got a bit repetitive, but I wasn't to strict about it. There were some times (like birthdays or evening with friends) were I was just eating what I got. Don't stress yourself too much about it, from time to time it's okay to eat what you want and not what you need.
 
##Results/Progress
So this is what I looked like after the RR:

[Pic 1 - flexed front](https://i.imgur.com/HpAsstJ.jpg)  
[Pic 1 - flexed side](https://i.imgur.com/vOzrlSy.jpg)  
 
and my progression after the 5 months:
 
**Skill Work**:
 
* 2 Min RTO Support
* 5 Min Handstand Progression (still against the wall)
 
**Strength Work**:
 
* 3x8 L-Sit Pull-Ups (Rings)
* 3x8 L-Sit Dips (Rings)
 
* 40 sec L-Sit 
* 3x8 Deep Steps
 
* 3x8 RTO Push-Ups
* 3x8 Single Arm Row, Legs ~ 100°
 
I was happy with the results, but my goals at this point were more aesthetically so I started with Body By Rings.
 
#2016 Mid August (Body By Rings)
 
So after 5 months of the RR, I decided I just want to look bigger and move on from there towards skill. But I searched for a bodyweight exercises program, to get more muscle mass. I know, to get it done faster, I just could have gone to the gym, but I really love the aspect to build muscles with your own body. Because I was following Daniel Vadnal for quite some time, I thought: *“Hey, he looks pretty big, maybe check out his program.” *
 
*67$* is not cheap, and I struggled a long time with me, buying the program. But in the end I said fuck it and bought it.
 
You get a nice generated mail from Daniel with the download link and that’s it, I was ready to go.
 
Oh, and I started tracking my sets and reps and got me a good timer app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android.timer&hl=de). I don't know why I've never tracked anything, but do it. It will help yourself to see if you're progressing (obviously).
 
As for the timer, I was using the reddit bodyweight fitness app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bodyweight.fitness.free&hl=de), but after changing to BBR, I couldn't use the timer anymore, because of the different workout structure.
 
##Workout
 
I can't really post the full detailed routine, because you know, I paid for that and it wouldn't get Daniel anymore buys but I try my best with the outline.
 
*Body By Rings* is a split plan where you train your **upper body 4 days a week** (5 with legs). That means, *2 Days of Push, 2 Days of Pull* and additionally *1 Leg day*. 
For the leg day, there are no exercises, you have to build your own train day (actually I just used the Leg Exercises video from FitnessFAQs and modified it a bit). And like the name says, you need rings, obviously.
 
So you have 5 weeks of training and 1 week of deload. 
 
**Deload**  
On the deload week you half every set from your exercise but add 10% of intensity. So instead of doing 3x8 Sets you do 1-2x8 Sets with a little bit more intensity.
 
At some point of your workout plan you need a deload week, so your body can recover and build new strength. You lower your sets so the body gets not too stressed but still has to activate some muscles. If you're on a cut, eat at maintenance this week, so your body has enough nutrients to recover.
 
 *Back to BBR*  
Within the BBR Folder there are more informations for all the exercises:
 
* *General Videos*: Just videos explaining some exercise forms
* *Pull Exercise Videos*: All the Pull Exercises shown with progression and common mistakes
* *Push Exercise Videos*: All the Push Exercises shown with progression and common mistakes
* *Track Progress*: The training plan and a weight tracking excel sheet
* *Warmup and Stretches*: just videos of warmup and stretches
* *BBR eBook*: This is where everything you need to know to get started into BBR is explained
 
**Warm Up**
 
As a warm up for my leg day I do this routine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgXH5VGPFVg) and my upper body warm up is a mix of the *Recommended Routine Warm Up* and these videos: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ptcaLJLkeE), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryi0xBaWGu4)
 
The training plan consists of **3 phases**, each phase is 5 weeks of workouts and 1 week of deload. So that means it’s **6 weeks per phase**. The **program itself is set for 18 weeks**, but it says, that if you’re not able to complete the next phase, just do the same phase again. 
 
So I did phase 1 twice, phase 3 three times and right now I’m at [Week Phase].
 
So what does a typical **push day** on phase 2 looks like?
 
* Ring Dip 3-4 Sets, 8-10 Reps
* Archer Pushup, 3-4 Sets, 6-8 Reps L&R 
* Chest Fly, 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps
* Tricep Dip, 3 Sets, 8-15 Reps
* Tricep Extensions, 3-4 Sets, 8-12 Reps
* Diamond Pushup, Feet elevated, 8-15! (Pyramid).
 
On your *Push-Up Days* you train:
 
* Push 1: Triceps, chest, a little bit shoulders
* Push 2: Triceps, Shoulders, a little bit chest
 
On your *Pull-Up Days* you train:
 
* Pull 1: Back, Lats, core, foreams, a little bit biceps
* Pull 2: Back, Lats, forearms, biceps,
 
So as you see, BBR is not set for beginners, I had some troubles coming from the RR, but really got better after some weeks. As for my leg day, I mostly use weights, but I don’t have a rack. So for a long time, I  didn’t really had a consistent leg day, I made the mistake of changing exercises every week, because I wasn’t really pleasured with what I was doing. After making some compromises, this is what my **leg day** looks like:
 
* Goblin Squats, 20kg plate, 3-4 Sets, 10-15 Reps
* Split Squats, 2x20kg dumbbells, 3-4 Sets, 6-10 Reps
* Straight One Leg Calf Raises, 55kg, 3-5 Sets, 10-15 Reps
* Romanian Deadlift, 40kg, 3-4 Sets, 6-10 Reps
* Deadlift, 90kg, 3-4 Sets, 6-10 Reps
 
It’s not perfect yet and when I have the chance to get a rack or a place where I can do front and back squats, I think I change this plan again. Right now, I can’t effectively train my quadriceps.
 
**So the question: was the money worth it?**  
I would say definitely yes. Daniel knows what he’s doing and he created a solid bodyweight program for aesthetic goals. And yes, you could have find all these informations to build a routine like that somewhere on reddit, youtube or bodyweightfitness forums, but at that time of my life, I was so overwhelmed with studying, I didn’t had the time to do that. The program is set for 18 weeks, but I’m now at Week X and you can use the program a lot longer. (There is a progression sheet, which you can use after you finished phase 3 to make your exercises a lot more challenging)
 
And it really helped me showing how a plan could be structured. What muscles group are trained and which exercises should be splitted and it got me more interested in knowing how that plan and especially my body works.
 
All in all, I really got what I expected and I'm a lot stronger to get started with the skill work. (After some months with BBR I could hold a free handstand for ~30 sec although I stopped the skill work part after the RR. And I managed a tuck front planche for ~10 sec)
 
##Diet
When I started with BBR, I didn't really changed my goals in terms of food, because I wanted to bulk , so my diet didn't change until January.
 
#2016 January (Body By Rings)
 
Progress Pics January, both flexed (after 4 months of BBR):  
[Picture 1](https://i.imgur.com/YxGHIHs.png), [Picture 2](https://i.imgur.com/68IzpA7.png)
 
In january I got myself thinking and had the urge to optimize my training and my diet and just everything, so I got more into flexbility and mobility.
 
##Workout
 Until january, I never really was into mobility or flexibility, but after some minor injuries I knew I needed some change. So I found a good mobility and flexibility routine which I do every other day (2-4 times a week) 15min mobility training in the morning and 30min flexbility training in the evening. It's an old routine from Jujimufu, a flexible bodybuilder. I really like the variations of stretching exercises. http://trickstutorials.com/index.php?page=content/flx3
 
It's not for everyone, but If you can stick with it, do it.
 
Furthermore, I started to track my work progress: In BBR you get a track sheet ([example](http://i.imgur.com/HhQNO86.png?1) for push day) for every phase, I extended the sheet by adding a graph to know if I got better over the week. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/6KR573d.png?1) is an example for my push day. I also started to repeat phases of BBR and added weight in some exercises, because I couldn't progress in another way (f.e getting from *Archer Pull-Ups* to *One-Arm Pull-Ups*, right now I'm just doing chin-ups with weight)
 
The last thing I did was getting more into the anatomy of bodyweight training, so I could structure my own plan in the future. I bought a book most of you already know: *Overcoming Gravity 2*. At first I hesitated because of the price, but I think every cent was worth it. So much informations about reps and sets, pacing, injuries, exercises, anatomy of muscle building, yada yada. There are a lot of threads here regarding OG2, so just have a look at that!
 
##Diet
In January I had the urge to cut and to go from 74,5kg (164,2 lbs) to 70kg (154,3 lbs). So I calculated my TDEE and came to about ~1980 kcal/day to cut, then I changed my 5 Meals to 3 Meals a day, because I felt like it. Also my protein intake where kind of high (2g/kg or 0,9/lbs) so I reduced that to 1-1,2g/kg (0,5g/lbs). To this day I never had any problems after that change. My muscles grew and preserved like they should and I had a lot less protein farts (my roommates gladly thanked me for that).
 
So this is what my meal plan looked like:
 
**Meal 1 (Breakfast ~9:00)** (9 am)
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|
|-----------|----|-------|-----|---|
|100g yoghurt 1,5% fat|65|6,9g|9,1g|0,1g|
|150g apple|93|0,8g|20,7g|0,8g|
|60g oatmeal| 224|8,1g|35,2g|4,2g|
|220ml oat milk|97|0,7g|15g|3,3g|
|**total**|**479**|**16,4g**|**80g**|**8,4g**|
 
 
**Meal 2 (Lunch ~14:00)** (2 pm)
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|
|-----------|----|-------|-----|---|
|2x bread|128|4,3g|19,6g|4,9g|
|2x egg|75 |6,5g|0,8g|5,1g|
|10g butter|68|0,1g|0,1g|7,5g|
|50g Harz cheese|61|14,5g|0,1g|0,3g|
|60g salmon|47|5,9g|0g|4,2g|
|**total**|**582**|**33,5g**|**23,4g**|**32g**|
 
**Meal 3 - Salad (Dinner ~20:00)** (8 pm)
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|
|-----------|----|-------|-----|---|
|100g feta cheese|219|20g|1g|15g|
|15ml olive oil|128|0g|0g|13,7g|
|60g rocket salad or arugala|93|0,8g|20,7g|0,8g|
|100g carrots|78|1,6g|13,6g|0,4g|
|75g red pepper|32|1g|4,8g|0,4g|
|80g mushrooms|12|2,2g|0,4g|0,2g|
|10ml balsamic vinegar|10|0g|2,1g|0g|
|60g cherry tomatoes|8|0,5g|1,8g|0,2g|
|**total**|**580**|**26,1g**|**44,4g**|**30,7g**|
 
So my 2 dressings to go are:
*Mustard-Honey-Sauce*:
 
* 30ml olive oil 
* 10ml balsamic vinegar 
* 20ml mustard (1 spoon)
* 10ml honey (1/2 spoon)
* salt and pepper
 
yeah, that is not very exact, just try around until it tastes good.
 
and:
*yoghurt-onion-dressing*:
 
* 30ml olive oil 
* 10ml white vinegar 
* 2-3 spoons of yoghurt
* a little bit of parsley
* onions, chopped finely
* salt and pepper
 
##optional:
 
**Meal 3 - Soup (Dinner ~20:00)** (8 pm)
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|
|-----------|----|-------|-----|---|
|60g cream cheese|146|3,6g|1,7g|13,8g|
|240g cooked potatoes|174|3,1g|36g|0g|
|150g carrots|117|2,4g|20,4g|0,6g|
|75g red pepper|32|1g|4,8g|0,4g|
|100g broccoli|27|3,8g|1,4g|0,4g|
|80g mushrooms|12|2,2g|0,4g|0,2g|
|**total**|**508**|**16,1g**|**64,7g**|**15,4g**|
 
* So you cook the potatoes and carrots in vegetable broth, then just mash everything with an immersion blender or something like that.  
* Then cook the broccoli in a pot and braise the mushrooms lightly in a pan and add it all to the soup. 
* season it with salt, pepper, nutmeg and refine it with cream cheese or gorgonzola
 
In total I get:
 
|food|kcal|protein|carbs|fat|
|-----------|----|-------|-----|---|
|Breakfast|479|16,4g|80g|8,4g|
|Lunch|582|33,5g|23,4g|32g|
|Dinner|580|26,1g|44,4g|30,7g|
|**total**|**1641**|**76g**|**147,8g**|**71,1g**|
|percent|1641|~25,5%|~50%|~24,5%|
 
It's a bit to low for my TDEE, but from there on I just had another good range to work with. I would just add a banana or some protein bars when I felt like it. Or eat more bread or more salad. Your TDEE is just a guidance level. That's when I actively started to measure my weight.
 
BRR had a track sheet, but I found the TDEE 3.0 from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/4mhvpn/adaptive_tdee_tracking_spreadsheet_v3_rescue/) more useful.
I transfered it to Google Drive, made some minor changes, that really helped me to get to know my body and TDEE.

#2017 August (Body By Rings)
**So where am I now?**
This is [me](https://i.imgur.com/CRdpCLM.jpg) right now (7.8.17)
 
I finished my cut (still have a little bit to 10% bf) and going back to maintain. I'm at phase 2 right now, started doing yoga (wanna get more into flexibility) and feel really good about me and my body. I still have to learn a lot of things in terms of bodyweight training, but I think my Trial-and-Error Method brings me there sooner or later. Because I'm doing an internship from September to January, I thought about going to the gym for 3 months. I'm very excited, because it is my first time in the gym. After the 3 months I'm going to build a bodyweight routine focused mainly on aesthetics and a little skill work.
 
 
#Supplements, Problems, Exercises,etc
 
This is the part, where I talk about problems and obstacles I had with training, life, etc. Maybe it will help somebody and shows that no one is really perfectly functional.
 
**Why Bodyweight Training?**  
Yes, In the gym you get much faster results in terms of aesthetics and muscles, but I really like the aspect of exercising everywhere I want. Just pack my rings and I can work my upper body anywhere. It's not as efficient as working out in gym, but I really like the variations and progression of exercises. But to each his own, everyone has different goals!
 
**Diet**  
Keeping your body healthy is essential for a long life, yes. But sometimes you should keep your soul happy too. If you want to eat that chocolate brownie or drink alcohol, do it! Your body maybe won't thank you for that, but that's okay. Just stay within the limits.
 
When you're on a party or with friends and they wanna have a drink, just drink one beer or stay non-alcoholic, they definitely won't kill you for that. And yes, your training may suffer and your calories level rises, so what?  
Just eat less that day and/or make sure you don't have to train the next day. One day isn't gonna reverse all your progress (even one week isn't gonna do that).  
 
Same thing for sweets or big family dinners: Just eat less and be polite about it. When with friends, just eat *some* chips and not all. If you don't make a big fuss about it, no one cares.
 
In the end it all comes back to your soul, if you're not happy, you're body is not happy to. So try to find a good way of keeping them both healthy, don't neglect  the other part.
 
**Training**
 
My goal always was to give it all when exercising, I never let anything get between me and my workout. But sometimes try to think about if it's healthy any more. Don't turn anyone down because you have to train, don't exercise when you feel uncomfortable pain. You know, your workout can be done another day or skipped once, your body can heal and so you can continue to workout. But you can't continue a healthy friendship that way. You can't reverse your injuries by harder training.
 
All in all, if you're not feeling like doing your workout it is okay to skip it *sometimes*.Don't do it everytime, sometimes it's just overcoming your inner laziness. So consider if it's coming home from a long and hard day or just your laziness. The one is an excuse, the other not.
 
You are not a machine and you don't become one, ever. So don't try it all the time, give yourself  some moments to get focused on other important things in your life. Find a good balance between your goals, don't get lost in one goal.
  
**Supplements**  
 
I never really got the hang of most supplements, because I think most of them aren't really necessary for your body. But they won't do any harm to your body either, so each to his own.
 
The only supplements I use are: 
 
* *Protein Powder and Bars*: I think some more protein is useful when you don't hit your daily intake, but don't overdo it.
* *Vitamin D3*: In winter it is hard to get your daily dose of D3 without much sun, so I use vitamin D3 from september until april
* *Fish Oil*: Not everyone gets his daily dose of fish, so sometimes I take one of these, they're cheap too.
 
I considered taking creatine, but I don't see the advantages for me. One of my goals is to look lean and athletic, so I'm not really interested in getting that one extra rep. Also I don't wanna drink that much water, but as I said, all my personal opinions. For a lot of people creatine is helpful and it's cheap. So think about it if you want to progress in your workout!
 
 **Equpiment**  
 
[This](https://i.imgur.com/T45iEeZ.jpg) is my Pull-up bar which I have to this day. It is attached through the wall and strengthened with a wooden plate. As you see, I don't have enough space for one ring, so I just work unilateral exercises (archer push ups) by doing the exercise 8 reps on one side and 8 reps on the other instead of alternating. (should be alternating<same side in terms of progression, but in my case I just hang my rings up higher when doing same side)
 
I also have a dip belt, a barbell bar and 90kg of plates ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/EvibHLd.jpg?1)). I only use the weights for pull-ups, dips, push-ups and Deadlifts.
 
**Plateau**
 
Some day, there will come a time where you don't progress in an exercise. For me it was the *Archer Push-Up* and the *Archer Pull-Up*. What really helped me there was:
 
* *Accumulation*: So basically if you want to reach 24 reps for let's say, your chin-ups, but can't do 3x8 or 4x6, just do 5x5 or 6x4 chin ups. 
It is mostly used for static exercices like hanging or the lever (getting from 4x1min to 2x2min to 1x4min), but it really helped me getting a bit further in progress. Yes your workout gets a bit longer, but for a good reason.
 
* *Adding reps after failure*: So you get to 2x8 but only reach 6 reps in set 3. So what do you do? Wait 15-30 seconds and do some more reps. So you have like 8x8x6+4 = 26, it really helps getting more reps from one session without splitting your sets. I wouldn't do it after every failure and in every exercise, but sometimes it really helps.
 
* *adding weight:* I had a really big problem getting a good rep amount with *Archer Pull-Ups*, so I just did normal *Pull-Ups* with weight until I was strong enough to progress on my Archers.
 
**Motivation**
 
Sometimes it's hard to get yourself up, there were times, where I would skip training because I couldn't go with it. There isn't an universal way, but what me helped, was looking at me and my strength. How I progressed over the months and how I got so much stronger. Who wouldn't want to get stronger, who would say no to that? It's hard work, but you are more then pleasured with what you get out of that, trust me.
 
**Appearance**
 
Tracking everything and making progress in your appearances forces you to look more precisely onto your body. Yes, there are times where you feel skinny again, where you feel fat, where you feel more muscular and where you think you lost some muscles. 
 
First at all, numbers (mostly) can't lie, so If you feel fat again or think you lost some muscles, measure yourself. That's one way to get a grip of your little body dysmorphia. 
 
Second, don't listen too much to yourself, sometimes listen to what others say. There were times I looked in the mirror and really felt unhappy with my body, but the next day someone complemented me how I looked much more muscular. I really felt better about it, hearing another opinion about my body.
 
Third, don't try to compare yourself to others. Genetics are different, not every body works the same way. So don't live up to false expectations, try to find a goal how *you* wanna look like. Don't try to look like someone else. If you have a shortened biceps, that's it, you can't do anything about it. Find a way around it, workout your triceps more or just try to wear shirts that fit in a good way. You can't become another person, so don't try it.
 
Try to think reasonable and healthy about your body. I know it's not easy all the time, but look at old photos or think about how you looked before you worked out. Compare yourself with your past-you, not with other people. See what great achievements you have made in life. How your body changed, how you changed. That's all what counts!
 
#End of Post
 I'm at the end of my post and it was longer than I expected, oh boy. I don't really know what to say, so if you have questions just ask. I have to say I'm really glad I found this subreddit and I must admit,this subreddit had a bigger influence to my life than I ever imagined. Thanks!!!"
What are excercises/stretches that should be done daily to prevent problems when I'm older?,Gaurav_Shinde,770,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4lr374/what_are_excercisesstretches_that_should_be_done/,1464635523.0,"Currently a 17 year old. I see over 2 hours worth of stretches that should be done ""daily"" on this sub but I dont have time for that. There are different gmb.io routines and videos of youtube.

As a young person, I want to prevent back problems, arthritis, tight hips, and etc when I'm older. I currently do all the warm-up and bodyline drills here everyday and upper-body work. But there arent really any routines that strengthen legs and lower back.

So I'm asking, is there a short list or video of routine that can be done daily to prevent problems later?"
"PSA: Improving your handstand hold isn’t just about squeezing everything and hoping for the best. You have to know how to make micro-adjustments, which is why the heel pull & toe pull exercises are so important for handstand training.",stickysweetastytreat,773,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/iwlgr5/psa_improving_your_handstand_hold_isnt_just_about/,1600633400.0,"This is by far the most common feedback I give for people stuck on increasing handstand hold times: Increasing your handstand time isn't just about squeezing everything as hard as you can and hoping for the best.

Yes, body tension is important, but it isn’t the full story. Even when you’re standing on your feet, you can’t stay upright for long if you don’t allow yourself to make micro-adjustments, right? Try it-- stand up and make it a point to not change anything about how your muscles are engaged. You will eventually start to drift.

So why would this work in a handstand? It won’t.

This is why the **heel pull** and **toe pull** exercises are so important. They’re not just exercises to help you build something; they are literally how you maintain your balance in a handstand (as long as you maintain enough tension through the rest of your body).

When you start to feel yourself falling back too far, you drive your fingertips into the floor to help counter that backwards fall. When you start to feel yourself starting to fall back down to your feet, you drive through the heels of your hands to help boost yourself back up. (note that this is usually the harder correction, especially if you have tight shoulders)

These are linked in the sidebar, but here they are again:

heel pull - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYehg2ruMN0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYehg2ruMN0)

toe pull - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-7QXCsPL0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-7QXCsPL0) 

Rules & Recommendations:

* Working on this at the wall is recommended because you don’t have to keep going through the hassle of coming all the way back down & getting back up after one rep. Of course it's helpful to try in a freestanding handstand, but if you really want to drill these, use the wall.
* The closer your hands are to the wall, the easier the exercise is since there’s less distance you need to account for. Also, there’s no shame in getting right up on the wall! It's better to learn how it feels, than to just make the exercise hard for the sake of it being hard, especially if you don't really know what you're shooting for. (This is one way that handstands are awesome for mindfulness & body awareness!)
* Minimize the boosting, hitching, bouncing etc off the wall with your legs/feet, or creating momentum through tucking your pelvis or squeezing your butt to bring yourself off the wall. It detracts from the point of the exercises. Instead, think of it like “peeling” yourself off the wall from the ground up. It will probably feel impossible at first.
* You will probably feel this in your forearms, especially heel pulls.

&#x200B;

Eventually, you will dial in the amount/intensity of these corrections so you're not ping-ponging between over-corrected heel & toe pulls.

Btw, this is also why it’s important to keep your weight centered over your *knuckle line*, and NOT the heels of your hands, even though that’s what feels the most stable in the short-term.

 Edit 2: so I decided to do a quick 3 min squats, 3 min push ups, plank workout to test myself, and 8 hours later had full blown Rabdo. Here are some points to note on this not fun journey of mine.. 


1: Iv always been a ""Fittish person"", I'd say my physical level is a strong intermediate

2: haven't really pushed myself the last uear due to lockdown so this was my first time going ""all out"" in over 12 months

3: First sign this wasn't doms was the extreme, constant PAIN in everything between my knees and my lower back. It was a constant sharp/dull/cold/burning/throbbing/stabbing/trembling etc pain that was going on all at once, even when I wasn't moving. At least with doms its wore when u move or when you touch it, this was just constant pain PERIOD. ANY TOUCH INCREASED IT 10X, yet it still tried walking and foam rolling.(no affect)

4: symptoms of pain started over the span of 30 seconds, approx 8 hours after workouta and didn't let up.

5:I went to the hospital when I realized my pee was turning a dark color, which it did the next day, pain was still at same level.

6: went to ER, the admitted me to icu, gave me some pain killers which didn't work, then gave me some REAL painkillers which were supposed to be instant, but still took about 30 min to work.

7: over the next 3 days my CPK levels went up to 180,000. I was peeing around 17 liters a day, which is a mix of drinking and IV. I was on a cath due to the heavy pee amounts, but my CPK still rose till it didn't.

8: became a write-up case in the hospital because of the weird nature of my case, where I had super CPK levels,was passing a ungodly amount of urine, but all my other levels were absolutely fine. No liver, no kidney, no electrolytes, no chemical imbalances.

9: 1/10 wouldn't reccomend.

10: day 5 out of er and in a normal room, my CPK levels are now around 40K, expected to drop to 10k over the next 2 days.

**Training super intensely once per week is enough to make significant strength and muscle gains.**

* To do this, make sure you go to absolute failure safely on a few core exercises.
* Make every rep *as difficult as possible*.

\-----------------------

Hi all,

Over the last couple of years, I've talked to many people about my high-intensity, low-frequency (HILF) approach to strength training.

I've had [really good results](https://www.notion.so/So-Many-Gains-So-Little-Time-Effective-Strength-in-Minimal-Time-Version-1-0-d6a8b7cd00e748dc948b4147cec3b6a7#110b09c5b9a44cedb99925cfd14e5dc4) with it, both in terms of strength and hypertrophy, training now just once per week.

Quite a few have expressed interest in trying it.

Aside from walking them through the approach one at a time, I've had no consolidated reference I could point them to, given the disparate sources I've synthesized the methodology from. Hence, I finally wrote [this summary](https://andras.is/jacked). I wrote it primarily for friends, but I think it could be broadly useful to the Bodyweight Fitness Community.

**Read the guide over and please ask any questions. I'm still working to actively improve and clarify the guide to make it more useful, so any feedback is appreciated.**

The dand works the hell out of the shoulders and triceps while also activating parts of the back as well as the chest. There are a large number of variants as well such as the ram murti push ups which slows the range of motion



Anybody with strength goals should do them

A year ago I never dreamed of repping one arm pullups...,Ronan_SW,767,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n4nosq/a_year_ago_i_never_dreamed_of_repping_one_arm/,1620133009.0,"A year ago a OAP felt like kt would never be achievable... But today I reached [3 one arm pullups](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODc4OTcyMjMyMTczMjg4?story_media_id=2566163385251872977&igshid=16835xcv4r88z) on my right side, and 5 on my left. They’re not perfect form but hey - we’re improving! 

Tips for those of you chasing the one arm pullup:

* weighted pull ups. These are (in my experience) BY FAR the best  exercise for getting the hardcore pulling strength required for the one arm pull up. For reference, I got my first (shoddy) one arm pull up at a +60% pull up, and I’ve just recently reached +80%.

* archer pull ups on rings. I found these great for exposing yourself to the mechanics and weight distribution required for the OAP. I find they put a lot more stress on the bicep, so they probably carry over better to the OAC. Once i got close to the OAP i dropped them entirely for weighted pull up.

* one arm scapula shrugs. These are great for building the anti-rotational and scapula strength required. Also good for grip gains. 

* avoid negatives (to begin with). Negatives gave me tendonitis on a few occasions over the year. Once I took the ego hit and accepted they were too tough to get adequate volume, my progress sky rocketed.

* don’t overtrain. I do 2 pull sessions a week. I only include one arm pulling work in 1 of these sessions to ensure I’m recovering fast enough. Don’t underestimate the stress OAP puts on your tendons!

Do you feel chin-ups build the back as well as pull-ups?,thebigeverybody,757,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/my8t3i/do_you_feel_chinups_build_the_back_as_well_as/,1619359049.0,"I've always thought that pull-ups were the superior back builder, mainly because I feel like they target more of the upper back muscles.

People who practice high tension and muscle control, like Matt Schifferle, will certainly advocate that it's all the same muscles being used and you control whether or not the pull-up is superior by your efforts to generate tension. And he's right, but my tension efforts fail on chin-ups because it's so much easier to ""break the bar"" on pull-ups.

ANYWAYS, I just found this article that has me wondering about whether or not pull-ups truly do stimulate the back more:

https://outlift.com/chin-ups-vs-pull-ups/

The gist of the article is that he claims that studies showing pull-ups stimulating more back muscles are based on a one repetition effort, but if you rep chin-ups to failure (or near failure), which is how most of us train, you get just as much stimulation as repping pull-ups to failure (or near failure).

I'm not sure if I agree or disagree. I've always felt chin-ups didn't work the back as well, even taken to failure, but maybe my form is off  or maybe it's all in my mind.

Thoughts?

EDIT here's the most interesting part of the article. You should check out the entire thing because it's got charts and studies.

>So what we’re seeing is that chin-ups work our biceps 52% harder and pull-ups work our lats 14% harder… right? Yes, but only if we’re talking about doing a single bodyweight repetition of either exercise. The thing is, that’s now how we train for muscle growth. If we’re doing bodyweight chin-ups and pull-ups, we need to bring our sets close to failure, and since we’re stronger at chin-ups, we can do more repetitions. And if we’re adding weight, we can add more weight to our chin-ups.
>
>So what’s happening with these bodyweight exercises is that with chin-ups, the load is shared more evenly between our lats and biceps. And because our biceps are helping, the lift becomes easier, and less load is put on our lats. When we do more repetitions or add more weight, though, then because both of these muscles are sharing the load more evenly, we bring both of them closer to failure, stimulating more overall muscle growth.
>
>For example, in Dr Contreras’s case, he was able to do chin-ups with 90 pounds around his waist, pull-ups with 45 pounds. At that point, because of the heavier weights being used, both exercises worked his lats equally hard. After all, his lats were the limiting factor in both of them, meaning that they’ll get most of the growth stimulus regardless. What’s interesting, though, is that the chin-up went from working the biceps 53% harder to working them 60% harder."
"Strength & Hypertrophy Training: A Programming Guide - The very basics of strength/hypertrophy training and how to design your own effective, research based resistance training program.",SamStephens,757,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qfqgk1/strength_hypertrophy_training_a_programming_guide/,1635196107.0,"Hi everyone.

I wrote a research based educational guide on resistance training for my own personal training clients that I thought might be helpful to some of you here. This is essentially every bit of info that I’d want to teach a new client within the first few months of training, all laid out in an easy to follow format.  

[https://fitstra.com/strength-hypertrophy-training/](https://fitstra.com/strength-hypertrophy-training/)

While I personally lean a little more towards free weights than bodyweight exercises, there are a ton of shared training principles between the two styles of resistance training that apply to all of us. The guide linked above dives into topics like motor unit recruitment, fiber activation, muscle protein synthesis stimulation, progressive overloading and periodization, and many other basic concepts that could be helpful to your own routine and your fitness progress.

TLDR of the guide:

>Strength – a controlled display of  force that’s specific to a task and to the person performing it.  Hypertrophy – the growth of new muscle tissue that improves our size and  functional capabilities.  
>  
>To  improve strength and hypertrophy, lifters beyond the beginner phase  should follow a basic periodized program that allows each muscle group  to be targeted 2-3 times per week with at least 48 hours of rest between  same muscle stimulation, for a total of 4-6 workouts per week. This  routine maximizes muscle protein synthesis throughout the week,  stimulates the muscles with a consistent amount of stress/damage needed  for growth, and allows for at least 24 hours of CNS rest between  workouts.  
>  
>For equipment, I recommend that your workouts  utilize primarily barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, suspension trainers,  and your own bodyweight. These tools offer a wide variety of movement  options and training styles while remaining constant in their  availability and function from gym to gym. Learning to use these  standard pieces of equipment will provide you with the best training  foundation to scale your workouts as you progress in ability.  
>  
>Within the suggested weekly workout frequency listed above, 6-12+ total sets for a single muscle/movement should be performed per week.  60-70% of these sets should focus on hypertrophy and the remaining  30-40% need to target strength. This split gives us enough hypertrophy  volume to grow new tissue and while allowing for plenty of strength work  to improve force output/neuromuscular coordination.  
>  
>Inter-set  rest times of 1.5-3 minutes should be used when training for  hypertrophy and 3-5 minutes for strength. More rest allows us to lift  more weight and more weight leads to greater progress. Improvements to  work capacity due to smart cardiovascular training can keep rest times  low – do cardio for more gains.  
>  
>Regarding reps, studies  show that strength gains are primarily made when we lift at or above  80-85% of our 1RM, while hypertrophy can occur within a broad spectrum  of loads. These percentages correspond to rep ranges of roughly 1-6 for  strength and 6-12+ for hypertrophy – I suggest capping your hypertrophy  work at 12 reps.  
>  
>In all rep ranges, set failure should be avoided  when possible – leave 1 rep in reserve most of the time. Aim for a rep  tempo of 1-2 seconds in the concentric phase and 2-3 seconds in the  eccentric. Control every rep, don’t let them control you.  
>  
>To keep  both CNS and PNS fatigue from interfering with workout productivity,  start with strength, transition into hypertrophy, and then end with  cardiovascular conditioning. This setup places the most high volume and  fatigue inducing exercises at the end and allows us to maximize our  strength/hypertrophy training potential before we get too tired. If your  workout contains any significant amount of power work, do it first.

An interesting Athlean X take on planks,idiotpathic,753,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bagnsj/an_interesting_athlean_x_take_on_planks/,1554646629.0,"https://youtu.be/ZyWEXjdAGCQ

Longtime lurker here. I recently watched this regarding planks. It's an interesting perspective that appears to make some valid points on the limitations of this frequently lauded exercise. First, Jeff Cavaliere notes that it only works the abs in one plane, the sagittal plane, as opposed to different sides, rotation, etc. Additionally, instead of glute and posture strengthening, the hip flexors are actually activated. When the glutes are contracted at the top of a plank, they are not contracted under load, so it's not as effective. Because it works the hip flexors, too much strengthening/tightening could cause low back issues. And finally, in terms of posture, the contractions of the rhomboids and traps at the top of a plank are essentially unloaded, so again, not as effective 

Ultimately, he mentions that in order to actually get the claimed benefits of a plank, one should do reverse planks. This way, you can progressively overload the posterior chain. Beginners can start by performing it on a bench, then ultimately transition to a full reverse plank on the floor.

"Is alcohol really that bad for training? How alcohol effects health, fat loss, and muscle growth. It's kind of surprising",CommonReview,752,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/e7sxrb/is_alcohol_really_that_bad_for_training_how/,1575806287.0,"https://leangains.com/the-truth-about-alcohol-fat-loss-and-muscle-growth/

Its an older article by Martin Berkhan (leangains guy if you remember), but the information has held up to today and its pretty informative



**Disclaimer: This post and all of the data is regarding MILD, responsible drinking.** If you're pounding down wild turkey on the daily you will not see positive health effects (trust me i'd know)

**Alcohol and calorie burn**:
- Alcohol has 7.1 calories per gram on paper, but it has the highest thermic effect of food (TEF) and as a result contains more along the lines of 5.7 calories

- Statistically, drinkers weight less then non-drinkers. This has a couple of possible mechanisms, including long term decreases in food intake and improvement in nutrient partitioning
- Despite this, Alcohol has very little satiety effects, as a matter of fact it often leads to disinhibition causing you to eat more junk (3:00 AM drunk IHOP, anyone?)

**Alcohol: insulin sensitivity and overall health**

-  Moderate alcohol consumption impoves insulin sensitivity, lowers serum triglyceride, and improves blood glucose in both healthy individuals and even people with type 2 diebetes. Possible mechanisms include stimulation of AMPK (an enzyme that is activated, notably during aerobic training, to activate blood glucose and fatty acid oxidation when cellular energy is low)
- Moderate drinkers live longer then non-drinkers. 
- Alcohol can protect against many different diseases and ailments as well. 


**Alcohol and hormones**
- Limited data suggests that alcohol can reduce testosterone, but it was a mere 8% for some very very heavy drinking (3 beers per day for 3 weeks) so it seems the effect is minimal.
- Intense training sessions, large acute alcohol intakes, or both, are the only instances that see large reductions in testosterone in healthy individuals.
- One rat study suggests negative effects on protien synthesis...But do note that rat studies arent exactly high quality evidence.

**Alcohol and fat storage**

- Alcohol gets immediate priority for energy use by the body, this means fat and carb mobilization will be suppressed.
- Limited data suggests that the conversion of alcohol to fat via de novo lipogenesis is minuscule at most
- The effect of alcohol on fat storage is similar to carbs. When you drink alcohol, you aren't burning fat, so all of the fat that you DO eat will assuredly get stored.


**Discussion:**

- Do you drink? How much? 

- Do you ever drink after training?

- Have you started drinking moderately, or quit drinking entirely, and noticed any differences in gym performance and gains?


Personal note: Just because of the positive effects alcohol has on health doesn't mean its always a good idea for everyone. For instance my dad had issues with drinking and many in my extended family do as well, i'm more of an abstainer then a moderator. For me, its a better choice to minimize drinking despite all of this."
HOW TO GET FLEXIBLE IF YOU ARE SUPER BUSY CHALLENGE,heweijun8,752,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/75ymot/how_to_get_flexible_if_you_are_super_busy/,1507830059.0,"**THE FLEXIBILITY EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE RULE:**

Incorporate flexibility anywhere and everywhere 


* Requires no will power
* Easy to implement
* Lasts forever
* Primed to perform for your workout
* Easier to warm up and get in the zone 


The point of this is to move or hold ranges that promote better flexibility.  If you can do these low intensity movements / holds and make them part of your normal everyday, you will get more comfortable, stronger and that will transfer to your performance.  Flexibility work likes repetition, the more you do it, the easier it gets, even if it’s stubborn.


Some Examples

**NO CHAIR RULE**

* Lunge (forward or side)
* Horse stance 
* Wide stand 
* Tall kneel

[Positions at Desk](http://thedaoofaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1361.jpg)
[Everyday movement](http://thedaoofaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1372.jpg)


I use old sofa cushions to soften the floor, and I change positions often.  I also move my hips in different ranges where I feel a comfortable stretch.

**BOOBY TRAPS**

I strategically place my dumbbells close to my desk.  I can pick it up to do a weighted stretch, or hold it overhead to build strength in my shoulders.   I don’t have to think about whether I feel like it or not I just do it.

[Dumbbell booby trap](http://thedaoofaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1352.jpg)

**RESULTS FROM WEEK 1**

* Adductors less tight and less pain
* Arrive at practice already primed and my warm up is easier
* I moved from 20 inches to 19 inches from the ground in middle split
* 11 inches to 10 inches in right leg split
* Addicted to the habit and feeling of stretching 


Be creative with this, and have your movements aligned with your goals.  The above are 3 examples I use for my own purposes.  Have fun!

Is creatine worth it?,SpiritualSlay,751,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/u616ie/is_creatine_worth_it/,1650244546.0,"So I’m beginning my fitness journey and starting to consistently workout and everything, and as a result I’ve been looking into a lot of things online in terms of knowledge and I came across creatine.

I’ve purchased protein powder to help with ensuring I take enough protein daily and I was wondering if I should order creatine with it.

I’ve seen the accounts of what creatine does and how it’s perhaps the best supplement not only for the aesthetics of the muscles but for the performance as well and I’ve heard that it’s a huge game changer in terms of what I just spoke about so it’s something I would definitely want to include if it can help my health and quality of well-being.

I do have an issue, though: the DHT increase.

My hair is a big part of me, I have a large, curly and coarse afro that I’ve been growing out for 5+ years, and it’s definitely something I would like to keep until I choose not to change it on my own accord. So if taking creatine is going to speed along the process of me losing that autonomy when it comes to my hair, I wouldn’t want to take it.

So, with all of that being said, I’m just seeking knowledge on if it’s going to cause that much of a difference for someone who is just using body weight exercises, and if it is going to dramatically impact my results is there any way to completely offset the DHT increase creatine seems to cause?

I’m sorry if this question is asked in this community a lot, I haven’t seen it since I’ve been here and this is a valuable concern in my eyes, thank you for reading. 👍🏼"

Legs and lower body calisthenics are not used to their full potential. Here's a detailed analysis.,RockRaiders,744,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7jcxih/legs_and_lower_body_calisthenics_are_not_used_to/,1513104392.0,"**Edit: [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7z88wg/legs_and_lower_body_calisthenics_v2_a_comparison/) has updated information on exercise progressions and a better routine, it does not contain the theory section below though.**

**TL;DR: there are some underused exercises that can build the quads and hamstrings to advanced levels without added weight. The glutes and spinal erectors (lower back) are still probably too strong to make good gains past a certain level without extra load. I want to show you some possibilities and promote discussion.**

**THEORY:**

**(if not interested check out the next section about exercises including uncommon ones, or an example routine at the bottom)**

The **best exercises to build the lower body musculature and increase maximal strength are the ones that can be progressed gradually and without becoming unpractical or too easy past a certain point**. The best candidates are the **compound free weight lifts like squat and deadlift and glute bridge variations**.

This post is to talk about the **options for those who don't have access to a squat rack or a lot of weight, or who don't have access to equipment at all** (working out at a park without people or rocks etc. to use at weight, people confined to a cell etc.).

**If you can, use your dumbbells or create improvised weights like bags full of stuff**, sand is probably the cheapest option that is space-efficient.

To increase load on muscles without resorting to added weight, we have to use **leverage** (changing body position so that the distance from a joint to the center mass of what it has to lift increases, requiring more force from the muscles to rotate that joint), **unilaterality** (forcing one side of the body to take partial or full load) and **[the muscle length-tension relationship](https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Active-length-tension.png?resize=1024%2C550&ssl=1)** (placing the muscle in more lengthened or contracted positions to ~~require more force from it to create torque on a joint~~ edit: the force required is the same but since the contractile protein of the muscles (inside their little ""engines"") is in a [worse overlap](http://slideplayer.com/slide/8500309/26/images/44/Stretch:+Length-Tension+Relationship.jpg) compared to the resting length, the muscles will have to contract more often or more efficiently).

In squat variations, leverage is distributed between the hips and the knees depending on body lean and knee, hip and ankle angles. Since the center mass is under the midfoot when the heel is flat, [here](http://www.powerliftingtowin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lowvshigh.jpg) is how these angles affect the effort required from the hips and knees. This applies to single leg squats too, as I'll explain later.

Exercises can be made partially unilateral (lunges, split squats, side to side/Cossack squats etc.) or fully unilateral (pistol, shrimp, deep step up, single leg hinge exercises etc.). Unilaterality can introduce a big **stability** challenge, mostly due to weakness in the gluteus medius (outer glute, stabilizes the hip orientation) and the intrinsic foot muscles (they create the foot's arch/tripod position, which makes the foot and ankle stable). This instability can also be present in bilateral exercises and it puts the knee joint in a bad alignment (the optimal one is knee parallel to the middle toes), causing knee stress and pain with time.

A solution can be holding an object for balance assistance while doing an unilateral exercise until you improve your stability.

The other challenge is **mobility**. The most common limitation is **ankle dorsiflexion**, the ability to close the angle of the shin and the foot, which makes the knee travel forward and prevents you from falling on your ass in any deep squat exercise. This can be corrected with bent knee calf stretches or compensated with heel elevation through a ramp or a wedge or weightlifting shoes etc. 

Some individuals will never be able to achieve a flat footed deep single leg squat without heel elevation if their anatomy (short torso, long femur, short tibia) or [anterior ankle impingement](http://physioworks.com.au/injuries-conditions-1/anterior-ankle-impingement) (sometimes treatable, sometimes not) is the problem.

Another possible limitation is **glute inflexibility** if you can't bring the knee to your chest, or in bilateral squats **adductor inflexibility**, which prevents you from pushing your knees out for proper knee tracking if your stance is wide. These limitations can be addressed with mobility work, but your **hip socket anatomy** may prevent you from reaching full depth in some stances.

A lack of mobility can cause **ankle overpronation** as a compensation (losing the foot's arch to gain some ankle range of motion), which puts stress on the knee, or **back rounding** (also known as butt wink) as the torso bends forward to create a counterweight. Repeated flexion of the lumbar spine under load, or even with bodyweight load if for very high volume, can damage the spine over time. In pistol squats, **hamstring inflexibility** of the free leg can cause back rounding too (because posterior pelvic tilt makes up for hip flexion), but just by standing on an elevated surface and letting the free leg drop this can be solved.

Having addressed these challenges, leg exercises can be classified depending on where in their range of motion the hardest point is.

**Stretch exercises** are those where the muscles have to overcome a significant lever arm while lengthened. For example in deep squats the glutes and quads are stretched at the bottom so they are weaker, that is why the sticking point of a squat is in coming out of the hole. 

**Contraction exercises** are those where the hardest point is near the muscle's full flexion point. This also reduces the tension a muscle can produce according to the strength curve.

These two exercise types together load the muscles through a full range of motion.

Edit: note that strength is quite specific to the ranges of motion trained, so if you are not a soccer player or martial artist or rock climber etc., the end range of stretch exercises may carry over less to your activities.

**EXERCISES:**

If you only have your bodyweight and maybe a small amount of extra weight, to make good use of it you'll have to ""divide and conquer"" the lower body, since together its mass is too strong to be challenged after a certain point. So these exercises are classified depending on which is the primary muscle worked, but some variations are quite balanced and will also work the other muscles, while other variations mostly isolate one muscle.

The most measurable progression methods are probably **range of motion** and **leverage**.

**Quadriceps:**

Here the main factor that increases difficulty is how far forward the knees travel over the toes, since it increases the lever arm on the joint. This is not necessarily bad and the old myth about not allowing the knees to pass the toes is [bullshit](https://squatuniversity.com/2016/01/29/can-the-knees-go-over-the-toes-debunking-squat-myths/), but when they travel forward a lot you may need time to strengthen the tissues gradually, just like the elbows in muscle ups. If you already have significant knee problems you may need to limit the amount of travel you allow. Also remember that proper knee tracking (knees aligned with toes) is still necessary to prevent knee valgus pain.

*Stretch exercises:*

* Deep single leg squats have your quads and glutes stretched at the bottom. So pistols, foot elevated shrimps and deep step ups. To make them more quad dominant, eliminate the possible forms of counteweight: tuck the free leg ([tuck squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQZ-ZbdVxm8)) or even bring it behind your body (shrimp squats, deep step ups), put the arms on your chest or behind you (for example advanced shrimps where one or both hold the free foot), keep the torso more upright. If ankle mobility limits you, use a counterweight (also good for allowing a neutral spine) or elevate your heel on an object or by staying on your toes (the second option may be worse because it's harder to balance).
* [Sissy squats](http://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWSissySquat.html), where you stay on your toes and let your knees travel forward as much as comfortable. A wall may be used to regulate knee forward travel. There is a [partially unilateral variation](https://youtu.be/7qxx40ieV6M?t=1m34s) but I haven't seen anyone do them fully single leg. It may be possible but awkward to balance and to maintain knee tracking. These can be made harder by allowing less hip hinge, this will put more stretch on the quads. A single leg sissy with zero hinge is theoretically the hardest possible quad stretch exercise.
* [Kneeling leg extensions](https://youtu.be/7qxx40ieV6M?t=43s), which put a lot of stretch on the quads. Depth is a progression method and keeping the arms to the sides or behind you increases the lever arm. No hip hinge makes this harder. A single leg version would be even harder but it doesn't look practical.
* **Ultimate quad stretch exercise**: [elevated advanced shrimp squat with heel lift](https://www.facebook.com/portal.ido/posts/548255915216393). A single leg kneeling extension or sissy squat with no hinge may be harder but I haven't seen it done. If you have access to some weights, pistols on an elevated surface (so the free leg can stay lower) and a counterweight (or heel elevation) are the most mobility-simplified full range exercise.

*Contraction exercises:*

* [Anchored leg extension](https://youtu.be/1egn6D4T82E?t=18s): this is not very practical to set up, except if you stay closer to the ground, I have done it with a park bench but it may break. Here the difficulty can be scaled with the amount of hip hinge and by extending the arms behind. The top part is the hardest because you are fully extended perpendicular to gravity. If a single leg version of this can be done, it would be the hardest quad exercise possible.
* [Knee extension from plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKNZiXwmz-g): can also be done double leg. I have tried this a few times and after 10 reps I felt a nice quad burn. Not sure if it's very healthy long term, I haven't tried it much and it requires accurate knee tracking.
* **Ultimate quad contraction exercise:** If it is possible, a single leg anchored extension with straight body from knees to head and arms behind you. The knee extension from plank can be done with zero equipment though. Honestly I don't think you actually need a quad contraction exercise at all.

**Glutes:**

*Stretch exercises:*

* Single leg squats where you lean forward a lot with your torso and extend your arms forward will allow you to sit back more and the knee will not travel forward much, so the hip lever arm will be longer and it's easy to get full hip flexion even without a lot of ankle mobility. Here hamstring mobility may limit you and you need good knee tracking. Pistol squats when you barely have the ankle mobility will tend to be this kind of exercise, but quite balanced between glutes and quads. The glute dominant variation is the [single leg deadlift](https://youtu.be/qeltWRGEX9U?t=48s), unfortunately without weight it quickly loses its challenge. 

*Contraction exercises:*

* Glute bridges are the best example of this. To do them right and reduce hamstring assistance, you need full hip extension and posterior pelvic tilt at the top with a vertical shin. These can be made harder with a single leg and by elevating the shoulders (hip thrust) and optionally the feet too. Elevation increases the range of motion and makes the body horizontal at lock out, so you are perpendicular to gravity and the load is maximized. Unfortunately even the elevated single leg version won't last very long. But it's a good exercise to load with extra weight. At home some pillows may be needed to cushion the hips from the pressure of added load. /u/iAznN00b has suggested doing these on progressively longer ring straps to increase the difficulty just like ring pushing is harder, but I don't have experience with this. [Example on rings](https://youtu.be/LFvZ-d4rDac?t=2m49s).

As a bonus, glute bridges done properly can gradually correct anterior pelvic tilt.

So you can see that **the glutes, being one of the strongest and biggest muscles in the body (only the lats can rival them), quickly get too strong for bodyweight only**. 

**Hamstrings**:

Here I don't think there is much need to separate them into contraction and stretch categories, since the quad and glute dominant exercises give them some stimulus, and one hamstring dominant exercise can be enough. With bodyweight you may never run out of challenge, as you'll see below.

* Glute bridges with a straighter leg or less posterior pelvic tilt: if your shin is horizontal at the top and you don't engage the glutes by tilting the pelvis, you will feel these mostly in the hamstrings.
* Sliding or suspended hamstring curls: with one or two legs, you can use a furniture slider or socks on a smooth surface or rings or trx straps. The floor single leg version is quite challenging and easy to load with some weight or more friction. Maintaining full hip extension makes them harder. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN1ci4BYTUE) is an example of single leg with more friction. This is the most available hamstring exercise, just needs somewhere to slide or suspend yourself. Can also be done on a stability ball.
* Glute ham raise and Nordic curl (aka Russian curl, natural hamstring curl, Harop curl): if you can anchor yourself under something this is the ultimate progression. The easiest version is [just a hip hinge](https://youtu.be/GHepEe_WZYg?t=11s) while the hardest is [arms forward and no hip hinge](https://youtu.be/V3yUYMFlJ54?t=9s). I have written a detailed post on this exercise 's progressions and where to do it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7f1u6e/nordic_hamstring_curls_are_the_ultimate/).
* If you have inversion boots, you can do [upside down squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nqnIlZfm-Q). I haven't seen a single leg version, it may be the most challenging version. Also if you hinge less and extend your arms it should be harder. I haven't seen this either.

Sliding curls are the most available choice, Nordic curls are a bit harder to set up but amazing. The **ultimate hamstring exercise** is probably the single leg Nordic curl or the single leg inverted squat with no hinge, but I'm not sure one can ever become strong enough. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RBAstMjbNU)'s 16 strict Nordic curls with two legs for reference. A rare display of relative strength.

Edit: if you have a decline bench, [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHInsiQlzgc) of the GHR or Nordic curl is harder than on a horizontal surface.

**Lower back/spinal erectors:**

Here you either train back extension dynamically with [extensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnjXAAr29Lc) or [reverse hyperextensions](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/GluteusMaximus/BWReverseHyperextension.html), or statically with [shoulder reverse planks](https://youtu.be/4qtFuTu-FQA?t=21s). All of these exercises soon become easy, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqjf4kRV04Q)'s a guy bridging with 210lbs/95kg. Adding weight will be worthwhile. 

Edit: in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7jcxih/legs_and_lower_body_calisthenics_are_not_used_to/dr6coh0/) there are more ideas: [back lever reverse hyper](https://youtu.be/jKXicOT7aYg?t=47), [suspension or rings hyperextension](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/STHyperextension.html) and reverse hypers with less of the body supported (no video example and it may be dangerous for the spine).

Back levers and planches and press handstands also require back strength but nowhere near heavy squats and deadlifts or these isolation exercises. However gymnasts can often do well on their first squat and deadlift without previous direct training ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcO9yc3R5tM)), but keep in mind that the landings from tumbling are like heavy eccentric deadlifts, so your average street workout athlete won't have the same experience.

Finding a place for reverse hypers is simple, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeRsNzFcQLQ)'s a good video by /u/fitnessfaqs.

**Calves:**

There are two muscles, soleus and gastrocnemius. The former is strong with straight knees and the latter with bent knees. To train these do calf raises with one or two legs, preferably on a stair you you can get full range of motion with a slow eccentric and a pause at the bottom, or you'll just use the elastic energy of the Achilles tendon. If you have short muscle bellies you probably won't grow much, while if you have good calf genetics you'll grow well even with low loads if you do high volume. Also just doing sports, running, jump roping etc. can grow the calves.

**Adductors and abductors:**

These are mostly trained for stability and compound movements will already stimulate them, especially single leg ones. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm4etEeE9Cg) are some isolation exercises if you want.

**CONCLUSION:**

So we've seen that the quad and hamstring bodyweight potential is underrated, while the glutes and lower back can be trained to an intermediate strength level but after that it will be mostly endurance. The calves depend on genetics and high volume of low intensity can work to grow them.

**How do we squeeze the most out of an easy exercise for muscle growth?**

If there are no harder variations to train, we can increase the total volume (more sets), frequency (more training sessions) and density (less rest) and always go to failure or close so [all the muscle motor units still get recruited](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/), or do [rest-pause training](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/rest_pause_training_methods.htm). It may work for hypertrophy (and as a consequence slightly increase maximal strength) but it will be less energy and time efficient than adding weight. An example of high volume guys with big legs are cyclists, especially those who often go uphill.

We can also shift to **training explosiveness**, with sprinting or plyometrics, but this will mostly let us express our already existing strength potential (based on maximal strength), and the volume needed for hypertrophy may cause injuries. It can help though, like for gymnasts who deadlift heavy thanks to tumbling.

**EXAMPLE ROUTINE (1-3 times a week)**:

If some weights are available (all exercises are weighted, rep range can be 3-15 or inbetween):

* 3-5 sets Bulgarian split squats or single leg squats (if hamstrings are tight, stand on an elevated surface, if calves are tight use an elevated heel or counterweight).
* 3-5 sets single leg hip thrusts or single leg deadlifts.
* 3-5 sets hyperextensions or back extensions or reverse shoulder plank (10-30 second hold).
* Optional: 1-5 sets of hamstring isolation exercise (suspended,sliding or Nordic).

If no weights are available (rep range 3-15 or inbetween, when you max out use a harder exercise, if none are available you can do even more reps or sets if time allows):

* 3-5 sets quad dominant progression: if you can't do single leg squats, do partial range until you can. Else elevate the heel or use more ankle mobilty so that your knee travels more forward, or reduce hip hinge. Or do a sissy squat progression (can use wall to limit range of motion). Or kneeling/anchored/plank leg extensions.
* 3-5 sets single leg hip thrust progression (can use [this one](https://www.strongrfastr.com/exercise_progressions/3)).
* 1-5 sets of hamstring isolation ([example progression](https://www.strongrfastr.com/exercise_progressions/2)).
* 3 or more sets of hypers or back extensions to failure or close, some reverse shoulder planks if you want. And if you can do the planche or back lever without much tuck, that can replace or supplement lower back work.

Optional: calf work, plyometrics, sprinting etc.. Explosive or high intensity interval training should count as a leg workout for recovery purposes.

How (and why) to do a Reverse Nordic Curl - one of the most challenging body weight leg exercises out there!,berimbolosforsatan,748,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ricvg0/how_and_why_to_do_a_reverse_nordic_curl_one_of/,1639729527.0,"##tl;dr: https://youtu.be/DmiMI62lmWM 
---
## Why do reverse nordics in the first place?

Today's write-up and video is all about the reverse nordic curl, what it is, why you should be doing it and how to get your first one!

First of all, why should we even consider doing the reverse nordic at all? There's actually a very good reason for for it.

##Quadriceps Anatomy
Your quadriceps are comprised of four muscles, three of them, vastus medialis, intermedius and lateralis act exclusively to extend the knee - his is because the vastus group only cross the knee, a muscle that only crosses one joint is known as monoarticulate.

The fourth quad, rectus femoris, is biarticulate, or it crosses both the hip and the knee and acts to extend the leg as well as being one of the primary muscles involved in flexing the hip. Put simply, when the rec fem contracts, it is going to either flex your hip, or extend your knee. 

 Let's use the squat as an example, although this is true any time both our knee and hip are flexed: at the bottom position, to stand out of the squat, I need to contract my quads to extend my knee whilst simultaneously extending my hip to finish standing. But remember that the rectus femoris wants to actually flex the hip as it straightens the knee, and it creates a lot of hip flexion torque when it does this. 

We have a problem here: if my rectus femoris powerfully contracts from this position, it will straighten my knee, but at the same time it will try to pull my torso further forward into hip flexion, which is not how you stand up out of a squat!  To be able to stand up out of a squat, or a lunge without fighting our own muscles, our central nervous system has to get involved.

Our brain is smart, so what it's going to do is preferentially use the quads aren't going to pull our hip forward as they contract - so the workaround is the CNS preferentially recruits the three vastus quadriceps, because they only extend the knee, and do nothing at the hip. (

So the moral of the story is that squats,  lunges, leg presses and other exercises that require the quads to straighten the knee while the hip is flexed are great for training the the vastus group, but those movements do not create enough mechanical tension in the rectus femoris to induce hypertrophy. Or in other words, if your rec fem to grow, you need to train it directly .

Meatloaf once said 2/3 ain't bad, but in this case, working 3 out of 4 quads is bad - or at the very least you don't want to neglecting one of them Rectus femoris is large and powerful, and for complete leg development it can't be missed!

##So how do we train the rec fem specifically?

Well, in exercises that extend, or straighten the knee whilst the hip stays in extension, the rectus femoris is just as, if not more active than the vastus group. So to train the rectus femoris, we need a movement that extends the knee whilst our hip remains fixed in extension. The perfect exercise to achieve that is the reverse nordic curl. 

##Mobility considerations
But first, a checkpoint. Are you comfortable sitting in deep knee flexion under load? Are you free from any kind of knee pain? If yes, then the reverse nordic curl is for you!

The reverse nordic through its full range of motion is putting the knee through it's full range of knee flexion, so you need to be able to achieve that range of motion in the classic kneeling recfem stretch (shin flat on the wall, and upper back in contact with the wall) before you attempt to put your knee extensors under load at such an acute angle.

##How to perform a reverse nordic, and progressions.
To perform a reverse nordic curl begin kneeling on a padded surface. Squeeze your glutes and abs to brace your core and kneel tall so your body is in a straight line from your femur to the top of your head. From here, keeping your torso in a vertical position and hips extended, slowly lean backwards by bending at the knees. Lower yourself down into the movement gradually as far as you can comfortably control the movement, and return to the starting position by extending the knee.

Given that the further we lower into the movement, the more torque will be going through our knee joints and we will have to create more knee extension torque to raise ourselves back up.  This means the exercise will get harder the lower you go into it, so if you are unable to achieve full range in the reverse nordic curl, to lower the difficulty just reduce the range of motion until your strength increases.

 So that's the simplest way to progress towards the reverse nordic, just gradually increase the range of motion over time. Another benefit of doing it this way is that your flexibility will increase in tandem with your strength level.

Another way of progressing towards a full reverse nordic, is to do an assisted nordic, with either a band or a cable set up to assist you as you go down. The benefit of using a band is that the elastic force of the band increases in the same way as the torque at the knee does - meaning the lower you go into the movement, the higher the strength demands on your quads become, but the band is also helping more and more the deeper you go.  Using a cable machine does not have this accommodating elastic force, it is just a static force assisting you the same way throughout the entire movement. This isn't the worst thing though, because you can choose a resistance level that is sufficient to help you at the bottom, because you will only need that help at the bottom, the rest of the movement is easy, by comparison. Over time once you get stronger at the bottom position, you can decrease the amount of assistance and work twwards your full bodyweight reverse nordic. 

So there you go! That, my friends, is the reverse nordic curl!

I started doing pull-ups with proper form by... stopping counting them,Vitebs47,746,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/brskq6/i_started_doing_pullups_with_proper_form_by/,1558551136.0,"Hello, everyone.

Just wanted to share my experience. Pull-ups have always been my favorite upper-body exercise (or maybe the favorite exercise of all), I always (!) knew how to do them correctly, i.e. retracting your shoulders down and back and trying to squeeze the shoulder blades towards each other, thus moving the body upwards through engaging the lats. Yet, when I kept counting my reps I wanted to do more pull-ups in a given set. What would be the 'best' solution? Rounding my back and tightening the traps, of course, while trying to pull myself up with my arm muscles. I would get a feeling of tension in my neck, uncomfortable sensations of pressure in my skull, not to mention the permanent stagnation in my back development.

Today I tried to focus on the proper technique and, lo and behold, my lats and neck seem to be happy. The former - by receiving the load they deserve, the latter - by not getting too strained when it should not be.

If anyone else doesn't like pull-ups, then it is possible you're not doing it correctly and not getting all the benefits.

Just my experience, of course. Would like to know if some of you had similar issues. Thanks for reading anyway."

Since quarantine started, I started doing bodyweight exercises with the help of r/bodyweightfitness and r/gainit and this is my progress. https://imgur.com/a/tjTrObj (probably NSFW) First picture was 2 years ago, probably 36 kg. Second picture was yesterday 46.3 kg. 
Used to eat probably like 1000 kcal a day back then, maybe less, now eating 2400-2500 kcal.
Stay healthy guys!

"Updated list of the hardest bodyweight leg exercises, with videos where available and illustrations of the theoretical ones. If you have more videos, ideas or your experience please share them.",RockRaiders,747,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8ayzij/updated_list_of_the_hardest_bodyweight_leg/,1523285437.0,"**THIS POST IS OUTDATED, [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jx2zsr/hardest_bodyweight_leg_moves_list_with_video/) IS THE NEW VERSION.**

Here is the list of the leg exercises requiring the most strength, a few of them also require balance and mobility. For the exercises where I could not find a video I've drawn some images to give an idea of what they would look like. If you have seen something harder or can record it yourself, please post a link. Or feel free to share your experience with hard bodyweight exercises even if they are easier than the ones here or ideas for new leg elements.

If you have a squat rack available you don't need most of these, and with limited weight, even improvised (sandbags are cheap, [construction guide by Ross Enamait](http://www.rosstraining.com/sandbagconstructionkit.pdf)) you can do weighted single leg exercises (pistol squat, skater squat, split squat, deep step up, hip thrust, Romanian deadlift etc.), and Nordic curls are still useful in any routine, even if you have barbells.

The following exercises are hard even with no added weight but of course you can do them weighted if you want.

**Update**: Any exercises unlocked after this post was submitted are marked as ""new"". Stefano Ravarino was inspired by this article and has made a video demonstrating many leg exercises, from beginner to the hardest unlocked so far and also has good illustrations of the unreached versions too. [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIpsvNAT834). 

**THINGS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT.**

* Proper knee tracking, especially in single leg variations. The knee should face the direction of the middle toes, if it collapses inside ([knee valgus](https://bretcontreras.com/knee-valgus-valgus-collapse-glute-medius-strengthening-band-hip-abduction-exercises-and-ankle-dorsiflexion-drills/), [another article](https://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2012/12/28/what-causes-knee-valgus/)) there is a lot of stress on the medial collateral ligament. Not to be confused with how far forward the knee travels over the toes, which is [not a problem](https://squatuniversity.com/2016/01/29/can-the-knees-go-over-the-toes-debunking-squat-myths/). Improving strength in the outer glute (gluteus medius), strengthening the foot's arch and increasing ankle mobility (to avoid compensations with pronation where the weight is too much on the inside of the foot, causing the loss of the arch and valgus) make the knee more stable, and support from the free leg (like in Bulgarian split squats and [maximally deep step ups](https://instagram.com/p/1jdRZorwdE)) or the hands can be used to reduce the stability requirement.
* Knee shearing forces. For the straight body quad exercises they are higher, but if you have healthy knees and anterior cruciate ligaments and limit volume and intensity until you adapt and can do more without discomfort, it's fine. [Article](http://nicktumminello.com/2011/05/are-leg-extensions-good-or-bad-safe-or-dangerous-effective-or-a-waste-of-time-functional-or-nonfunctional-exercise-expert-brad-schoenfeld-has-the-surprising-answers/) by Brad Schoenfeld, [related advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/87e8vm/new_amazing_leg_exercise_by_matteo_spinazzola/dwe2i0k/) by Joshua Naterman. It's similar to shearing stress on the elbows in muscle ups, people build up progressively to levels like a [+45kg/100lbs ring muscle up](https://youtu.be/akwztrxpjao?t=3m13s) at 65kg/143lbs bodyweight. That's +70% BW!
* Enough padding for the knees and the feet where they are anchored in Nordic curls, so that the kneecaps can move freely, and for the calves in strap leg extensions, and using stable and robust places to anchor yourself, you need an anchor point that can support hundreds of pounds/kilograms.

**NATURAL ONE LEG PRESS.**

Challenges quads and glutes through a full range of motion. This looks deceptively easy but depending on the friction of the surface you use, it can be as hard as a pistol squat with 40% bodyweight on a wooden door with a towel, or 75% bodyweight in the video, even more if there is more friction. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5p1FVxOHX8), [post with discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/87e8vm/new_amazing_leg_exercise_by_matteo_spinazzola/), [Naterman's safety advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/87e8vm/new_amazing_leg_exercise_by_matteo_spinazzola/dwcxrjq/). I have tried doing it at the park against a metal pole and it can work too, it's just harder to balance with less surface. There were already videos of this exercise on two legs with a skateboard or single leg with a stability ball, but those are regressions and the concept of doing this while maximizing friction is new so there is still a lot of research to be done about this exercise.

**New:** [deficit natural one leg press](https://youtu.be/_VEewYqn_SQ?t=3m49s), even more strength required and even more dangerous if you try this despite knee problems. The hardest leg exercise currently unlocked, at least when done on that surface with high friction.

**FREESTANDING QUAD ISOLATION.**

**Advanced shrimp squat.**

Intentionally done on the toes, the center mass will be over them and the more the knee travels forward, the longer the lever arm on the knee. The hardest version is the [Ido Portal shrimp](https://www.facebook.com/portal.ido/posts/548255915216393). Both arms behind, hip of the free leg as straight as possible, a deficit for full knee flexion. The glute does some work too but not a lot since the lever arm on it is short. More balance than pistols is required but a lot less than free handstand pushups, which are used by people for working sets for strength and size, as shown by [Jonathan Ferland-Valois/wandererstraining](https://www.instagram.com/p/9JxZgwRbrn/?taken-by=jfvtraining) and [LittleBeastM/Metin Dabak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovk9mm-Y-i4).

* [Exact demonstration of Ido's version](https://youtu.be/52qFFMdlPFA?t=22s). The only difference is that Ido supposedly starts from the bottom to eliminate the stretch reflex.
* [More demonstrations of Ido's form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aExVWmYiBl4), the guy who did them says he found [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch6M-hXgL-c) more difficult because of having to reset the tension when the knee rests on a surface at the bottom.
* [9 reps with the help of the stretch reflex and having the wall by the side instead of behind, so slightly easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtkyb6S0YTU).
* All three of these guys can squat around 2x bodyweight. I can do a pistol squat with +50% BW but can only do a slow negative of the two hand floor shrimp with no deficit, which is easier, so the advanced shrimp is quite challenging and this explains why there are so few deficit two hand shrimp videos on youtube.
* **New**: [5 elevated repetitions with the wall in front and not by the side](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqdDDx1iif2/). Best performance I've seen for now.
* **New**: [very quad dominant one leg squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuO9WNSHqRQ/) (after the elevated two hand shrimps). It's like a one leg hindu squat and a backward lean into the bottom of the one leg sissy squat.

**Single leg sissy squats and kneeling leg extensions.**

These, done single leg and with a straight body, with arms overhead if possible (unless it shifts the weight too much behind the center mass, causing you to fall back), would be much harder than the Ido shrimp. I have not seen videos of the real deal so [here](https://i.imgur.com/1AsSwNo.jpg) are some illustrations of how they could look like. Update: kneeling single leg extension now exists! Some variations:

* [Super deep two leg sissy](https://youtu.be/uvm1GThWnPA?t=2m41s).
* **New**: (actually a very old video) [absurd sissy squat](https://youtu.be/61cY1ILv60k?t=167), with a lot of hip internal rotation too, I've never seen anything like this, it also requires a lot of spine mobility, I don't know if others have done this.
* [Super deep kneeling leg extension](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf_pIRLjhoP/?taken-by=matteodeu), arms overhead for the longest lever arm. An assisted single leg version similar to the sissy or a real single leg one with the free leg off the ground like a pistol squat could be possible. 
* **New**: [kneeling one leg extension with slight balance assist](https://youtu.be/6JpV0NPQ9s4?t=35s).
* [Assisted one leg sissy](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDTZo7xC5Bu/). Not easier to balance than unassisted, but requires a lot less strength.
* **New**: [one leg sissy with some wall assist, partial range](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=8m10s).
* **New**: [door frame assisted concentric and fully elevated negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJcMvOIQfIU), trying to assist with the upper body as little as possible. Can also be done with dip bars or similar parallel supports, [here](https://youtu.be/nijCCcCTFVk?t=95) is a heavily weighted (60kg/132lbs) elevated concentric with some hip bend, it's possible that by squeezing the support hard the arms can assist noticeably.
* **New**: [unassisted one leg sissy partial concentric and full negative](https://youtu.be/p2BjeaMX4kg?t=2m2s). Note: Naterman told me this is a very dangerous movement and he would not recommend this to anyone. So I guess the wall assisted version above is much better, if you try it freestanding it's at your own risk.
* **New**: [unassisted full negative and bent hips concentric](https://youtu.be/exVH5THNBHk?t=685), and [another guy who is equally close to a clean repetition](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpmRhNIn3FC/). Two different ways of positioning the free leg.
* **New**: [Kneeling one leg extension](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj7OrQpDHtQ/). Hardest quad element currently unlocked, harder than the natural one leg press according to Matteo Spinazzola. Although the elevated one leg press on a rough surface is harder than this, but it's a compound movement.
* **New**: one leg sissy squat from horizontal shin position, [3 reps from mat](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv17oCan4Gh/), [one rep with no support at the bottom](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxmnk61h99-/). Maybe harder than the one leg extension, and still not a full range one leg sissy squat. I'm not sure the second video is not a reversed recording of an eccentric.

**NEW: friction resisted sissy squats.**

From [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8j20c6/bwf_daily_discussion_and_beginnerrr_questions/dyxalav/) by u/Jack_n_coke. [Video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkDenuQftw) and [thread with form cues and other advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9iwyqz/friction_resisted_sissy_squats_require/) 

Very practical since you can reasonably get maximum knee flexion without balance or mobility being a problem. With smooth wood it may be easier than freestanding sissy squats, but on less smooth surfaces it can be harder. 

And the one leg version seems to be doable, the wall helps with knee stability. 

**STRAIGHT BODY HAMSTRING CURLS.**

If we have the [hefesto](https://youtu.be/IfZDaVfXsKU?t=18s) for the biceps, these are the counterpart for the ""lower body biceps"".

A relatively easy variation worth mentioning: [suspended single leg hamstring body curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4-9l57Y-28).

**With inversion boots.**

* [Inversion/gravity boot squats](https://youtu.be/_nqnIlZfm-Q?t=10s), these are a hamstring curl actually and the two leg version is not super hard, but imagine doing it with a straight body (by fully extending the hips), it would be like an upside down version of the Nordic curl. Or single leg, and the theoretically hardest version would be single leg, straight body, arms overhead. I have illustrated the theoretical harder variations [here](https://i.imgur.com/pbqHqnf.jpg).
* **New**: [leg human flag curl](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=6m50s), not very practical but challenging and creative.
* **New**: [one leg inverted pistol squats](https://youtu.be/Mhhk4b0X_F4?t=28) to 90° knee. Compared to the link below, the range is slightly less, but no support from a hand holding a pole, and maybe less ergonomical because of the improvised alternative to inversion boots.
* **New**: [one leg inversion boot squats](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=9m43s), with a hand holding the pole for stability, not full range but close.
* **New**: inverted Nordic curl, on stall bars with inversion boots (the link above, a few seconds later), partial range of motion.
* **New**: inverted Nordic curls to 90° knee, [with door anchor](https://youtu.be/sGq9puaoqX8?t=27) and [stall bars](https://youtu.be/ePkQ1MzD7uQ?t=21), the latter setup is safer and does not require a partner attaching the carabinier.
* The straight body inverted one leg Nordic curl with a full range of motion (hamstring touching the calf) could be the hardest hamstring exercise ever.

**Nordic curls.**

The normal two legs ones are already quite hard, but these are even harder:

* [Arms overhead](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYof3zMjrF3/?taken-by=matteodeu) for a longer lever arm.
* [On decline bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHInsiQlzgc) to get a longer arc under load. You can add more and more decline until you do inverted Nordic curls.
* [Crossed legs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbCAT6fjQ5b/?taken-by=matteodeu), Matteo Spinazzola says one rep feels like a normal Nordic curl with +25-30% BW.
* **New**: [one leg Nordic curl](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhQRxGnhSZg/?taken-by=athletic_truth_group) with some hip bend during the ascent, [another guy](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuGyp-rB1p2/).
* **New**: [One leg and the other knee not supported](https://youtu.be/jq3YrZsWae0?t=34). Quite good form!
* **New**: [13 repetitions](https://youtu.be/nijCCcCTFVk?t=111) with reasonably good form, still not perfect but the greatest display of bodyweight hamstring strength I've seen for now.
* A single leg decline version with a straight body and arms overhead would be the hardest version, [here](https://i.imgur.com/t7Sx7vb.jpg) is an illustration.

**STRAIGHT BODY ANCHORED QUAD EXTENSIONS.**

We have [impossible dips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCzD-_-b2Y8) and [impossible tiger bends](https://youtu.be/xCzD-_-b2Y8?t=3m40s) for the triceps, and the quads are like the lower body triceps.

**Vertical shin leg extensions.**

Often done on an apparatus called sissy squat machine/bench/Roman chair squat, or quad blaster. A fitting name would be Matrix squats or Neo squats since they resemble Neo's movement in the famous [bullet dodge scene](https://youtu.be/KNrSNcaYiZg?t=2m4s). Can be done against a pole with the feet pressing into it to avoid sliding.

* [Variation in sand](https://youtu.be/QiF5eGR6C_E?t=6s), worth mentioning since without this video I would not have learned about this exercise. Even unweighted it's harder than pistol squats.
* [Arms overhead descending to parallel](https://youtu.be/Z1rk2j0WK48?t=1m52s), this is the hardest possible leverage on two legs but more range of motion would make it harder.
* [Progression steps ending with the arms overhead to parallel version](https://youtu.be/obJ22vlpU3Q?t=16s). Also showing one of the simplest setups for this exercise.
* [Extra range of motion on the sissy squat bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otsrtdyw2fQ). Significantly more knee flexion but slight hip bend.
* **New**: [the highest range of motion achievable on the floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIBfpwvq5SA). Had to link myself again since I could not find anything similar on youtube, it feels as hard as a pistol squat with +40% bodyweight.
* **New**: [Maximum range of motion on two legs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY7GhsnLRmg), the calf touches the hamstring at the bottom, extending the arms overhead would make it even harder.
* [Proof of concept for an assisted single leg version](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYud8bJAQlA/?taken-by=ramses_calistenico). Only one leg is fixed, the other could be kept as straight as possible and slide during the movement to only provide stability against knee valgus without contributing much in strength. [This image](https://imgur.com/fM51is8) explains the problem with true single leg matrix squats. You'd need to lean/bend the torso to the side to balance yourself. Update: you can avoid this problem without twisting to the side but you still need some lean and a lot of caution to avoid knee damage.
* Illustrations of the missing variations: super deep two legs, assisted single leg, real single leg [here](https://i.imgur.com/m9tJJoQ.jpg).
* **New**: [shrimp quad blaster](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=7m37s). Basically a tucked Matrix squat with the knee touching the floor at the bottom. A big difficulty is resetting the body tension to lift off after the knee is on the floor. Not necessarily a safe/practical variation compared to normal Matrix squats, but creative and hard.
* **New**: [true one leg to parallel](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=8m48s). Much better form than I expected to be possible, requires very good bracing with the strap and toes bent and solidly in contact with a wall.
* **New**: [one leg to parallel with arms overhead](https://youtu.be/F-2nbK9EiC8?t=26). This pipe setup provides good support making it not so awkward to balance, further knee flexion is not possible but this is a notable level.
* **New**: [one leg to parallel, 3 reps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF2XyZ87334&t=0s). Another stable setup, with a bench. Some hip bend but a good achievement.

**Horizontal shin leg extensions.** (a possible name is leg extension lever)

* [Full range of motion](https://youtu.be/1egn6D4T82E?t=18s), the top part can also be done on a [park bench](https://i.imgur.com/a4Hzo9E.jpg), or by fixing the legs to some bench with a strap. Could be made harder with a pause at the top, arms overhead, assisted single leg (only one leg held down or fixed with a strap), true single leg. 
* For the park bench and strap true single leg version, [here](https://i.imgur.com/4qm8a9c.jpg) is an illustration.
* **New**: [using monkey bars as an anchor point](https://youtu.be/K1Gw9uWUX4s?t=10).
* **New**: [good form with a bench and a doorframe telescopic pullup bar](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=6m26s). Arms overhead extends the lever. The version shown by the gymnast is harder if a pause at the top is made, since the body is always kept straight, but it needs a high surface to give the body space.
* **New**: [one leg version, slightly bent body](https://youtu.be/AIpsvNAT834?t=9m18s). According to the person executing it knee twisting is not a problem, in contrast to the one leg Matrix squat. Straight spine and arms overhead would be harder.

**OTHER INTERESTING STUFF.**

* For the straight body quad and hamstring variations, you can change the incline to modify the challenging arc, [here](https://i.imgur.com/uyf1eXA.jpg) is an illustration of the concept.
* [Cool mobility stuff by Jon Yuen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvm1GThWnPA). Not really more challenging for the quads and glutes compared to pistols and sissy squats, but active mobility at end range is also a form of strength.

**CONCLUSION.**

The ultimate theoretical exercises requiring zero weights are these:

* For quad isolation, the real single leg version of the sissy squat, kneeling leg extension, vertical shin (Matrix squat) or horizontal shin leg extension (leg extension lever) with no support from the free leg, straight body, arms overhead for the longest lever arm and using the maximum ROM possible. An assisted single leg version with the free leg providing balance is probably much more practical and safe, but the one leg extension lever has been shown to be practical since there are no knee twisting problems, only the need for well conditioned knee tendons.
* For hamstring isolation, real single leg decline or inverted Nordic curl. Straight body, arms overhead, maximum knee flexion at the top. 
* For compound glutes and quads, the deficit natural one leg press with a very high friction surface. [Shoulders and feet elevated single leg hip thrusts](https://youtu.be/YIpw8ogCVKs?t=3m20s) are the hardest glute isolation I know of, but it's not very challenging since the glutes are often the biggest and strongest muscle of the body. Maybe also glute bridges against an immovable resistance.
* For calves: for the [gastrocnemius](http://www.exrx.net/Muscles/Gastrocnemius.html) Nordic curls with plantarflexed ankles (straight) since the gastroc is also a knee flexor, or deep single leg calf raises without bouncing (no stretch reflex), maybe [straight leg calf jumps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di3aYgaLGu8) on one foot, for the [soleus](http://www.exrx.net/Muscles/Soleus.html) single leg calf raises or jumps at the bottom of a squat. But you can just do sports, rope skipping etc. and the calves will grow.
* For the shins (tibialis): shin raises [with a wall](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwuZqsmntel/), done with the feet far from it and on one leg.
* Adductors and abductors: unsupported side splits and the stuff from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm4etEeE9Cg). For adductors [sliding from splits to standing](https://youtu.be/Ly1SSSyns-s?t=186).
* Spinal erectors: reverse hyperextensions, (the back lever or [back lever leg lifts](https://youtu.be/jKXicOT7aYg?t=46s) are not actually more challenging for the lower back, only for the upper body), but for endless resistance isometric deadlifts or good mornings against something immovable like a rope or towel or bedsheet etc.

An interesting addition to a true minimalist routine could be [ring deadlift isometrics](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/85v00e/how_to_do_maximally_heavy_deadlift_and_squat/), with wrist straps to eliminate grip limitations, with these you could also potentially challenge the spinal erectors long term. Or just a strap for [squats](https://i.imgur.com/Z0l0wXk.jpg) and [deadlifts](https://www.allthingsstrength.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/deadlift-e1424348951752.png) and good mornings etc.

Relevant stuff: [Ross Enamait's isometric tool](http://rosstraining.com/blog/2009/02/23/homemade-isometric-tool/) and [training with resistance bands](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2e0qqw/can_resistance_bands_be_used_to_gain_muscle_mass/), which is similar because the tension is maximized in a narrow range of motion. 

Explosive training, like jumping single leg squats, broad and high jumps, sprinting etc. are also useful to periodize/integrate in a leg routine, thanks u/ImmodestPolitician for the suggestion.

I think minimalist leg training has undiscovered potential. Update: [ideas for combining these different approaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8h0n6h/minimalist_leg_strength_training_long_term_sets/).

It includes bars for pull ups, dips, handstands, and human flags. I was also able to attach my rings to it. Built the structure entirely with wood and pipe from home depot. It wiggles a bit during muscle ups but for the most part it's sturdy

Edit:
I AM NOT AN ENGINEER I AM A TEENAGER SO I CANNOT 100% VOUCH FOR THE RIGIDITY OF THIS STRUCTURE IF ANYBODY TRIES TO BUILD SOMETHING SIMILAR
although I did have my grandfather who is an engineer go over the plans ahead of time and he said it was ""probably ok""

Anyways, I don't have any blueprints or 3d images like some of you were requesting so I just made a youtube video that should give you a good rundown of the dimensions of the structure. Here's the link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46u_woiQR6g
I misspoke in the video, the vertical pole is 1 1/2, not 2""

Here are some links to most but not all of the materials that I needed. I bought most of my stuff in store so this may not be exactly what I got. Make sure to check the measurements on everything before buying

All in all I'd say this project cost me somewhere around $400 or $500 but I already had access to drills, a sawzaw, and a large table saw

A couple sidenotes:
yes the dip bars are very low. I messed up but luckily they still work as long as I bend my knees. I definitely won't be able to do weighted dips though
Also the structure isn't secured to the concrete platform in any way, it's just sitting on top

6 years of poor handstand habits fixed over the past 3 months - Progress report,HandstandAddict,747,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/99kf26/6_years_of_poor_handstand_habits_fixed_over_the/,1534999403.0,"A few months ago, I took a handstand workshop from a Cirque du Soleil handbalancer who happened to be doing a show in my city. Before I walked into the class, I was 100% confident in my handstand and thought I was ready to start training one arm handstands. I couldn't be more wrong.  

I had always thought that a handstand was considered straight as long there was no arch in the lower back. But I've come to learn that a truly straight handstand is when everything from your arms, upper back, hips, legs, to ankles are dead on parallel with one another.  Let me show you what I mean.

Here are my progression pics from June, July, and August. https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmp_HjiFrW7/?taken-by=tokyo_acroyoga

In the first picture, taken just a few days after the workshop, you can clearly see my upper torso leaning at an angle, with my shoulders in front of my chest (ie. planching). Even though it felt like I was totally straight, the camera doesn't lie. Since I was training in that position for years, the muscles in the front of my body (front delts, serratus anterior) got super strong but the muscles in the upper back (trapezius, rhomboids) were completely neglected since I wasn't in the proper position to use them.  This appears to be the case for the vast majority of people and is rarely talked about.  

If you are planching your shoulders too (and you probably are), it's because of lack of shoulder mobility. Even if you have very flexible shoulders, you probably still lack mobility not because of tightness, but because you're weak in that specific range of motion.   

To fix that, I started doing overhead lat stretches 2x a day to increase how far I could raise my arms. After each stretch session, I would walk over to my good reliable friend, the wall, and do chest-to-wall holds for time, trying to touch my nose to the wall while at the same time, sticking my butt as far away from the wall as possible, tucking my ribs in, and shrugging my shoulders as much as possible. This shit is HARD.  Keeping track of 4 points simultaneously while your muscles are screaming is no easy feat.  Doing this though, allowed me to quickly strengthen my back muscles properly.

After this ""warmup"", I would do freestanding and wall tuck holds, actively trying to shove my upper torso through my arms, until I could feel it in my upper back.  I continued doing this twice a week for a month.  

By July (second pic), my shoulders were coming close to where I wanted them to be but it was still taking a lot of effort to hold it there.  My hips also too piked due to tight hip flexors.  These two things caused me to fall towards my feet more often than not. This stage was the most frustrating since my previously stable 1 minute holds had now dropped to sporadic 10 second holds as I fought to keep the line.  It felt like I was a noob again.  

In the third pic, which was taken just a week ago, you can see my line had improved significantly. Shoulders over palms, upper and lower back are completely straight. Hips neutral. Ribs tucked in. It's still not perfect since my hips are actually twisted to my right, which is why you can see both of my legs yet not both of my arms. I'm currently working to fix this because it causes me to rotate out whenever I work on one arm progressions. Last minor point is my feet could be straighter, but I can't do much about it now as I have to work ankle flexibility first.

Overall, I'm much happier with my line and feel more confident in moving ahead to one arm progressions again. Hope this helps people recognize faults in their own handstands. Stay tuned for more updates in the future!

TLDR; Your handstand line is probably shit.  Fix it.  "
Ab exercises that are pretty beginner that don’t kill my hip flexors?,Allen_Warren,736,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kq7ott/ab_exercises_that_are_pretty_beginner_that_dont/,1609762867.0,"I’m getting back into the world of fitness and decided to go the calisthenics route! Having a lot of fun so far, but I’m really bad about training my abs. This is probably the weakest part of my body and what I need to train the most to even out my strength. The problem is that I always end up working the front of my hips more than my abs. I did bicycle kicks and mountain climbers the other day, and now my abs feel fine but my hip flexors are killing me. This is not good, right (lol)? I know sit ups are pretty much a no go and I should be doing more planks, but I’m pretty lost outside of that."
Progress: I can do 100 Navy Seals & 100 Kickout Burpees now,naechsteanmeldung,740,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ma5gx7/progress_i_can_do_100_navy_seals_100_kickout/,1616358818.0,"It's still Lockdown here in Germany, it's still cold, and I'm still doing my High Rep Burpees. This means I've been doing them for a half year now. I think I made some great fitness improvements compared to weight lifting in the gym.

&nbsp;
       
**Progress**

In January I managed to do 100 navy seal burpees with a pace of 15s per burpee - a total time of about 25 minutes. I've posted this video as progress post back than - so you can check, that this pushed me to my limits back than.

Today I can do 100 Navy Seals and 100 kickout burpees - and the workload is ok. 

&nbsp;

How did I train for this?

&nbsp;

I often did burpees as interval training, so a small number of burpees at a pace that I could only keep up for a few minutes. For example: 20x Navy Seal burpees with 9s pace per burpee, one minute rest and the whole thing repeated 5 times. I'm pretty sure, that this contribute to my cardio vascular gains.

&nbsp;

I have been inspired by running workout plans. So I've often done burpees as interval training, meaning a small number of burpees at a pace I can only keep up for a few minutes. For example: 20x Navy Seal burpees with 9s pace per burpee, one minute rest and the whole thing repeated 5 times. 

Or casual workouts with a slow pace.

And training sessions with a very high number of repetitions (>100) limited to max. once a week, because they always require a few days of recovery (I am 31 after all).

&nbsp;


**The workout**

- Alternating between Navy Seal Burpees and Kickout Burpees
- Pace: 16s/burpee

Here you can see my workout: 
[100 navy seals & 100 Kickout burpees with constant pace](https://youtu.be/lGMUABBLYMo)


&nbsp;

**Some other learnings**:

&nbsp;

 - Before that, my primary focus was the good old Navy Seal burpee - cardiovascularly demanding and with a special focus on the abdominal muscles. I still do Navy Seals burpees, but I like to alternate them with the kickout burpee:
The forward jumping motion still requires additional power from the legs and to some degree it mirrors with the fitness exercise cable  over pulls  - hence we also have an increased load for the lat.

&nbsp;



 - In my other two videos I filmed from the side facing away from the sun. Ergo no shadows, making muscle appear less deep and smaller. This time I filmed from the sunny side, resulting in optical shoulder-gains. For those who like to take photos and want to emphasize muscles: a low sun is recommended to enhance the effect. The video here was made before lunch.



&nbsp;



**Warning**:

&nbsp;

Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2t18hi/to_everyone_doing_a_pushupsquatplankwhatever/) about high repetition plank/push-up/squad challenges from the FAQ:

>  If you're looking to get into exercising, you typically have some kind of goals like ""look better naked"" or ""get stronger"". While these challenges might influence your body composition a little, there are much better ways to go about changing that. 

> There is a certain injury risk associated with this kind of challenge.

The advantage over plank/push-up/squad challenges: You have a more hollistic workout if you do burpees. Make sure that you have variances in your workouts."
How to do an L-Sit on the Floor and on your Fingers - a Comprehensive Guide,Ares_the_God_of_War,737,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/d7v72i/how_to_do_an_lsit_on_the_floor_and_on_your/,1569180389.0,"On today's Sunday Showoff thread I posted this image of me doing an L-Sit on my fingers: https://imgur.com/a/uisyVe3

People wanted a tutorial on how to do the L-Sit on your fingers or on the floor in general so here we go.
(If you just want to learn how to do it on your fingers, skip to 7.)

[0.: Forget about progressions]

No, don't actually forget about them. The thing is, that a lot of beginners can be intimidated by the way that progressions are often presented. ""You need to be able to hold a tuck L-sit for more than 30s before moving on"". I personally never used L-Sit progressions like the tuck L-sit and I was most likely not able to hold it for more than 30s when I was able to hold a 10s floor L-sit

[1.: Scheduling]

Generally, the L-Sit isn't a high intensity movement. You will be fine if you train it often. When I was beginning to train for it, I worked on it around 4 days a week, but I did attempts pretty much daily. You should work on L-Sit attempts after your warmup and BEFORE your strength work, but do the isolation movements (that I will talk about soon) AFTER your strength work.

[2.: Flexibility]

Perhaps the most frustrating thing that will happen in the beginning is that you just can't get your legs straight. That's why it's super important to stretch your hamstrings often. I used to stretch them at least 5 times per week. The best active stretch I found was this one: https://youtu.be/ki8ZaeXmkaM
-Do this twice per day, at least 4 times per week.
Once you can reach your toes or even further, you're good to go.

[3.: Lower Body Compression]

This is where it gets interesting. It won't help much if you can put your palms on the floor as long as you don't have the needed strength to keep your legs up. You need good COMPRESSION. That's the ability to bring your lower body to your upper body. Compression strength is the number one component that beginners tend to skip and that's a horrible mistake because it will make your life much easier.
Here are my favourite exercises for compression strength:

-Seated Leg Lifts/ Pike Compressions(the best exercise): https://youtu.be/5NU3HsSvP3Y 
Do 3 sets of 8-15reps

-Hanging L-sit raises https://youtu.be/AHx5p-jDg7o
Do 3 sets of 6-12reps

-Skin the Cat https://youtu.be/avlj56L_E-A (you might need to do this with bent legs)
Do 3 sets of 2-8reps

-Hollow Body Hold https://youtu.be/4xRpGgttca8 (this one's more for general core strength but also very important)
Do 3 sets of 15-60s

Incorporate these exercises into your training. Either do 1 to 2 of these exercises after your regular training or do all of them as a core workout. The most important thing: Do them!

[4.: Upper body Depression]

This is very important when you want to do an L-sit on the floor. Chances are that you've already done an L-sit on parallettes but have failed to do it on the ground because you just can't get your butt off the floor. This will help. 
Scapular Depression is when you push your shoulders down. Think of trying to push the ground away and making a long neck. Doing an L-Sit on the ground requires better depression because your butt can't drop below the line of your hands. That's why you can cheat on parallettes. Generally I don't recommend using parallettes before you can do the L-sit on the ground.

Here are my favourite exercises to get a stronger scapular depression:

-Dips with full lockout at the top (arms straight, shoulder blades down, push the bars away from you)
You're probably already doing these

-Scapula Dips https://youtu.be/Ucj5HZFfXes
Do 3 sets of 8-15 reps

-L sit lifts (Didn't find a video of this. Basically you're sitting down in the L-sit position on the ground, then you will push into the ground and try to lift into the L-Sit. Don't hold, just come back down and repeat for legs. If it's too hard, keep your legs on the floor. You can increase the range of motion by using parallettes.)
Do 3 sets of 3-10 reps

Same as the lower body exercises, find a way to incorporate these into your training. It will help.

[5.:Balance]

Balance can play a role when L-sitting, but the balance demands are pretty minor. My only advice here: practice. It gets easy fairly quickly.

[6.: Workout]

If you're really serious about getting the L-Sit, this is a workout routine that you can follow to achieve it quickly: 

(Exercises with the same letter are supersets)

-Active Warmup, dynamic stretching of hamstrings
-L-sit attempts (try to get a feel for it)
-Dips with lockout 2-3x5-12r
-Scapular Dips 2-3x8-15r
-L-sit lifts 1-3x3-10r

-A1 Pike Compressions 8-15r

-A2 Hanging Leg Lifts 6-12r

-A3 Skin the Cat 2-8r

->2-3 rounds

-Hollow Body hold 1-3x15-60s

These are a lot of exercises. If you want, you can of course do less sets or take some exercises out completely. But since they aren't very high intensity movements, it won't be harmful to do them at a high volume. This workout is intended for people who's main goal is the L-sit 

[7.: Fingers]

Okay, so this is where the pain begins. It's needless to say that a regular L-sit is a prerequisite for the Finger L-sit. When you first attempt an L-sit on your fingers, you might not be able to lift up. That's normal. We first need to strengthen our fingers to hold the load. Here's how.

[7.1.: Finger Strength]

First things first. Don't do too much of this. Seriously, if you overwork your fingers you're going to get f'ed up bad. When I was conditioning my fingers for the finger L-sit, I wasn't working on them more than twice per week. Preferrably just once a week. Tendons and Ligaments need a lot of time to recover, you need to respect that. It will still give you good progress, don't worry. By the way, these exercises will also help you with other skills on your fingers, like planches or crow pose etc. .
As to how to actually train them, there's three things that have helped me.

1. Gripping/Hanging
Probably the most straightforward exercise. Grip onto a bar and hang. To target your fingers more, put your thumbs and palms away and hang only on your fingers.
-Do 2-4 sets of near max hanging

2. Rice Bucket
This is awesome to generally increase the strength and stability in your hands. Tykato Fitness has a great rice bucket routine: https://youtu.be/S8alVQTo4Z0

3. Fingertip Pushups
This is the most important part of the finger training. It's important to take your time with this and progress slowly. These are the progressions that I used:

(All of these are done on your fingers, of course)

-Knee Pushups (legs piked 90°),

-Knee Pushup (legs piked 45°),

-Knee Pushups (no piking),

-Plank,

-L-Sit on Fingers (Yeah!!!),

-Fingertip Pushups 

Aim for AT LEAST 12 reps before moving onto the next progression. You need to be really comfortable in your current progression and not feel any pain.
You can also see that the L-sit is not the highest progression on my list. That's because I was able to do it without doing Full Finger Pushups. The latter are for further strengthening your fingers for more advanced movements or to hold longer.

[7.2.: Workout]

You can do all of these 3 methods in one workout (be careful) or spread them out over the week. It's up to you.

-Hanging 3xNear Max Hold

-Tykato's rice bucket routine

-Fingertip Pushup progression 2-4x6-15r

This might take a long time. It took me some months to be able to hold it on my fingers for some seconds and it takes time to work up to holding it longer. You'll just have to stay consistent. Also, listen to your body. If your fingers are aching constantly, stop it. Take at least a week off and assess it afterwards.

[7.3.: Finger Balance and Hand Placement]

It's harder to keep a straight line on your fingers. The hand placement plays a large role in this aswell as in the overall endurance. I personally prefer to keep my thumbs in front, others like to point their thumbs backwards. Personal preference. I generally have thin fingers. That might be the reason why I prefer to have more load on my thumbs than on my fingers. Try it out and see what works for you.

How do you motivate yourself to workout?,ielashi,739,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/c1dale/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_workout/,1560710490.0,"I'm wondering how people on this subreddit motivate themselves to stick to working out. Personally, I found it difficult to stick to a routine indefinitely, and the approach that worked much better for me was to adopt the concept of a ""workout project"". A workout project has a beginning and an end, and is usually tied with specific goals (either achieving a particular feat or finishing a scheduled workout program). I've done a few workout projects at this point, often back-to-back, and found it to be a much better motivator for me seeing the end in sight.

finally after 1.5 years of consistent training i did my first muscle up!,serotonin95,738,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qcsl07/finally_after_15_years_of_consistent_training_i/,1634825138.0,"I have been fascinated by muscle ups for a couple of years now. For alot of time i struggled with the technique and transition which was very frustrating. The gamechanger for me was the grip. By switching to a false grip on the bar and by swinging corrently around the bar and not directly up like with a pull up like i did before i was finally able to do one! its crazy how much is actually just technique.   When I started to used to the pull i managed to do 4 in a row with very little kipping

If you want to learn the muscle up and can do several pull ups with good form look i garantee you can do it with proper technique!

I've always been active, a gym rat, but recently I decided I was tired of not being able to do some of these cool bodyweight activities that a lot of people can do.

So on January 8th, I decided to start. I started with a headstand, that came easy. Shortly after that I started working on a handstand. WOW was it hard! I really thought I'd never learn how to do it, but I obsessed over it anyway. I scoured every piece of info I could find and read/watched it over and over.

My wrists started hurting really bad, and I asked you guys about it. I was told to take a week off, and I did. THANK you, seriously! I came back able to do a handstand better than I ever could, with zero pain at all. That week off really helped, a lot. I was over doing it.

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks and say that you really can learn whatever you want if you put your mind to it. I was really skeptical about being able to handstand, but here I am doing nearly 30 second stands in less than a month. I'm stoked!
My form is still bad, but I'm working on it.

 Here's to a 2017 filled with lots of bodyweight movements, planches, front levers, the works. I will be doing these things soon! My main motivation is my daughter, who will be born in March. Like her mommy, she will most likely do gymnastics when she's of age. Hopefully I can be right there beside her the whole way.

Here's a short vid of the stand I got last night, thanks to r/bodyweight!

"So you're considering doing 30 days of 100 pull-ups, I see.",ConfusionInTheRanks,732,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g5uhdf/so_youre_considering_doing_30_days_of_100_pullups/,1587529043.0,"Step 1: Don't.

Step 2: Don't.

Step 3: 42



But, seriously, if you're going to do it, try, here's some things that might be helpful.

1. Do not jump right into it. Make sure you can do a 100 in one day. The next day you'll be too sore to do any more. This is normal. You'll have to build up to doing it, even if it means practising twice a week for a week or two beforehand. You don't even have to get up to 100 in this period, you're just practising.

2. Try different types of pull-ups. That includes wide grip, close grip,  and even parallel pull ups. You'll be able to get better at all of them.

3. You're likely to get some calluses on your hands and knuckles. You should try to prepare for that if that might concern you.

4. It's okay to do it at your own pace. When I started, I could get them done in about an hour, towards the end, it was a lot quicker.

5. It may not feel good, or even normal at first. Once as you start doing it, you'll get into a nice groove with it, but it will take some time.

6. When lowering yourself to the ground, do not suddenly drop down. Your elbows will take a lot of extra strain that they're not used to. Lower yourself down, but don't get to the top of the rep and just drop down. You're not made for that.

7. Break them up into sets. Maybe you'll do 10 sets of 10. Maybe 5 sets of 20. Or 20 sets of 5. You don't have to work yourself until you can't breathe for exercise to count. 

8. Keeping at it, even through out the day, and completing it in one day is important. You don't want to go 'Well, I missed today's, so I'll do 200 tomorrow'. While that is a fun challenge... hey, you're already doing 100 a day. That's already a challenge.

9. Drink water when you're thirsty.

10. There will be days where you don't want to do it. That is normal. You'll have to push through that until you look forward to doing it.

11. If your elbows start to hurt, take it easy. Change the pull up, or maybe even take a day off. Mine started being a little annoying around day 27, but I do silly things like this. This is a hard thing to do, and if you can't do it 100% in your first pass, that's alright. You're still cool if you get it done in 35 days."
"In my very first woodworking project ever, I built a freestanding ring station to work out indoors for about $40.",AntarcticanJam,735,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kibfoj/in_my_very_first_woodworking_project_ever_i_built/,1608663029.0,"This was my first time ever working with wood, save for sawing a dowel rod in half to jam my window against an AC unit.

I did not have access to any power saws, but I did have a power drill. I bought a miter guide to help me make clean 90deg and 45deg cuts, and used some macguyvering to cut rabbet joints. Not gonna lie, it was a bitch and a half to only have a hand saw and xacto knife, took way longer than it should have, and is one kipping pull up from breaking, but it suits my purposes. Normally I go to the local park and hang my rings from my favorite  sturdy tree, but the winters are colder than a yeti's didk where I live, to the point that even the thickest of gloves don't stop my fingers from going numb.

All in all I learned a lot, and can't wait to get back to my workouts. Now I have the added benefit of being able to grease the groove on some of the more difficult movements too.

Minor progress Male/ 5 months / 23yo /6' /190lbs June/ 174lbs now,swaglord974,735,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jn7kla/minor_progress_male_5_months_23yo_6_190lbs_june/,1604396780.0,"  Hey there fellas, as the title suggests this is not one of those transformations that is super impressive but I still wanted to share it with you. Before I started working out I was basically living stationary because of the lockdown and rarely got out. After my body gave me various warnings I decided to start dieting and bodyweight fitness.

  The main point I want to make in this post is that even if you don't do everything perfectly it's still better than doing nothing. I started homebrewing 3 months earlier so I regularly consume beer, I'm a chemical engineering student so fuck sleeping and being not stressed isn't an option. Being busy I can't always meet my protein goal of 200g daily and how many calories I take can be very random. And still I made some progress and I feel much healthier and stronger than before.

The before pic:[https://imgur.com/a/QIOE1hY](https://imgur.com/a/QIOE1hY)

  My program is nothing impressive, I started out doing push ups with my knees, squats and crunches, that is it. For the first 2.5 months my main goal was losing weight and I achieved my target of 170 pounds in mid August. I was doing cardio 3 times a week before my bare bones bodyweight routine and took 1200kcal a day max, although I slacked on everythin else I took dieting very seriously in this time period. My cardio routine was mainly jumping rope and shadow boxing as I have some Muay Thai experience. In mid August I started to take training more seriously and my main focus shifted to strenght training. However bare bones my training was I still gained some strength and my transition to RR was fairly smooth. The only equipment I lacked was a pull up bar and I only got one last month so my pull up progression is garbage compared to the others. My progress now is:

3x12 push ups 

3x7 parallell bar dips 

3x10 australian rows 

3x3 pull ups 

3x10 forward lunges (explosive)

3x10 single leg deadlifts 

I've added 4-5 pounds

Me now:[https://imgur.com/a/laSF5Mi](https://imgur.com/a/laSF5Mi)

  Like I said, nothing impressive but starting out I wasn't even able to do a single proper push up so this is a lot of strenght gain for me. Also I know the pictures are taken in different places but we got rid of that god awful mirror so my only option was the bathroom. 

 Lastly as for motivation love your body and yourself, even if you are out of shape and even if you are obese, you are much more inclined to care and improve things that you love. Body shaming in my experience is only demoralising and people who body shame you probably do not care about you at all and they most likely will try to put you down on other stuff too. I started working out for myself and continue to do so because I want to improve myself, I'm not working out of spite. 

Thanks for reading this post, have a nice day!"
Recommended Routine Update - again,None,733,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8ywetr/recommended_routine_update_again/,1531601948.0,"I know it's only been a month but we've decided to change things up on everyone again and put out an update to our beloved [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine). Thanks to the efforts of u/mrsylphie, u/captain_nachos, u/antranik, u/eshlow, and u/m092 we present you with the following:

**Changes to the Strength work,** [**Squat**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/squat)**, and** [**Hinge**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/hinge)

The RR is now a purely strength based routine; the warm up has changed, and the bodyline drills and skill work have been cut.

The yuri band routine has taken the place of the shoulder dislocates, an easier progression of squat/hinge exercises have been added, and finally dead bugs were added to teach bracing and replace the hollow hold.

Squats are now being paired with pull ups, hinges with dips, but don't worry push ups and rows are still together. Each strength element now includes main and alternate paths to follow as you progress.

>Example: The shrimp squat is now taking place of the deep step ups as the main squat progression. Deep step ups are listed as an [alternate path](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/squat#wiki_alternate_path_1.3A) as well as pistol squats as another [alternate path](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/squat#wiki_alternate_path_2.3A) if shrimp squats are not to your liking.

Hinging exercises have been added to round out some posterior chain work and can be done without weight, but if you can get access to some it would be to your benefit.

[**Core Triplet**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_core_triplet)

There is now a core triplet at the end of the routine consisting of [anti-extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/core#wiki_anti-extension), [anti-rotation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/core#wiki_anti-rotation), and [extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/core#wiki_extension) work. For the triplet do each exercise one by one with rest in between before repeating all 3 just like how the other exercises are done when paired. The core exercises included should help prepare you for harder skills, e.g. human flag, fl, etc. Just like the rest of the strength work the core triplet also includes main and alternate paths for each exercise.

[**Skill Day**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/skillday)

For users who have had no interest in handstands etc. you can continue skipping them like you always have. For those who do want to continue skill work the [Skill Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/skillday) routine can be worked on your rest days or worked into the RR with the warm ups added to the warm up, skills before strength, and mobility after. The Skill Day routine mainly focuses on handstands and l-sits but also includes plenty of mobility work.\*\* Note: The skill day routine will continue to grow and handstands and l-sits will not always be your only options \*\*

Like previous additions of the RR we will be in need of translations for our wiki pages if any users would like to contribute.

To sum all the routines now:

1. RR: ""I want to get strong""
2. Minimalist Routine: ""I have no time for anything but dont want to be cripple""
3. Skill Day: ""I just want to be upside down and do cool things""
4. Move: ""I want 1 and 3""

or put another way

We have the Minimalist Routine for people who don't want to die in a wheelchair, the RR is for people who just want to get strong, the Skill Day routine is for people who don't give a fuck about strength and just want to do cool looking things, and Move is for people who want both.

Please let us know of any questions or concerns you all have!

However once I started doing calisthenics exclusively during COVID (last 3 months), what I noticed most was that my lats, triceps, and traps exploded.

Lats obviously due to all the pulling. Triceps because of dips, diamond pus, ring holds, ring tricep extensions, pike pus. Just tons of tricep work in calisthenics. And lastly my traps, well I have no explanation.

Fwiw I'm using the intermediate hypertrophy routine.

Iron cross unlocked after 5 years of struggle,AFL_gains,733,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/85asod/iron_cross_unlocked_after_5_years_of_struggle/,1521374184.0,"Guys, today I achieved the iron cross- something I’ve been training ever since I started gymnastics as an adult 5 years ago. After I did it I felt almost sick with the emotion that rode over me and I cried a little. I’m just so proud and I wanted to share my excitement with all of you. Moments like these don’t come around too often and I’m glad that there is a community like this to help inspire others to do the same!! 

You can check out the video here [iron cross ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6cKXd38RE)

edit: Some people have asked for me to share how I achieved it. Here is a breif synopsis of my training methods. Note that I wasn't so regimented with training for the first 3.5 years, and probably would have got the cross sooner had I been more knowledgeable from the start.

**Training methods**:

1. First you have to be comfortable locking out your elbows. Start with pushups on your knees turning the rings out at the top. Progress to your feet when you are ready. Make sure elbows are locked at the top such that the weight is going through the elbow joint. This is super important to develop the tendon strength 

2. Next, develop a very, very solid rings support. RTO, arms locked, being able to hold it while swinging your feet etc. The pressure should be felt in the elbows. The rings support will further develop elbow strength and shoulder strength. 

3. After you have rings support, develop and work back lever. This will further engage elbows and shoulders.

4. Finally, start to scale iron cross. Do little cross ""pumps"" where you go out 10 degrees and back again for 5-10 reps

5. Iron cross block pulls are great- these can be scaled the closer the block is to your hips.

6. HEAPS of work using the cross traininers and dream machine. I used the dream machine with 20-40 kg of weight strapped to my belt and held for time (5 seconds or so). With the lower weight (10-20 kg) I did iron cross pulls.

7. When you are ready, attempt the iron cross at regular intervals (once every month or so). 

While doing the above, do plenty of shoulder and chest stuff. Ring dips, bulgarian dips, regular dips, bench press.

**Timing and sets**:

In general, i think that higher volume at lower intensity is better than lower volume at higher intensity, especially when doing iron cross. So i would do lots and lots of reps of pushups, lots of rings supports and heaps of iron cross pulls on the dream machine with 0-20 kg. Reps would be 5-10, sets would be 5-6 sets per session. I would have probably 1-2 irons cross sessions per week.

There are times when you have a session where the intensity is higher, say every month or so, but I really liked the idea of progressing slowly and getting used to a certain level by doing lots of reps. I think that's the safest thing to do.  



Edit 2:

In terms of weight/height I am 172 cm and 72 kg.

In terms of starting strength I would say I started at almost nothing - I.e I couldn’t do a muscle up and couldn’t support myself with locked arms. And for reference, When i started I was 172 cm and 72 kg hahaha

Today I did my first muscle up!,JSRF17,731,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cs06g6/today_i_did_my_first_muscle_up/,1566128345.0,"Hi!

&#x200B;

I've always been a very active person, doing sports through life. Primarily sports such as hockey, cross country skiing, running and mountainbike unicycling. I've gone to the gym every once in a while, not as often as I would have liked to, I've always found the gym to be rather boring. About 3 weeks ago I found out about calisthenics and bodyweight fitness. I read through some material about it and formed a fitness routine to be mixed in with my current mostly cardio focused routine. I also set up some goals, mostly different calisthenic moves that I wanted to accomplish, one of them being the muscle up.

&#x200B;

Before I started training for the muscle up I could do 16 chin ups, 15 pull ups and 12 regular dips. 

Today I can do 25 chin ups, 20 pull ups and 15 regular dips.

&#x200B;

I didn't think today would be the day that I would do my first muscle up. I knew that I was close, but I didn't plan on doing muscle ups today. I did one of my regular routines and at the end I thought ""why not try a muscle up?"". To my surpise, even though I was tired, I managed to do one muscle up. Now I can actually add muscle ups to my routine!

&#x200B;

Here's how my current weekly routine looks, sometimes I change a few exercises or mix up the days:

&#x200B;

I'm just really happy that I managed to do the muscle up. I know my routine isn't strictly bodyweight fitness but I thought that maybe someone could use it for some inspiration."
I'm struggling to escape the skinny fat vortex...,Dalecoop87,726,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/oon2ui/im_struggling_to_escape_the_skinny_fat_vortex/,1626862997.0,"I am a 34 year old guy blessed with a very Napoleonic stature of 5""1. Shout out to my fellow shortys.

Anywho, I am really struggling to escape the skinny fat vortex and thought i'd post here to see if i'm missing something??

Been working out on and off for about 5 years but became a bit of a slob during the months of the UK lockdown and experienced a hard break-up which didn't help eating and drinking habits. Happy days. So, I decided to get my shit together. Since Nov 2020 i've been doing bodyweight/free weight routines consistently, tracking calories and weighing myself weekly.

I'm a small guy and fairly slight but always had lots of fat around my stomach and 'love handles'. Just winning that genetic lottery all the way. Did a cut first based on working out my TDEE and settled on 1900 cals with around 90g protein (I was 8st 3 or 115 pounds when I started cut).

During the 12 week cut I made real progress on my belly and side fat, got some modest lean muscle and my back got shredded. Also had the noticeable veins in my arms which I'd always wanted. BUT, overall I was losing weight, my trousers were falling off me, neck seemed to get skinnier. It seemed the price to pay for losing the belly fat was getting more 'petite?!'

Now, I wanted to start packing on some lean muscle and in June 2021 I decided to embark on Tom Merrick's (Bodyweight Warrior YouTube) progressive, bodyweight routine for mass. [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e50bc4d1758e426f43ec5d/t/5ada0951f950b799c203cf0c/1561539492490/The+Bodyweight+Warrior+eBook+V3.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57e50bc4d1758e426f43ec5d/t/5ada0951f950b799c203cf0c/1561539492490/The+Bodyweight+Warrior+eBook+V3.pdf)

So I decided to up my calories to around 2200 a day. 5 weeks in and the belly fat has returned. I feel like I can't win!?

For info: I do at least 10,000 steps a day and on top of my hour long full body split sessions three times a week I try and squeeze two good HIIT sessions in for fat loss.

**TLDR: Skinny fat guy here, when I cut I get lean but lose weight seem to get smaller overall, when I go on a slight calorie increase the belly fat returns. I can't win, halp.**

Edit: Date started new routine

EDIT:

Did not expect this to gain so many replies. Thanks all.

Study Says: Pull-Ups Are an Abs Exercise?!?,DoomGoober,724,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/f07l3s/study_says_pullups_are_an_abs_exercise/,1581063392.0,"u/suryaengineer posted [this Jeremy Ethier video](https://youtu.be/3YvfRx31xDE), which linked to this [JPFMTS published paper](https://juniperpublishers.com/jpfmts/pdf/JPFMTS.MS.ID.555669.pdf) which states the most activated muscle in a pull up are the abs! Let's dive in:

* The study took Rectus Abdominis, Latismus Dorsi, Bicep, and Trapezius EMGs of subjects doing Pull-Ups, Machine Assisted Pull-Ups, Seated Lat Pull-Downs, and Kneeling Lat Pull-Downs. Subjects were divided into under 10 reps max and 10+ reps max.


* The study found that in all subjects, **the highest measured muscle activation during a pull-up was: the Rectus Abdominis**! Yes, the abs. I think the lower body is unstable when hanging from the bar and the balance changes as you move through the ROM. As you pull up, you move your torso and head away from the bar to avoid hitting it. This means you have to counterbalance by moving your legs/hips further in front of the bar. The RR says to move the legs forward using a hollow hold. Unfortunately, the hollow hold isolates the abs and only moves the center of mass slightly forward, making it non-ideal for beginners. I think beginners should lift their legs into an advanced tuck position (chair sit) as they pull up. This moves more mass in front of the bar and engages abs AND hip flexors which removes some strain from the overworked abs.


* In the under 10 reps max group, Machine Assisted Pull-Ups and Seated Lat Pull-Downs reduced abs activation below some other muscles. This may explain why these two exercises don't help beginners learn real pull-ups. Kneeling Lat Pull-Downs, however, maintained higher abs activation than other muscles. This suggests that kneeling lat pull-downs may be one of the best exercises to progress beginners into pull-ups. It would be interesting to see if kneeling lat pull-downs can be used to train one armed pull-ups.


* For the over 10 reps max group, abs activation remained high for all movements. However, for Machine Assisted Pull-Ups and Seated Lat Pull-Downs, bicep activation dropped noticeably. If I had to guess, people experienced at pull-ups simply don't flex their elbows fully when doing Lat Pull-Downs and Machine Assisted Pull-Ups. They may be ""cheating"" reps by leaning back, which allows the bar to touch the chest without fully flexing their elbows. Again, this indicates the activation pattern for Machine Assisted Pull-Ups and Seated Lat Pull-Downs don't carry over perfectly to pull-ups even for advanced pull-uppers.


* For pull-ups, the activations ranked in order of peak activation are: Rectus Abdominis, Biceps, Lats, Traps. For anyone who complains about ""feeling pull-ups more in the arms than the back"" it seems pull-ups ARE more of an arm exercise than a back exercise. But really, they are an abs exercise first and foremost.


**TL;DR**: Beginners should raise legs to advanced tuck NOT hollow hold. Kneeling lat pull-downs may be a good progression to pull-ups. Machine Assisted Pull Ups and Seated Lat Pull-Down are probably not great pull-up progressions for either experienced or inexperienced athletes."

730 breakfast 
1030 morning tea 
135 lunch 
545 dinner 

Its all basic food and a lot of processed meat like Devin,spam and cheese and biscuits,oats and 3 pieces of fruit a day and the stews taste like they came from the dollar store.

With all that the only positive side is you can custom your training so when you finish you can either have dinner or breakfast. 

The first 30 you don't sit with anyone, you eat alone with plastic cutlery that breaks easy and you don't even get a plastic knife or fork just a spoon.

Wake up is 5am the lights go on, and they do there morning roll call, your expected to be up and bed down within 10mins of the light and buzzer coming on, you walk out and see your neighbors.

Some are killers,rapists and some are white collar guys.

They take advantage of weakness, esp if your a fem boy, or just turned 18 and still have the boyish look,gangs are ruthless, you stick to your kind when you finish the 30 days after they evaluate you and your use to the routine they put you in the appropriate CB (Cell block).

These first 30 days are crucial to get as strong as you possibly can before entering your CB, remember you have the floor your bunk, tolite and sink that's it, the yard they put you in for 45mins a day has no equipment just basically handball courts, you have to get creative in your training and even more with the rest and recovery and try to use your time as best you can without going completely nuts. 

5am wake up,get bed down and wash your face.
Do roll call

Warm up 100 star jumps 
Stretch the major muscle groups first then the small ones so your stretch chest,back,legs,neck,shoulders,calfs,toes,forearms,fingers,biceps,triceps.

We use the stretches as a form of isometrics we hold each stretch for 10 to 15 secs.

Push ups - God makers as we like to call them, do 1 set of different types of push ups 
Standard,wide,diamonds,Spartans,incline,pikes 10-20 reps 

Triceps - get beside your bunk and get ready, tricep dips are gonna be your best friend 5 sets 20 reps 

Squats - you have to build your legs,this is where yoir power comes when you throw a punch - prisoner squats,lunges,mountain climbers 
5 sets 20 reps 

Back- you have nothing to hang from so you have to get creative, a lot of isometric holds, your bunk is bolted to the ground, go over as you where gonna perform a bent over row hold the movement for 15 secs rest for 5 repeat 6 times,

Lats-place your hands behind your head lean to one side feel the movement stretching your lat hold for 15 do the other side 10 each side. Repeat 6 times.

Also for back push ups help, but instead of focusing on your chest and tris focus on your scapula squeezing a lemon hold for 5 sec rest for 5 - ten times 5 sets.

Shoulders - arm rotation in small circles go forward then backwards, grab your tolite rolls and squeeze the day lights out of them so your forearms get a good workout too, 100 rotations 50 forward 50 reverse.

Biceps- grab your rolled up shirt or tolite roll, squeeze them place your hand your not working on the arm you are use force to stop your arm flexing focus on squeezing your biceps 10 each side 5 sets 

Biceps- put your hands together above your head, pull down and squeeze your biceps hold for 5 sec rest for 5 do this 10 times 5 sets 

Core- crunches in bunches, focus each rep squeeze your abs, you need them to be strong, nothing worse then loosing your air after you get kicked or punched in the stomach 
100 reps 

Core - planks 1 minute planks, tense your whole body don't forget to breath, raise one leg in the air, remember you got to get strong as quick as possible there's no messing around here. 10 sets alternating legs,

Finsher- no use having power and strength if you cannot produce the oxygen to help you in a fight,
burpees,star jumps,shadow boxing,jogging on the spot complete 35 - 50 reps of each.

If you knuckle down, and follow a strict regime 30 days is as good as a year, focus on each muscle contraction, when you sleep focus on you getting stronger, believe in it, if you don't you will fail, the last thing you want will happen if you don't focus and force yourself to produce results.

Things not to be bothered about when starting Calisthenics,JustCalisthenics,718,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bhxz6c/things_not_to_be_bothered_about_when_starting/,1556362810.0,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

Wanted to share this video with you. 

It can be specially useful for beginners and all guys that are starting with calisthenics/bodyweight training.

I think it's a bit different since I've tried to make it in an interesting way.

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmK3IvaI2YI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmK3IvaI2YI)

&#x200B;

Hereby you will find out what you should not be bothered about when starting calisthenics.

When you are starting calisthenics your expectations vs reality will be significantly different. But that does not mean that you should give up. Eventually you will be there just work hard and do not be bothered about next things.

Here are the 5 things not to be bothered when starting calisthenics:

&#x200B;

1.Not being able to do basic moves

It is completely normal that when you are starting with calisthenics you are not able to  perform some of the basic moves like pull ups,

push ups, dips.

In order to build strength you need to do easier variations of these exercises.

When you master them, regular moves should not be a problem, at least a couple of reps for beginning.

&#x200B;

2.Working out in public places

Don't be afraid to come and work out in public places.

There is nothing wrong that you are a beginner, that you cannot do some exercise or that you are not ripped and muscular.

Most of the people will give you support and help you with your progress.

Also you can find motivation in others and thus push even harder in order to reach higher level.

&#x200B;

3.Number of reps

Examples: pull ups, dips, push ups

&#x200B;

When you reach your max, don't sacrifice your form.

Do easier variation of exercise that you are performing.

In that way you will be more effective and eventually be able to

increase number of reps.

&#x200B;

4.Advanced moves

Don't be bothered about advanced moves when you are just starting calisthenics.

Work on foundation exercises like push ups, pull ups, dips, squats and do not try to skip this important step before starting to learn

more advanced moves.

As you get stronger and when you master your basics, advanced move will come naturally, as a next phase in your calisthenics progression.

&#x200B;

5.Compering to others

Don't be intimidated by what others in the park are doing or thinking.

You are just starting and you only need to compare to yourself.

Remember, everyone was at one pointa beginner, as you are now.

Concentrate on your progress and don't look at others.

I love building spreadsheets and build quite a few for people I know, out of enjoyment. I know there are apps etc for RR but have built a spreadsheet with some generic versions similar to RR for different schedules. Feel free to use and/or provide feedback! Also happy to build individual programs if asked nicely !      
      
These programs are very Hypertrophy focused and are relatively well designed around what we know works with Hypertrophy. They are automated and autoregulate; the guide should explain it all.

PSA: The hypertrophy rep fairy—unlike the tooth fairy—is not real,stjep,718,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g4jgt9/psa_the_hypertrophy_rep_fairyunlike_the_tooth/,1587345251.0,"One thing that gets repeated a lot in this sub is the idea of rep ranges and that specific rep ranges instil specific strength, hypertrophy or endurance effects. Most of the time that these are brought up they only mention rep ranges. No mention of intensity, volume, frequency or any other factor to do with training. Thing is that this does not appear to be true for hypertrophy.

A paper that was just accepted in the *Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research* looked at the effect of different rep regimes and loads: https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/9000/Effects_of_4,_8,_and_12_Repetition_Maximum.94415.aspx

What they did in the study was really simple. They split their untrained participants into four groups:

1. A higher load, lower rep group;

2. A medium load, medium rep group;

3. A lower load, high rep group;

4. A control group that was just plain chilling.

If you've hung around any fitness subs you will have seen people recommend #2 for hypertrophy, and #1 for strength. Or as the authors put it:

> it is believed that a training protocol with a heavier load and fewer repetitions (1–5 repetition maximum [RM]) maximizes muscle strength, whereas a training protocol with a moderate load and more repetitions (8–12RM) maximizes muscle hypertrophy

The important thing with this stud is that they kept total training volume (that is, the load × reps × sets) equated between the groups. So while the groups worked in different rep ranges and with different weights, they all did the same amount of work in their training.

After 10 weeks of training the bench press, all of the participants had a significant increase in the size of their pec major from their starting point, and from the controls who didn't train.

But the key thing was that there was no difference in muscle volume (hypertrophy) between these groups. It didn't matter if they were doing a smaller number of reps or a higher number of reps than what is typically thought to result in hypertrophy. All groups saw hypertrophy, and the effect was the same.

The place where the rep fairy did show her magic is in strength changes. 1RM was significantly greater in the low and medium rep groups than the high rep group.

So, when it comes to hypertrophy, you don't have to fuss too much over rep ranges and loads. Just make sure you work hard and the muscle volume will follow.

Thought I'd share the results given that the study was quite neat and clean. If anybody wants the full text PDF: https://send.firefox.com/download/1e2094465f41fb9e/#oEmRgZp9jYjz8rauXSI-Jw"
"I looked in depth at the original 7-minute workout research study from 2013, and there are actually lots of gotchas",bluediavolo,716,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hrlgrk/i_looked_in_depth_at_the_original_7minute_workout/,1594810505.0,"So, it took me 7 years to bother to read that original study. I've been doing the 7-min workout from time to time, during more busy times in my life, but it never really felt like enough exercise in itself. Then again, I know some people swear by it, so I decided to look at the source, and understand the reasoning behind it and how it was invented.

Here's my [longer ](https://blog.jumpycatapp.com/the-7-minute-workout-7-years-later-7-reasons-it-may-not-be-right-for-you/)[write-up](https://blog.jumpycatapp.com/the-7-minute-workout-7-years-later-7-reasons-it-may-not-be-right-for-you/): 

\- summary of the 7 gotchas

\- including quotes from the original study, and links

Like a lot of other things, the media has been blowing it a bit out of proportion, and omitted telling us about some nitty gritty details. Like the fact that even the authors themselves recommended doing multiple circuits of it (for least 20 minutes) because it only works as a 7-min workout if you can push yourself to stay \*above\* 100% of your VO2 max (which most people won't be able to sustain physically and psychologically).

The workout also includes exercises that appear simple, but a lot of people find hard to do (like push-ups). And, it's not so trivial to just replace the exercises because of the way the workout is designed to be hitting different aspects in a particular sequence and with certain intensity.

TL;DR: The 7-min workout might work, but it's not for everyone, and most likely you're doing it wrong or have the wrong expectations about it.

Disclaimer: I'm not saying you shouldn't do the workout. Based on what I've read and my own experience, I think it can be useful to build an exercising habit or to fit some (vs none) exercise when you're busy. But I can't say it's the silver bullet the media has been selling it as.

Ever tried it? What's your experience?"

I had been doing pull-ups during lockdown for a couple of months to end 2021 and decided to do 30K in 2022. 

The main sources of motivation came from @just_truett (who did 67,000 in 11 months) and @davidgoggins 

I enjoyed this challenge and was only really sore when I was pushing out consecutive 400+ rep days towards the end. 

I made sure my form was solid the whole time. I ONLY completed standard pull-ups this entire challenge with occasional ring pull-ups when I did not have access to a bar.

My hands held up pretty well once I learned to grip with my fingers not the palm of my hand. https://www.calisthenics-101.co.uk/how-to-grip-a-pull-up-bar-and-avoid-callouses
I tore my callous only once in the very beginning https://ibb.co/Rh5WrNd and my hands were fine after that.https://ibb.co/XyxQcsm (they didn't get worse than this even when I did 1000 in a day) I did need to tape my middle and ring fingers on each hand as these would take most of the friction. I later used a small leather finger pad which was easy.

In April I did 1000 in a day which I did not intend to but just kept going to 700 took a break and then did the last 300. The last 300 after a break were very challenging. 

Max reps I was my strongest in June as I was doing weighted 9kg (20lbs), sets. I was able to do 18 slow controlled reps.
I then later completed 21 later in the year. My training was focused on pure number of reps so increasing my max was not a motivator.  I could only complete 7 reps in September 2021 so I tripled my max pull-ups in a year to 21.

Injuries I was only really sore towards the end of the year. I took breaks when I needed to. I believe I was developing tennis elbow towards the end so it was hard to get going but after 100 reps I wouldn't notice it.
July/ August Rib injury due to coughing (not COVID)

Towards the end I was doing 100 in the morning, 100 at lunchtime (local park) and 200 after work.

Other activities, I cycled throughout the year, I would do some ab work, work on muscle ups, do some yoga etc. But pull-ups would have made up 85-90% of my fitness work this year if I had to guess.

I became aware that someone has done this on r/bodyweightfitness before.

Shoutout u/activeperson 

This person did not recommend doing something like this. I think that for me this challenge was great it gave me a goal and I had to pick up slack if I started to get off track. I was only feeling like I wasn't recovering towards the end. 

Physique changes, I have previously been much stronger in my early 20s and I am now 31. I got great development in my forearms, biceps, and back. 

I thought I would put this post up as I think we sometimes make things too complicated. My goal was simple do 30,000 pulllups this year.

Do gymnasts care about their bodies? How do they get such big biceps? How good are street workout athletes?

Why am I not progressing? How long til I'm good? How good can I get?

Why is mobility important? Is it even if I don't care about being flexible? 

What are basic moves to strive for? How should I eat? 

I was very impressed and left with a lot to think about

*Note: Sommer is known for being a bit of an inflammatory dick outside of gymnastics-- he stays in his wheelhouse, you would never guess. The last 5 minutes about probiotics are kinda weird*

I saw this post to this site:

and a comment which said

""The idea that it's expensive to eat healthy is an absolute myth. It's actually cheaper to eat healthy if you buy the right things. More often than not it used as an excuse by people who don't really want to change and want to be able to justify that.""

Which makes me wonder, what exactly is the ""right things"" and furthermore what exactly do the meals look like? What is the ""healthiest"" diet you can make on a budget of $80 - $120 per month per single individual? For 4 meals a day and 30 days/month that is $1 per meal on the top end of that range. What's the ""healthiest"" option for that? something resembling gruel for every meal? All the stuff I find easily blows past $1. I notice some other comments mention stuff about things like tuna, etc. but I think on previous trips to grocery stores it seems that came out as surpassing the $1/meal threshold that this budget requires. And the OP of the linked thread did not give a budget point either."

Starting stats(in the video): 32M 6'1 203 lbs

Ending: 33M 6'1 180 lbs

I've been losing weight since april, but around june/july, i decided I wanted to actually get fit, build some strength, muscle, endurance and speed. So I started working out in earnest. 

**Workout:** I explored various programs(including the RR(just not for me, please dont hurt me)), eventually putting together my own, stuff I enjoy which focused on dumbells and bodyweight. I have zero interest in joining a gym. Basically I rotate working back and legs, and arms and chest. I do this work out 3 times a week, MWF. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I spend some time on the elliptical. And one day a week, on the weekend, I run a 5k. Im almost sub 30 mins!

Edit: What my workout is MOSTLY like (I made this at the start, and it varies) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8sibLja2-Uxr_YJ7ujuH66xjSUo3tiB5WsxXzKgkgY/edit?usp=sharing

**My diet:** Kept it simple with CICO, while trying to eat about 150 grams of protien a day. 1000 calorie deficit at the start. Then when I started working out, I lowered it to around 300-500. I just couldn't do anything when I was on that huge deficit. And its even harder these days! But I get ever closer to my goal of 15% BF.

**For pull ups**, it was pretty straight forward. I used the traditional techniques. I'd say negatives and inverted rows were the most important. I didn't get much benefit from using bands for assisted pull ups. It just felt too awkward. 

Going forward, I'll continue working on bodyweight stuff. I can do diamond push ups now! I suppose I'll have to get a barbell at some point, or at least a new set of adjustable dumbells (I've nearly maxed out my 50 pounders). Eventually, my ultimate goals are 20 pull ups with good form, a sub 20 minute 5k and a super hero esk physique. Its a big ask and those goals may be mutually exclusive. But there is no harm in aiming big!

Edit: Wow. Yesh. Ya'll are great! Advice taken on board. I suppose this got a huge response because you don't see a lot of schlubby guys in their 30s putting themselves out there. But I think we are the silent masses. I hope they are encouraged, and less apt to excuse making (thats what the fat loss/muscle gain comment is for at the end). I think being realistic is important, and as long as you're just honest with yourself and give the effort, you got nothin to be ashamed of. Thats YOU deciding that. 

I'll do a follow up at the one year mark (hopefully Ill still be at it). Thanks for the encouragement."
3 years of doing LOTS of push ups and pull ups,iSwim44,713,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4kl3m5/3_years_of_doing_lots_of_push_ups_and_pull_ups/,1463959633.0,"PICS for the impatient: http://imgur.com/a/0vJI5

I'm mostly posting this because I see a lot of people asking 
questions like, ""How much can I actually achieve just doing/using _____ for my exercise?"" Well, here's what I have achieved with 3 years of just doing lots of push ups, pull ups, sit up variations, running/sprinting. The first image is from when I was on my high school swim team, I was lean as hell but I don't know what my body fat percentage was. In those days I did the same daily routine I do now but I also swam every morning and afternoon which is why it was so low. The last few pictures is what I have achieved with calisthenics and with the goal of being as healthy and to live as long as possible, not to get big or anything, just be to feel good all the time. My body fat percentage is 4% (I can provide proof of this if needed) in the pictures of me when I stopped swimming. Sorry in advance if I broke any rules or anything! 

Edit#1: definitely didn't expect so many people trying to put me down. Sorry I didn't provide ""proof"" right away of the 4% body fat. I didn't realize how up-tight people were about the specifics. I'll post a picture of the document later tonight. Definitely not posting in this community ever again. Thanks for the warm welcome. 

Edit#2: Here's the results of the test I took. I mis-spoke, it was actually 3.7% body fat: http://imgur.com/a/74Zs9

Edit#3: Thanks for all the kind and constructive comments everybody :) Something I didn't mention earlier is THIS ROUTINE HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH A STRICT DIET SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING. And also, I didn't really think about genetics in this case but someone pointed out to me that not everyone can achieve a nice body doing a minimal style routine like mine and that's probably true. Sorry for not thinking of that when I first posted this, I really just wanted to help motivate people to go get outside and do something active because these are the kinds of posts that inspire me and I just wanted to contribute to the community a little bit. Next time I post I'll be more careful, I honestly didn't realize how much people care about body fat %. If you guys want to know more about my diet let me know. But when I say clean I just mean I do the basics. Eat lots of protein and vegetables with SOME carbs. No, I don't completely cut out carbs. For snacks I eat fruits, nuts, yogurt. Stuff like that. I have eaten broccoli, sweet potatoes, chicken and fish for almost every meal for 3 years now but I do cheat once a week. I tried to reply to everyone but to those of you I didn't, thanks again for you comment/constructive criticism. Hopefully this post motivated at least one person to be active today, that's all I wanted in the first place. "

100 Push-up Challenge at 50 BPM,Alpha-Panda,710,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/be169j/100_pushup_challenge_at_50_bpm/,1555459754.0,"The notorious 100 push ups is commonly a goal attributed with mastering the push up. Not many get there but those that do surely earn bragging rights. And that’s exactly what the challenge I have in mind is: 100 nonstop push ups.

What’s the catch?

Doing it at 50 beats per minute. Every metronome click signals down, every other signals up (as such, completing the entire 100 should take 4 minutes). That being said, this is INFINITELY harder than simply doing 100 consecutive push ups. This provides for a killer shoulder, chest, and tricep workout all in one. 

The Challenge in a Nut Shell:

Goal: last as long as possible following a 50 beat per minute metronome. One push-up is completed every 2 ticks. To ‘beat’ the challenge, you must complete 100 nonstop push ups obeying the following:

Rules

*its preferable, but not required to tuck elbows in rather than out 

-Hands can not leave the floor 

-Lagging behind metronome pace results in disqualification

-No excessive butts in the air (or sagging for that matter)

-Chest must at most be 2 inches from the floor on every push up 

-you should make a dead stop both at the bottom and at the top of your push up 

And that’s it. The difficulty of the challenge shouldn’t be underestimated - it’s a mental journey to say the least, and you’d be surprised how taxing a matter of minutes can be on nearly your entire upper body.

[Here’s the metronome I used to do the challenge](https://youtu.be/jYCppV1bhy4)

Hey guys, I decided to do another update since I received a few messages from people who got inspired to start training from my last update (which was well over an year ago).

A lot of stuff happened to me during the past year and I would like to share some of them with you since you were the ones who motivated me to start.
Basically, my progress started with me, breaking up with the girflriend mentioned in my last update. That put me in a really bad spot, given that I already had some issues to begin with. What it also did was make me lose a ton of weight from simply not eating. I went from 106 to 82 kg in an year, which is a 24 kg loss (around 53lbs), without any physical activities. Mentally, I am still a wreck, and I also started smoking and drinking pretty heavily, but I managed to get out of it to a certain degree thanks to /u/3lvy. She was always there when I needed someone and I must thank her for that.

After all of that, recently I realised that I am a lot lighter. At first I didn't have strength but I started the beginner routine again and in a month I managed to land 20 clean push ups, and around the same amount of pull ups. I gave up on the alcohol and I started bouldering and sport climbing, as well as running. Last week I nailed my first 10k (with a lot of breaks, but I still feel like it's a personal achievement). I've also recently began training for more advanced calisthenics moves, like the front and back lever. I would love to get a weighted vest, so I can start attempting a one armed pull up, since it really helps in climbing. I also began grip training and have progressed from a 20kg gripper to a 100kg one (44lbs, 220lbs, respectively). I guess that I have never been in better physical condition, if we count out the cigarettes.

A simple advice that I can give to anyone that wants to start training is that you should never focus entirely on your body. Your mind is of great importance, even when it comes to physical health. It can be the missing link that makes you move forward, but it can also be your greatest enemy. No matter how much motivation you've previously had, you can still blow everything away if you slip, and yet, regardless of that it's never too late to try again. Best of luck on achieving your goals!

With that said, I wonder how far I will go this time. I want to get in shape for a half marathon by spring next year and I plan on actively continuing my climbing endeavours. Will keep you updated if I make any significant progress.

Well Just for fun I went through another book he's featured in, Living With A Seal, and compiled the body weight workouts Goggins does.

[I originally compiled these for my website, but figured I'd share them here as well.](https://miloandthecalf.com/2016/07/29/david-goggins-inspired-bodyweight-work-outs/) Obviously these are all individual work outs and not meant to all be done at once.

100 Burpees for time

Under ten minutes = solid.

Under 11 minutes = decent

Takes you longer than 13 minutes? = do it again

**Push up Ladder I**

One push up, wait 15 seconds; Two push ups, wait 15 seconds, etc. till 10 push ups

At ten push ups, wait 30 seconds between sets. Go to eighteen. For extra fun, so back down, 18 to one.

**Push Up Progression**

"Climbing trees is a workout by itself, and one of the most ""functional"" forms of Calisthenics",BrrrManBM,707,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/uq5dm0/climbing_trees_is_a_workout_by_itself_and_one_of/,1652618804.0,"Have any of you tried climbing a thin branchless tree? Something like a beech or a palm tree?

It is unlike climbing city walls or anything else. Thigh adductor and lat soreness is out of this world. I am telling you... Also, wrists? Omg...

Started doing it after cycling during ""recovery"" days and it is incredible. Small steps... Long rest. Slow, controlled movements. Builds connective tissue, mobility and coordination like nothing.

So, for all of you who are sorta into those kind of activities, I say... Look up the technique online, consult a friend or whatever and hit the outdoors.

 The rest is on you to figure out. Good luck!

EDIT:       Since this post is gaining lots of attention, unexpectedly, I have to make this clear, because it seems not so obvious to the majority of commenters;

This is not a call for mindlessly climbing high trees. It was just an observation presented in the heat of my excitedness from climbing a tree - a mere suggestion for another modality of training, of achieving or supplementing fitness.

That being said, the same philosophy still applies to climbing skinny trees as with all on life. As with learning a trade, a subject in school, as with training for a sport, practicing new calisthenics movement... Especially parkour. You would not start working on pull ups by doing muscle ups, but by hanging... Off a straight bar... Then doing some shrugs. Then after a week or two you might try to hold assisted top position. In parkour, one should start and stay on he ground forr a while, crawling, holding onto walls supported by feet on the ground... And so on... In order to condition their body for possible challenges. Some of us need directions. That I did not give nor do I intend to after this. Anything is best learned by investing yourself in it, trying to come up with your own solutions and individual approach to understanding, growth, practice... And climbing skinny trees seemed like it made my body form shapes it was not used to, but desperately needed to get accustomed to in order to correct flat feet and weak back, inflexible adductors, weak false grip ...

So, the point is... Or better said TLDR; Start small, build up, don't climb (higher than your head level), just hang, feel the tree, train the muscles... And as you and if you get more curious, confident, strong, then you might think about climbing any significant height from which if you fell down to the ground, you wouldve gotten hurt.

Hope this does not reduce any good willed comments that point out safety concerns, but makes future like minded commenters think and write about this low level approach and fitness benefits of just another way of movement our body is capable performing."

Chatted with an ex-gymnast and Red Bull Cliff diver about his fitness routine - here were the takeaways,ABrotherAbroad,704,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9zza23/chatted_with_an_exgymnast_and_red_bull_cliff/,1543073113.0,"I had the chance to chat with a Redbull Cliff Diver/Cirque Du Soleil performer/ex gymnast this week about how to stay fit and build muscle using only calisthenics.  He boiled it down to 5 moves for upper body.  Granted, they’re not all bodyweight exercises (e.g., reverse muscle ups) but his perspective was great to hear.

- Muscle Ups 
- Reverse Muscle Ups (using a barbell or suspension trainer )
- Handstand Holds - only “nose and toes” touching the wall (3-5 minutes)
- Front Lever
- Back Levers 

According to him and his coaches, if you can do those you’ll have bulletproof fitness that you can keep going with into old age.  He recommended a 2 day split aiming for 5x10 of each exercise and do it every day until your body feels like you need a break.

For lower body he recommended front squats with the same approach, and a power exercise of your choice, but avoid back squats as they add no additional value but destroy posture for most people. Pistols seem to be the most logical and suitable replacement for front squats

Note: This is just the takeaway from a conversation with one guy (who gets paid well to train people), so take it for what it’s worth and research on your own - but I thought it was a great alternate approach to fitness instead the normal gym routine and supportive of the bodyweight fitness approach 

- EDIT -

There were a ton of questions about the workout? The movements, and the overall program so I recorded some videos from the workout and wrote a full post on it.  Hope it gives someone some good ideas. Good Luck

**EDIT 2:**  Moving on now :).  I'm perfectly healthy and in that picture above I'm hanging out in my new *[Batman Cave gym](https://flic.kr/p/2iK6Nu2)* which I set up a couple of days ago.  I was hanging inverted with a 28lbs/13kg weighted vest for about a minute.  The new gym is a work in progress, and I have a lot of equipment still on order.  So far:  Rings and a climbing rope with a 10ft/3m ceiling - perfect for 360 Pulls, Hang Pull to Inverted, etc.  The pull-up bar is rated for 500lbs so my weighted pull-ups to +130lbs will be fine, weighted Adv Tuck FL rows +65lbs, etc. I have my pull-up grips on the ledge and I have a fat bar setup to go from the standard 1.25"" to 2.125 and then 3.5"" dia. for pull-ups!   If you look closely on the ceiling you see two pulleys mounted on either side of the ring straps which will go with the loading pins against the wall for a counter-weight system to help me work on more advanced elements like the Iron Cross, Maltese, Planche and even the infamous Victorian.

Main goal is to complete the one set of 50 or 100 reps 

Workout A - Dips - curls - pike push ups 
Complete 100 or 50 reps as quick as possible on each excersise with limited rest.

Workout B - step ups - rows - jumping jacks

Another Pullup Goal Achieved - 45lbs Weighted Pullups for 10 Reps,SelfiesSuck,702,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nl0rnq/another_pullup_goal_achieved_45lbs_weighted/,1621978822.0,"Link to Video: [https://youtu.be/siqWTnJAaOM](https://youtu.be/siqWTnJAaOM)  


Stats: 5'10"", 172lbs/78kg Bodyweight, lifting for about 4 years.  


For most of my lifting journey, I've focused on bodyweight pullups, but a couple of months ago I set a goal to get 10 reps with 45lbs hanging from my waist. Here's how I achieved it.

  
Training: Two pullup days a week with the same set and rep scheme for both days,

5 sets of Pullups to Failure with a goal to get 10 reps in AT LEAST one set. If I could get 10 reps, I would increase the weight by 2.5lbs the following week. Rinsed and repeated until I got to 45lbs for 10 reps. Note that I started at around 30lbs for 10 reps.

This program makes you do 10 HARD sets of pullups a week at a challenging intensity. Give it a shot and let me know if it works for you!"

We received such great feedback from you and interest in the app that we have decided to develop a complete list of all bodyweight exercises and add more content with that focus. 

It was clear from our [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/97luov/over_400_bodyweight_exercise_ideas/) that there are not many good resources (especially free) to find exercises and progressions for calisthenics/gymnastics. Our goal is to add more bodyweight exercises to the main database and applications, but also to make an app in the near future just focused on bodyweight fitness and the exercise progressions.

We have prepared a list of both groups, along with the existing bodyweight exercises already in our database. We were hoping you could help us make sure we have a complete master list of exercises and progressions. Please take a look at the lists and leave your comments here or PM me. We will keep it updated as we get feedback and once it is completed will start adding the content and creating the apps.

Muscular endurance is underrated/under-appreciated,tsf97,708,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/zv49n5/muscular_endurance_is_underratedunderappreciated/,1671995061.0,"Thought I would throw this out there.

Even in calisthenics, which was conceived as a bodyweight sport, there seems to be a huge bias towards hypertrophy and strength - 90% of people who get to 10-15 pull-ups almost always exclusively just start adding weight and  as they get stronger keep adding more and more weight rather than increasing reps, and don’t push beyond the 8 or so rep range. I understand that some people prioritise mass gain and raw strength etc however I think many are missing out on many advantages exclusive to training higher rep sets with just their own bodyweight. 

If you want to get into sports like climbing, gymnastics, or ninja warrior, muscular endurance is much more important as those sports are just a case of holding on as long as possible to the bar or wall etc. Training endurance helps your body adapt to things like lactic acid management and also can improve things like dead hangs and grip etc. (lower rep heavier sets don’t improve grip as much as they’re much shorter time hanging). All of which are very important across a lot of different disciplines. Endurance workouts also improve general fitness as they’re far more cardiovascular and burn more calories also. 

If you also want to get your pull-ups into the really high ranges like 40-50+ then endurance training is crucial (60-70% of your max bw reps for 5+ sets is what I always do); many guys think because they can do 100lb pull-ups that they can do that many already but can’t because they don’t have enough training on things like prolonged grip endurance and their arms start burning much sooner than they expect. 

I have also personally found through myself and friends that endurance translates much better to strength than the other way round. A lot of climbers can do one arm pull-ups with little to no training despite training almost exclusively endurance (I got my OAP out of nowhere), while I’ve seen a lot of guys who exclusively train strength and can do very heavy weighted pull-ups for 4-5 reps but struggle to hang on a bar for a minute. 

I also think that training exclusively very heavy weights for low reps puts you at much higher risk of injuries, especially tendonitis as tendons get more aggravated by high load rather than high repetitions. Replacing some of these heavy sets with lighter/higher rep sets can reduce the incidence of this. 

I’m not necessarily saying that training one is better than the other. Strength training has huge benefits like on your rapid fire neurons and fast twitch muscle fibres, explosive pulling power, as well as one arm pulling which is beneficial for many sports. But my point is the difference in skills you gain from training each style provides a strong argument to diversify one’s training programme with calisthenics; you get the best of both worlds while limiting the downsides of training in one particular way. 

Over the last year I started training one strength and one endurance session per week per muscle group (except legs where I do mainly plyometrics as I don’t want bulky legs for my sport), and the progress I’ve seen has been huge despite me having trained many years already. 

Train however makes you feel good or what is appropriate for your sport or your goals (obviously if you’re a pro power lifter then just keep doing what you’re doing lol) but I thought I would just mention this as many people I know switched from strength only to strength/endurance (some due to overuse injury) and are really enjoying the additional benefit from training their own bodyweight."
I finally got the Human Flag after 6 months! Mostly thanks to the advice from this sub!,PuscOverDose,705,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/p6wa67/i_finally_got_the_human_flag_after_6_months/,1629308883.0,"sex: male, weight: 91kg at the beginning, 85kg in the end, height: 183cm 
 
 Basically around 6 months ago I sort of lost motivation with the gym so I had to look for ways to regain that motivation and what I found out about was calisthenics skills. Decided to tackle on the human flag as it simply looks so cool. Not going to lie at the beginning I wasn't even sure if it was achievable for me, as I was around 91kgs but after I lost ~6kgs and trained on a push/pull/core split for 6 months I managed to get it. I could've probably got it a whole lot sooner but I barely changed my diet at all (I don't pay that much attention to nutrition, ikr...not a wise choice but I simply don't have the self control to give up all the sweets "":D"") 
 
Things that I found out most helpful:
 
Firstly getting a solid foundation of overhead pushing and pulling strength. The exercises I used for this were:
- Handstands (against the wall)/ 1 arm handstands (against the wall) but I replaced those with Military presses after gyms opened again. 
- Dips --> Weighted dips as I got stronger (5 sets, usually around 5 reps weighted)
- Pull ups and chin ups (close grip, neutral grip, wide grip, commando pull ups) (5-8 sets, changed grips weekly, usually around 6 reps per set). Also learned L sit chin ups and started doing them at the beginning of my pullday workouts 
- Australian pull ups (ring rows) 3 sets, 6-12 reps depending on the angle 
- Planche leans (3 sets, didnt measure the lean amount but I did notice gradual improvement)
- Seated Shoulder Press (3 sets, around 12 reps per set)
 
For obliques I mainly just did Side planks (statics) and side plank raises on elbow as well as weighted side bend (putting a dumbbell overhead and then just turning to the side (can be found on Dan Jeong's side lever obliques training video) and some hanging knee raises (twisting to sides). I tried windshield wipers but they felt really weird and uncomfortable for me lol, maybe I'm just not strong enough? who knows. But all I needed to get the flag were those 3 exercises. I only started really focusing on my obliques after like 4-5 months of training, wish I had done that sooner. I did 5 sets for each exercise. 
 
I made a video (mostly for my irl mates who were there along the entire journey) and it was actually quite nice seeing the progress myself as well, not just feeling it. I don't expect you guys to watch the entire 11min video posted by some random user here so I'll timestamp some notable attempts in case you guys are interested.

1 Year Progress Report,None,701,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dnqzk5/1_year_progress_report/,1572167561.0,"**FITTER HAPPIER**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I started my bodyweight fitness journey 1 year ago aged 43 after having not done any exercise since my late twenties and no weight training whatsoever. This post will attempt to describe that journey, and in so doing hopefully serve as inspiration for people, especially those who are a little older, who are considering taking up this incredible sport.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To say that I started 1 year ago is not completely true. I actually started 1 year before that, but I only lasted a frenetically naive two months before completely unsurprisingly injuring my shoulder. I fell out of the habit of exercising and back into my comfortable life of questionable vices until, in September last year, I promised myself for the hundredth time that I was finally going to get fit. This time, for whatever reason, I’ve mostly kept my promise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Upon starting my bodyweight fitness journey for the second time I was determined to not make the same mistakes again. I needed to educate myself. I needed [r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/). My main takeaway was to this time do the opposite of what I did the first time – namely to start slow and to build a base of strength before attempting anything more adventurous. And that is what I did. I started following the RR at the end of September 2018, and barely made any changes until I was 8 months in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I did injure my shoulder again in January but this time I was sufficiently invested in calisthenics to only stop for the 6 weeks that I needed to heal. I came back from my injury a fair bit weaker than before, but because I was then, as I am now, a complete beginner, it only took me a few weeks until I was back to where I left off. It was also around this time that I finally started to feel the gains in strength that my slowly increasing reps were pointing to. Up until then my shaky 5 pull ups felt as weak as my shaky single pull up did 5 months before. But suddenly things were different, something had clicked. My steady adherence to the RR was actually building a small but tangible base of strength. I only wished that my increased numbers were not just being newly felt, but also newly shown. Unfortunately, at that stage, any changes to my musculature were hard for even me to see.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My next big change came in May of this year, 7 months in. I bought myself some rings and they completely changed both the way I worked out and my enjoyment of said workout. Everyone always says that rings are a humbling tool, and they certainly were for me. My first few weeks of using them made me feel like I had regressed by months and left me with aches in muscles I didn’t even know I had. But slowly my strength and technique caught back up and, if anything, my numbers started to increase faster with the rings than they had before.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I’m sure is the case with everyone, the newfound possibilities of movement that the rings opened up to me inspired me to start trying a few more adventurous exercises. I started to experiment with skin the cats, ring L-sits and levers, and I adjusted my routine to accommodate the learning of these new kills. I had long found Harops curls incredibly taxing on my knees so I removed them from my routine and replaced them with ring bicep curls. I also started to do arch body holds, scapular pulls and skin the cats at the end of my workout to try and build some straight arm strength to help in my acquisition of the front lever. I also started doing archer pushups and ring turned out dips, as well as doing my rows with false grip.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, although a lot of fun, the extra volume had a negative effect on almost all of my exercises and, after training this way for a month, I realised that I was again getting ahead of myself. I needed an ego check. I stopped, took a step backwards, and re-focused on the basics. I just wasn’t ready for what I was trying. I stopped doing the front lever work at the end of my workout but kept everything else. A soon as I did my numbers increased again. I was getting really strong at archer pushups and RTO dips, but my pull ups, as ever before, were the slowest to improve.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In July I did the Russian fighter pull up program for one month. My pull up max at that stage was 7/8, but at the end of the month I could do 12. Although not such a large increase as some have documented, I was very happy nonetheless. I did the pull ups every morning while getting my kids ready for school, and then on the way home from work I would stop by the river, hang my rings from a tree, and complete the rest of my routine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the next month I continued with my routine as it was. In this period, I had a family holiday for three weeks in Sri Lanka and my rings travelled with me! It was amazing being able to do my routine on the beach with my rings hanging from a palm tree. It just goes to show what a versatile piece of equipment they are. At the end of the month I was starting to feel really strong. I was steadily increasing my numbers (not my pull ups though!) and my body was finally starting to show some development of its own. Inspired by my newly emerging muscles I decided to finally step away from the RR. I invested in a weight belt and weights and created for myself an upper/lower hypertrophy routine that I followed until 1 week ago, when I was forced to stop because of a few recurring niggles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I will detail this routine later in the post, but I based it around the concept of drop sets. My total volume increased dramatically; whereas before with the RR I was doing 12 sets of upper body exercises for around 96 total reps, I was now doing, at the end of the two months, 36 sets totalling about 216 reps, 8 sets of which were weighted! This probably explains why I am currently resting and not able to exercise. But in the last two months I felt the most significant increases in strength of the whole year, as well as noticing a small but noticeable increase in size. The program consisted of weighted pull ups, weighted ring dips, front lever work, HSPU work, rows and PPPU.

**SIT DOWN. STAND UP**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I followed the RR pretty religiously up until the 10th month, when I switched to a hypertrophy routine that I loosely based on the concept of drop sets. This routine (which I followed for two months) increased my strength and also gave me the largest gains in muscle growth that I experienced in the last year. It is an upper/lower split. There is a lot of volume (for me at least) and the upper part took me on average 1.5 hours to complete. The lower body days were much shorter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The table here represents my finishing figures, I started with lower weight and/or easier progressions and worked my way up. I kept the rep ranges mostly the same throughout. Obviously, if someone were to follow this routine, they could easily adjust the progressions and weight to suit their level.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Exercises to be done in pairs. So weighted pull ups and dips 2x3, followed by weighted pull ups and dips 2x6 ad finally pull ups and dips 2x10. Then the next pair.

**KNIVES OUT**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’ve always eaten well, both in quantity and quality. I became a vegetarian (although the rubbish kind that still eats fish) 3 years ago. I don’t miss meat one bit and the only change which I made upon commencing calisthenics, was to take a protein shake on the days I exercised.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I decided to try bulking for the first three months, and although I put on a surprising amount of weight in that time, I’m not sure how much of that was muscle. I say that I’m not sure because it took me so fucking long to lose the body fat that I gained (started of skinny fay anyway), that by the time, 7 months later, when I had finally lost some of the fat, it was impossible to say for certain whether the small gains were made during my bulk or in the 7 months cut that followed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, bulking was a mistake! I should have cut first and then gone for a lean bulk. I think had I been ten years younger I could have lost the weight much faster. But that belly fat is frustratingly hard to remove the older you get! I was not making any progress in removing it and the only thing that eventually worked for me was intermittent fasting. I fasted for 18 hours a day and after just over a month my belly fat was at respectable levels. In total I gained 6.3Kg over the year, but when the loss of belly fat is calculated in, I think my gains come out a bit higher.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m not going to go into great detail about what I ate, as that for most people is a personal choice, but I will give a few tips!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On the days that I exercised, especially when working out first thing and fasted, I would almost always have the same meal directly after. 200g Quark or Skye mixed with 200g Yoghurt, plus 300g oats, plus mixed berries, chopped bananas and chia seeds. When eaten with a protein shake this meal would total around 90g of protein and would fill me up for a good few hours.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Protein bread is amazing, almost 10g protein a slice and tastes fantastic. Lunch was often salmon sandwiches with this stuff. Or on the side of a grilled veg platter, or quinoa salad. For dinner I’d cook Indian food three times a week, dals being cooked the most often to make use of the wonderful lentil. Veg chilis featured strongly, pasta bakes and frittatas too. At the weekends huge plates of eggs with avocado and tomato, mushrooms and smoked salmon!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the moment I am testing out veganism. I have made it 6 weeks now and I intend to keep the test going for a few weeks more yet. I don’t want to start a discussion here, but at the moment I’m leaning towards staying with vegetarianism (though without the fish) as I’m finding it incredibly inconvenient and time consuming to eat enough each day. Plus, I’m almost bored with the amount I’m farting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As far as counting calories go, no, didn’t do it. Perhaps that explains why it took me so long to lose the weight? Perhaps. I just don’t have the patience for it. Perhaps I should, but I doubt I will. I also made a few changes to my lifestyle at the beginning, but my comfortable old habits have started to slowly insinuate their way back into my life. I’ve always lived my life to the full, and even though I’m now married with two amazing kids, I still like to indulge occasionally. At the beginning I actually stopped drinking and smoking for three months. But in January, when I had a six-week layoff due to injury, I found myself less empowered to prevent myself starting again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the moment I only smoke when I drink, and I only drink once or twice a month. But when I do, it is almost always more than just a couple of pints. I know that I probably shouldn’t, especially the smoking, but I honestly enjoy it and I’m not beating myself up about it too much. I have an all or nothing personality and would not be surprised if in the coming years I knock both on the head entirely. In the meantime, I’ve started supplementing my light drink and drugs habit with some mild cardiovascular exercise. I have been running 3 times a week for the last two months and can now run 10km relatively comfortably. My increased conditioning has definitely had a positive effect on my calisthenics.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I WILL**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My goals for the coming year are definitely skill based. I feel that I have built a moderate base of strength and I want to see if I can use that to learn a couple of fancy moves. I can already do a 7 second advanced tuck front lever, and I hope that in 12 months’ time I will have achieved the full version. If I do it sooner, then I will work on the back lever. I definitely intend to try for a ring muscle up, on the bar as well. I have been practicing my false grip, but on the infrequent times when I’ve tried to do one, I have felt myself to be nowhere close. I have heard that the muscle up is as much about technique as it is strength, but I’ve always felt that my pull ups have lagged behind everything else and that perhaps I just need to get yet stronger first. Handstands. I really want to get a handstand by the end of the year. I can do a couple shaky reps of HSPUs against a wall, so suspect I have the strength and just need to consistently work on my form and balance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have no idea how to program a routine to accommodate these goals, whilst also continuing to build some strength, so feel free to add any suggestions in the comments! As soon as I have recovered from my current niggles I will be diving into it and I am super excited to change my routine up and to start focusing on skills as well as strength.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2+2=5**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I said at the beginning, my main motivation for writing this post was to provide a little inspiration for other people of middle age who were considering starting calisthenics. There are hundreds of progress reports out there, but almost all of them are from 16 year old boys which show transformations which, although spectacular, are unachievable for most people over 40. I wanted to show what is actually possible at this age. What can be achieved while balancing family life, work and play. A more realistic aspirational post for the middle aged!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have gone from zero to something in a year. I feel so much stronger than when I started. My mood is noticeably improved. My posture is better and my physique has also changed. I started off having to force myself to exercise, but I now find it very hard to stop. Routine is key. Just get out there and do it. Stop planning. Stop asking questions. Stop waiting until you have researched and bought that last key bit of equipment. Get outside and start. And then do it again two days after that, Then again two days later.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And keep your goals realistic. Don’t compare yourself to others, especially not to the progress of a testosterone boosted 16-year old! Compare yourself to yourself. Make sure that in two days’ time you can say to yourself that today I am a little stronger than I was two days ago. The only goal you really need to set yourself is that of exercising in two days’ time. Everything else, all the other things that you want to achieve, will follow from this simple premise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It is ok to dream, to watch youtube videos of calisthenics experts doing crazy moves. It is perfectly fine to imagine a future where you too can perform a front lever, a planche (not likely in my case!) or a human flag. It is absolutely allowed to browse [r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/) for inspiration, advice and knowledge, but don’t hold yourself to everything you see, hear or read. Don’t expect to be anyone but a better, fitter and stronger version of yourself. But know that your dreams are achievable, but only through a process of slow, incremental improvements, and that the sooner you start improving, the closer you will be to your dreams. Just fucking start already!

&#x200B;

So that is the year that was. I am super happy with the progress I made and I can’t wait to see where I will be in a year’s time. I would love to hear your comments on any aspect of this post and will do my best to answer any questions that you guys might have. **Bring it on!**"
Monkey Bars at a kids playground can be super humbling,Drunk_monk37,702,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9ml26b/monkey_bars_at_a_kids_playground_can_be_super/,1539049975.0,"So I've been going to the Gym for a while, can do 5 pull ups, and 5 chin-ups (still pretty tubby though).

While at the playground with my boy I thought I would nail the monkey bars, after all if I can pull myself up, surely I can swing across the monkey bars.  The short answer is nope.

I got 3 swings at best, and struggled to do it.

The good news is I have a new body-weight challenge to conquer, and good motivation to take the boy to the playground.

About 4 months ago, I decided to fight back to retake my youth discipline. After multiple struggle and procrastination, I achieved to wake up at 4h30 every morning and complete my bodyweight workout(and much more). The progress is pretty much unbelievable for my body and my life. (Sorry  no before  / after pic)

 I was always kinda 'fit' by genetics, but never ripped. A beer belly was trying to settle for a few years now...  I took OG2 on Amazon and it was the workout companion I've always wish for :) otherwise kettlebell and my sets or parallets was all I needed.

I hope this post will motivates a few to keep going! Best of luck! 

Obligatory edit;

Body stats: 160lbs, 5'8, 33yo

Detailed diet ; I made sure to never skip a Meal. I did consume some proteins supplements at the beginning, but the main change is I skipped carbohydrates in most meal ; no pasta, no bread, but double the proteins.  I still have a weakness for a good cold beer... So there's room for improvement.

My (morning) Daily routine is (in correct order) ; L-Sit Pull-ups (9,9,8,7), lvled Planche pushups (3x20 on parallets), Lvled Dips (3x25 on parallets), L-sit (3x30sec on parallets), Jump through (3x12 on parallets), Swing (3x12 on parallets), Frog stand (3x20Sec on floor), Kettlebell  35lbs 1 arm swing in alternation, (2x40). The whole thing takes me roughly 1h-1h30. I always do it with an empty stomach ( I always drink 1 full glass of water prior and 1 full glass while training). Then I jump in the shower and (then I) eat breakfast. 

As for additional pictures, I might try to update some in a different post, as for my frog stand posture and L-sit form.  As for my next goal, I'm heading toward Advanced-Frog stand, one step a time :) My objective is to get to a full planche...

Thanks for your supports guys, It means a lot to me!"
A word on strength training.,None,700,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/19j6i2/a_word_on_strength_training/,1362248761.0,"**[Read this article too](http://www.higher-faster-sports.com/nonfunctionalmyth.html).**

Occasionally, we see a question on this subject, and I never have the time to explain it in as much detail as I would like. So, I decided to post this in hope that some of you would learn from it, and that the knowledge you may gain will benefit you :)

Before you read on, I must point out that if you're more advanced, than you probably already know most/all of this. This is aimed towards beginners looking to learn more.

There are multiple ways to increase strength. These include (but are not limited to):

* Increasing the size of myofibrils (specifically, type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers) aka **myofibrillar hypertrophy**.

* Increasing the amount of motor units recruited for a movement

* Increasing the efficiency of said motor units

* Inter-muscular coordination
 
But first and foremost, one must understand the concept of *Progressive Overload.*

### Progressive Overload.

Before I discuss *anything else*, I must ensure that you grasp this concept. In its simplest sense, progressive overload is simply ""doing more than you did before."" In order to gain strength, progressive overload is something that ***must*** occur. Whether it comes from increasing the weight, adding more reps, or decreasing the leverage of the movement, progressive overload is not optional. 

Take the squat, for example. If you squat 225lbs for 5x5 every workout, it's quite obvious that you aren't getting stronger. At least, it *should* be obvious. So how do you get stronger? There are two really simple ways to make progress here; you could increase the volume, or you could increase the weight. Doing either one of these will put your muscles and nervous system under stress, causing them to adapt to said stress by getting stronger. This is the key concept of strength training, forcing small adaptations that over time amount to a very large adaptation. Hypothetically, if you were to add 5-10 pounds to your squat every workout, you could go from 225lbsx5 to 315lbsx5 in a matter of months. 

### Myofibrillar Hypertrophy

It's a simple concept, once you learn about it. If a muscle is stressed at a high level, the body responds by making that muscle stronger, in case it should ever have to perform such a task again. One of the many ways to do this is to increase the number of myofibrils. Myofibrils are basic units of a muscle that make your muscles move. When they receive stimuli from the brain, they contract. To explain how this relates to strength;

More actin and myosin (the contractile proteins in myofibrils) = more muscular contraction =  MOAR STRENGTH

However, hypertrophy of any kind will not occur if one does not eat an adequate amount of calories. Simply put, you cannot make more muscle with out the proper building materials. If hypertrophy is the goal, ideally one should get at least 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, and the same amount of carbs (if not more), and consume more calories than your TDEE (see the [/r/fitness FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/wiki/faq)). 

*it's the actin and myosin proteins that increase in number, not the myofibrils themselves. Sorry, I originally did this at 3:00 in the morning on little sleep.

### Increasing Recruited Motor Units

Motor units are a combination of a motor neuron and all the fibers activated by that neuron.  There are multiple types of motor units, but for strength training, we want to focus on High Threshold Motor Units (HTMUs).  HTMUs are basically what you sometimes hear referred to as *fast twitch muscle fibers*(type IIa and IIb). These are the motor units you use when you pick up something heavy.  They also happen to have the greatest capacity for strength (and hypertrophy), which is why we focus on them. Since they are primarily used when lifting heavy things, naturally, we want to train them by doing movements that require a lot of force (read: HARD).  This is why the upper rep limits for strength training tend to be 8-12 reps(fore begginers, 5-8 for everyone else). If you can do more than 8-12 reps of an exercise, than the exercise is too easy, and you are not effectively getting stronger. In addition to this, the movement should not intentionally be slowed down. I'm aware that CC instructs you to do reps at an intentionally slow pace, this is not the way to train HTMUs. The increase in the recruitment of motor units is exactly what it sounds like, the body increases how many HTMUs are used during the movement, effectively increasing the total amount of force that can be produced.  Once all of the motor units are being recruited, the body will begin to further increase strength by improving *rate coding*, telling the muscles to contract faster. 

Another factor involved in this is the inhibition of Golgi tendon organs. These are located at both the origin and insertion of the muscle, and one of the Golgi tendon organ's jobs is to limit the amount of force a muscle can produce. Strength training tends to reduce the effect of the Golgi tendon organs, allowing more recruitment of muscle fibers. According to OG, this effect is maximized when training with 85-90% 1RM. 

### Increase in Motor unit efficiency

I'm just going to take the lazy way out and quote [OG](http://shop.eatmoveimprove.com/) on this one.  ""In untrained individuals, the motor units fire randomly to recruit the forces necessary. As we further train a movement the motor cortex is able to synchronize the firing of the motor units."" - Steven Low, [**Overcoming Gravity**](http://shop.eatmoveimprove.com/), page 13.

Basically, **one big contraction > a bunch of smaller contractions**.

How do we train for this?  Do the movement often. The more familiar a movement pattern is, the more efficient you will become at said movement.  Grease the groove is especially good for training this.

### Inter-muscular Coordination

I think the term ""inter-muscular coordination"" is pretty self-explanatory.  Simply put, it's the ability to coordinate all the muscles used in a movement in the most efficient way possible.  I'll use dips as an example: in a dip, the primary muscles used are triceps brachii, pectoralis major and minor, and the anterior and lateral deltoid head. If all of those muscles were to fire randomly, you would have a pretty hard time doing a dip. Since the body likes to do things in the most efficient way possible, eventually it will learn to fire the muscles in sync to make the movement easier.  This results in an increase in strength on that specific movement. This is generally only useful for beginners, or when learning a completely new movement. As with motor unit efficiency, this is best trained by doing the movement often. Grease the groove works great on this as well.


To sum all of this up, if strength is your goal, then your workout should meet the following criteria:

* The movements you do should be **hard**.  You should not be able to complete more than 8-12 reps per set.

* Try to increase the total work you do every workout. Whether it be doing one more rep or adding more weight.

* Once you *can* do 8-12 reps in one set, its time to pick a harder progression of the movement (e.g. push-ups --> diamond push-ups) or add more weight.

In addition to this, you must get at least .7g of protein per pound of bodyweight to ensure proper muscle recovery, and you must get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.

One thing that I forgot to mention was rest time between sets.  For strength, you may rest as long as you need, usually 3-4 minutes, sometimes even longer.  If you would like some hypertrophy as well, keep the rest times at 1-2 minutes.

Feel free to comment with any questions.

Random Comments:

*This is true muscle memory!

*This is good news for people who get injured and have to take some time off.

*This is bad news for sports, as athletes who take performance enhancing drugs may still have an advantage even after they stop taking the drugs.

*Did you know that genes can modify after conception based on the experiences of the organism? The field is called epigenetics. The most common example is that excessive stress can actually change how DNA expresses itself in mouse brains (and presumably humans too.)"

I quit sugar 2 weeks ago; These are my experiences and the effect it's had on my training.,ProgOx,695,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5qmfbk/i_quit_sugar_2_weeks_ago_these_are_my_experiences/,1485587006.0,"So, we all know sugar's not good for us, but we rarely do anything about it. I finally decided to take the plunge and see what effects it had on me.

First off, this is a part of my ""oh shit I need to drop some fat"" realisation diet. So To be clear I what I am doing is...

- I am in a 500 calorie deficit at 1800 calories.
- I have quit alcohol
- I am not eating things like bread or pasta
- I am not eating ANYTHING sweet (this includes fruit)
- I am not eating anything with sugar in that doesn't come with it naturally.
- RR three times a week
- 20 minute run, 2-3 times a week

Everyone says that for the first week of quitting sugar you will feel horrible, and with me quitting sugar and having a calorific deficit I thought I was going to have the worst week of my life. For the first three days, I was indeed lacking in energy and felt pretty tired, but I didn't by any means feel awful. After those three days I felt amazing; I had tonnes of energy, I fell asleep instantly when I went to bed and woke up feeling energetic, clear and alert. Brilliant, it seemed to be working.

Not only do I wake up feeling great, but this greatness lasts all throughout the day with barely any dips. Before I quit sugar I would usually take a nap in the middle of the day and after I ate my first meal at 12 I would be incredibly tired. Now, although I do have a dip in energy after I've eaten, it's not by much and I still feel like I can power through the things I have to do.

And then I went to the gym to get a work out in... Wow. The extra energy made me feel much stronger on all my exercises and to make things even better my pull ups, dips, tucked front levers and tucked planche which had seriously been plateauing, suddenly went on the rise again. This is despite the fact that I'm in a calorific deficit.

Now at this point I had lost 1.4 kilos, so you might say it was down to that, but I really don't think so. I was doing the same number of reps when I was 5kg lighter and I've never really found that fluctuating around +-2kg makes much of a different to my performance.

Also within the first 4 days of starting this, I lost 4cm around my waist. Now this is clearly not fat; it is most likely water weight and bloating. Normally when I start a cut I do loose water weight, but I've never gone down 4cm that quickly. I'm going to blame the majority of that 4cm on sugar, and the fact that it might do that to you, does not seem good to me.

It can be a pain sometimes though. When I get home after a long day and couldn't be bothered to cook once, I decided to go down to the shop and buy some pre-roasted chicken breast. Upon arriving at the shop and looking at all their pre-cooked chicken I found out that they all had sugar added to them. There is virtually no pre-cooked food that you can eat if you are cutting out all added sugar. Now, I've upped my meal-prep game.

2 weeks in and I feel better than ever. I wake up every morning at 04:30 with no issues and often wake up before my alarm. I'm feeling strong when doing the RR and am making progress again. Is this all in my mind? Is it all a placebo? Well, maybe. But at least for now I'm getting some amazing results out of it. 

Has anyone else had experience with a no-sugar diet?"

Edit: for more information, I currently weigh around 70 kg. I did RR as described in the FAQ, and started with 3x5 negatives (since I could hold a dead hang for 30+ seconds pretty easily). Then once I could do 3x8 negatives (each one like 4-5 seconds long), I noticed I could pull myself halfway up pretty easily, but was struggling to do the latter half of the chin-up. So I started adding static holds at the top with my chin above the bar, and so my routine would be something like 3x5 negatives with a 3 second hold at the top."

For this month, we are going to master the crow pose!**

* [The crow pose looks like this.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hml31hm-Zkg/hqdefault.jpg)
* It's aka the ""frog stand"" in gymnastics and ""bakasana"" in sanskrit (which translates to crow-pose).
* I've written extensively about it [here](http://antranik.org/learning-and-mastering-the-crow-pose/) and [GMB](http://gmb.io/crow-pose/) has as well.

###If you can't hold the crow pose, not to worry! You will before the end of this month!

[My follow along video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hml31hm-Zkg) has helped countless people achieve it. All you need to do is elevate your feet by a few inches on something and master these progressions:

1. Tippy-toe supported crow pose (on a block)
2. One foot, tippy-toe supported crow pose (on a block)
3. Crow Pose (from a block)
4. Crow Pose (feet on ground)

###If you could hold the crow pose for over 20 seconds, try it with straight arms and it becomes ""crane pose"" (aka advanced frog stand)!

---

* **ProTip:** If you follow our [Recommended Routine,](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) throw this in there and practice it as part of your Skill Work.

* **ProTip #2:** If your wrists hurt, warm them up with [this first.](https://youtu.be/8lDC4Ri9zAQ?t=7m25s)

##Time for you to check in!

###Get on the floor, set a timer and test a crow pose progression exercise, the crow pose itself or the crane pose (whatever is appropriate for you) and tell us how you did! 

* Which progression are you at and how many seconds were you able to perform it?
* Optional: Post a photo or video of you performing it! 
* Optional: Gender, Age, Height, Weight [kg/lbs please]

###Questions? Feel free to ask!

Next week, I'll post a follow up check-in thread so we'll see how we're progressing. I'll also throw in more variants and cool transitions that can build up on the basic crow pose for us to practice.  But the main thing you should do is get some crow pose practice in at *least* 3x this week.

Do you have rounded shoulder + nerd neck? Me too!,MovementTom,692,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/70u1x3/do_you_have_rounded_shoulder_nerd_neck_me_too/,1505729563.0,"Hey BWF peeps,

I try not to just promote videos on here but I think many might find this useful. I know many people here are interested in their bodies beyond the point of just doing crazy bodyweight moves, probably more so than other fitness spaces. Posture, however, is sometimes a little forgotten and with the good mobility and structural integrity requirement of bodyweight training, it's pretty important.

The nature of bodyweight training involves a lot of focus on pushing and the hollow body. This combined with general modern day life sat at a computer can make things like rounded shoulders and nerd neck worse.

I personally have been aware of my issue with posture but haven't really committed to doing much about it so I made a video to not only help others fix their posture but also as accountability to fix my own.

If you have rounded shoulders or nerd neck and aren't happy with it then maybe join me in fixing it. The video has a full stretching and strengthing routine to use and it would be cool to get more people involved.

If you don't want to watch the video, [the full routine is posted to Imgur here](https://imgur.com/a/xyf9X). Otherwise, you can [watch the video here](https://youtu.be/sXLRVXFBxzM).

As always, I'll be lurking on this subreddit so let me know your thoughts and if you're going to join!

Tom aka The Bodyweight Warrior :)

EDIT: It would be cool to make this into a 30 day challenge (not that I think 30 days is enough to correct potentially years of bad posture but doing something is better than nothing), any suggestions on how to do this?"
"After 2 years off ever since covid closures started, I'm so weak now, and trying to get back into shape. Has this happened to other folks the past couple years, and were you able to get your strength back to where you were before?",frogdujour,694,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/uat107/after_2_years_off_ever_since_covid_closures/,1650800774.0,"I had been doing regular body weight workouts for probably 20 years, mostly high bar and rings, plus very regular rock climbing.  When covid closures hit, my gym closed for months, and I found no alternate venue or equipment, and in particular had nothing to hang on, and then just got lazy. A year later I moved (and there is no climbing gym anywhere), and continued being lazy and fully lost any workout routine and got weak, though my weight stayed similar, maybe +5lbs. For the record, 42M, about 190lbs. 

Compared to where I was 2-3 years ago, I feel downright scary weak.  A couple months ago, I tried doing pull ups again for the first time, and couldn't even do one.  I tried pushups, and got 12.  When hanging on a bar, I could barely lift my knees up to elbow height and for only half a second, and could hardly even lift my legs into a hanging L-sit.  I tried ring dips and could struggle to get 2-3. I managed 1 pistol squat, painfully. 

Pre-covid for comparison, I was at a consistent 15 pull ups, 8-10 L-sit or V-sit pull ups, 50-70 pushups, could easily do multiple bar pullovers in a row, a few upside down rows, windshield wipers, about 15 ring dips or 10-12 L-sit ring dips, maybe 10-15 pistol squats.

I've started working out again now 2-3 times a week the past few weeks, and I'm slooowly seeing progress, but I have a massively long way to go.  I now got back up to 4 pull ups, 25 pushups, can hold maybe 10-15 seconds of L-sit, and can at least touch my toes up to the bar one time, bent-kneed, for a couple seconds.  Basically it still feels like gravity has tripled compared to how for years before I could simply do all the exercises without even thinking about it.  

Have any of you had any similar experience falling off the workout wagon during covid and getting back on?  How has your progress gone?"
I made a guide outlining how to give yourself a full body mobility assessment!,Captain_Nachos,690,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4sp8yo/i_made_a_guide_outlining_how_to_give_yourself_a/,1468441129.0,"Hey guys! Nick E here!

Following some demand from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/4rskz0/is_there_a_list_of_exercises_to_test_mobility_so/d543zvq
I decided to start up on a project for making a guide that makes it so anyone could easily spend 20 minutes and get a good idea of where their mobility is lacking, or if they have any imbalances.

#LINK HERE: http://www.nick-e.com/mobility-assessment/

##Summary:##

Not going to list all the tests and assessments on here as they are better explained in the article with pictures and whatnot, but here's a list of all the articulations tested:

* Shoulder Flexion

* Shoulder Extension

* External Shoulder Rotation

* Internal Shoulder Rotation 

* Wrist Flexion/Extension

* Finger Flexion/Extension

* Internal Hip Rotation

* External Hip Rotation

* Hip Abduction

* Hip Extension

* Straight Leg Hip Flexion (Pike)

* Bent Leg Hip Flexion (Squat)

* Ankle Dorsiflexion

For each articulation I propose a test, explain the pass/fail, and propose possible causes of the failure, in terms of particular muscles being tight or weak.

**OTHER STUFF**

This is just kinda step 1 of this project. I wanted to get this out cos this was just the most explicitly demanded aspect. In future I'm going to add a section that directs you to resources that directly address each of the issues listed, so once you identify a problem, you can immediately go about formulating a solution to it! After that I'm going to make a youtube video for each accompanying articulation/assessment to go along with the article, as in the original suggestion, some people did want a video, but its such a big topic I've realised one video just isn't gonna cut it!

What do you guys think of the assessment? Does anyone have any suggestions  to alter it to improve it? Did I miss anything important that should be assessed?

**EDIT 1:** Lots of people are asking to be notified or to post again once I've updated everything. The videos and 'how to fix' section will be coming quite step by step. If you want to wait for the full update post, be warned, it will take a while! If you want to see the updates as they come, just check out my channel , cos I won't be putting them all into the article til' they are all finished! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5ygTs_puiGKvyw47UCBVA

This is no advice asking post. Just a general ""Writing off the ""frustration"""".

I started doing the Recommended routine 3 months ago. I was making great progress. I started out not being able to do a single push\-up and evolved into starting the diamond push\-ups, handstand against the wall with frequent foot lifts,...

Then a two weeks ago I woke up in the morning wrecked with pain in my muscles and a fever. After a week of struggling with my situation the doctor diagnosed me with polymiositis, a rare Auto\-immune disease that inflames your muscles and starts to break em down. I lost strength in my hands, upper body and legs. After an intensive therapy I am now recovering and my strength has somewhat returned though the endurance is stall absent. I can lift heavy things but I can't hold them up for more then 5 seconds.

It's a bit frustrating that I lost all my progress. But I wouldn't be a bodyweightfitness man if I let one setback tank my motivation completely.

Time to put on my tough\-man cap and regain my losses. It will be a struggle but as a former ""fatguy"" in bodyweightfitness what isn't?

Sorry if this is  against the rules but I needed a place to write it down."

The last few months, I worked on my excel workout plan. I put a whole lot of time in it because I'm kind of perfectionist personality. There are 3 different workout days in it. So, the whole thing is a 4-week mesocycle. Delete and modulate what you want to. Maybe you should have some excel skills.  
Push, pull, legs, core exercises got their own color. Fill in set- and rep-counts on the right of the exercise. On the bottom you will find a small Max.reps List.

On the very right side you will find:   
*- Weekly total of Sets per Movement (This is maybe the most important one)*  
*- Weekly total reps of every movement*  
*- Weekly average values from your Handstand sessions. (My favorite so far :) )*  
*- And the totals from the different Mesocycles (There are 2 register on the lower edge of the excel window. You can easy copy these plans, but don't forget to connect and correct the excel formulas!)*

You can change every exercise you want. I'm doing a SA/BA split so I've got a few static holds. Just track your seconds instead of reps.

Maybe it's a little bit complex but try it out if you also a person who want to track everything and check the progress in a very precisely way. I can't be the only one. Maybe there are already good plans out like mine. I didn't check that out.

'ello BWF peoples,

We all know the importance of mobility. It's so ingrained in the type of training performed as a bodyweight athlete (warrior) that without a decent range of motion it can really limit progression and performance.

This is why I created a generic full body mobility routine so everybody can jump in with a solid start and begin to improve their mobility. 

The routine takes roughly 25-30 minutes to perform and covers a wide range of movements. I recommend performing the routine daily but results should come from a frequency of 3-4x a week.

It can be performed as it's own individual session, as an extended warm up for your workout or throughout the day in 5 minute chunks. There is no real optimal way, it's that it gets done that is important.

Be sure to **[check out the video](https://youtu.be/QT4hvcIjKtc)** and **download the cheat sheet** for the routine.

What do you guys think?

Have a strong week,

Tom :)

How to exercise during periods when you can't get enough sleep?,stetslustig,693,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nz5nrd/how_to_exercise_during_periods_when_you_cant_get/,1623617441.0,"So I (38M) have a week old baby, which as an understatement, interferes with my sleep. My guess is I'm averaging 4-5 hours of interrupted sleep, rather than my usual 8-9 hours of solid sleep. Hopefully this will improve as time goes on, but if my last child is any indication, it may be a while.

I know proper sleep and rest is needed for optimal muscle growth, etc, but all the advice I read just says to get more sleep, nothing on what to do if I can't. I'm a beginner, been doing the RR about 3 months. Should I just keep at it? Do it less frequently? Scale back the intensity? I am not expecting to progress much, but I would like to not backslide much.

ETA: I just read through all the comments, and I'm pretty sure for every single comment there is another comment giving the exact opposite advice. At least now I know there's no agreed upon answer the the question.... Regardless, lots of good wisdom in there, thanks everyone!"
"Review of Athlean-X 'Perfect' Home Workout Routine, and a comment on Coronavirus Opportunism",Captain_Nachos,692,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/flce7e/review_of_athleanx_perfect_home_workout_routine/,1584633612.0,"Hey everyone it's Nick-E.

# Do we really need another ""CORONAVIRUS HOME LOCK DOWN APOCALYPSE QUARANTINE WORKOUT SAMPLE PROGRAM #27835 LINK IN BIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" at this point?

There has been a real surge of traffic to the sub recently due to gym closures on account of the globally developing situation regarding the novel coronavirus, so interest in home workouts has understandably increased.

With that has come an onslaught of online fitness content creators racing to come out with a quickly slapped together video, pdf or article, some even tactlessly branding them as 'PANDEMIC/QUARANTINE/LOCKDOWN/ETC. WORKOUT TO KEEP UR GAINZ WHILE THE WORLD LITERALLY CRUMBLES AROUND YOU' to seemingly take advantage of the frenzy of the situation and gain some followers.

(Disclaimer: I'm not claiming everyone who posts home workout guides at the moment are being opportunistic or exploitative of the current pandemic, just many that I've seen are. I'm aware many people are simply sharing information in solidarity to try to support others in this difficult situation we're all in)

Despite my own personal gripes with how some of these routines are presented, at very least they are improving the incentive for people to stay home and not contribute to the spread of the virus out in public gyms. That's a good thing because no one should be putting their gains ahead of the interests of the public good when the lives of many at-risk people are at stake.

However, we've seen a very high volume of these routines posted on the subreddit, and an overwhelming majority of these routines are not presenting unique or helpful advice, and an unfortunate number of them seem to be even ignoring basic principles of training theory.

Ultimately, a quick slapdash program that was thought up by someone in 20 minutes before rushing out a youtube video on it to be given out for free is not some magical product that will be in any way superior to the existing home workout resources that are in the sidebar that have been continually refined over time. Not to say our sidebar is a perfect and infallible resource, it is definitely due for some updates, re-hauls and refinements, but by and large most of what you need to know can be learned from taking some time to sit down and read.

# A review of Athlean-X's Coronavirus Workout

One example of this is Athlean-X's particular flavour of coronavirus home workouts. I would love to cover all the different programs that have come out in the last few days but a lot of them share the same problems, and it would be an enourmous time investment for little benefit if i went over all of them. So because Athlean-X's program has been posted probably the most, (seriously this has been posted SO many times.) I figured I could give a direct response to the quality of its content, while also describing some general problems with a lot of these programs I've seen.

I'm not going to post a link to the video, you can find it yourself if you want, but i will explain it in detail here as I review the content.

So let's get started.

Before we get into his program, I think it would be useful to have a basic yardstick to measure what a quality home workout would look like. This is not an infallible or exhaustive criteria, but its a start for the minimum you would hope from a program:

* Follows basic principles of strength training:
   * Has scope for progressive overload (for bodyweight training, that means a comprehensive list of progressions appropriate for any strength or skill level)
   * Exercise intensity, rest time and volume is appropriate for the intended purpose of the exercise or routine
* Adequately exercises all the major muscle groups in a, not necessarily perfectly, but sufficiently balanced way for medium to long term training

Doesn't sound like much to ask for, but lets see how well the program fits.

# Program Structure:

It is a 3x per week program, with a Workout A/Workout B structure, it is proposed to be 'full body'.

It is based around 6 types of exercise, which at surface level suggest an adequately balanced approach to training full body if its executed properly:

1. Anterior Chain Lower Body (or more simply, a Squatting pattern)
2. Upper Body Push
3. Posterior Chain Lower Body (or more simply, a hip hinge pattern)
4. Upper Body Pull
5. Abs
6. ""Corrective Exercise

All sections apart from the ""corrective"" will have 3 exercises in them, which are meant to be performed one after the other with 0 rest. Each combination of 3 exercises should be performed continuously for 60 seconds. Additionally, there is no rest between sections. That means you will be exercising continuously for 6 minutes, then you're done to spend your other precious 15 hours and 54 minutes of waking time stuck in your house combing your carpet all in the same direction or counting how many grains of rice there are in the jar in your kitchen.

**EDIT: Someone in the comments pointed out an ambiguity in his language that I misinterpreted, proposing: "" At 2:42 in the the video, he says that the program require no rest between each exercise in each combo. All exercises will be performed individually for 1 minute. So your spend 3 minutes on each section of your body, rather than 1. ""**

**This means the workout would be 16 minutes in total for one full round (3 per 5 body areas, 1 for corrective exercise)**

**/END EDIT**

Based on the order of the exercises your upper body will get a minute of rest while your lower body works, and vice versa, so while it is not the worst thing in the world, its entirely unnecessary and your weak link/stopping point will almost absolutely be something other than the strength of your muscles, like muscle acidity causing you to prematurely fatigue, needing to catch your breath (depending how fast you go), or the fatigue of accessory muscles that are involved in all the exercises like the many muscles in the nebulously named 'core'. Which, unlike specific action muscles like the biceps, don't get much rest if at all for these 6 minutes.

There is a reason that every strength program in existence has schemes like '3 sets of 10 with 90 seconds of rest', instead of 'do 30 reps of this exercise'.

Specific measured numbers of reps per set allow for measured, objective progress from workout to workout or week to week.

Total reps are broken up into sets because that allows you to accumulate more volume training at a higher intensity than you could do all at once, which ultimately means better gains. Your body response to adapt to stimuli. To put it simply, If you make it do a really hard thing, it will try to get stronger to better do that hard thing so it becomes easy. If you make it to an easy thing for 6 straight minutes without stopping, it will become better at continuously working for 6 minutes, but it won't necessarily make your muscles bigger or stronger, just better endurance and fuel efficiency.

So the verdict on this ""1 min continuous per combo, no rest between combos"" scheme is a big thumbs down for appreciable strength building or gaining muscle.

# Exercise Selection:

So this is a significant problem area. This program, in keeping with a lot of Athlean-X's content, takes the concept of 'keep it simple, stupid' and chucks it out the window. The number of variations of exercises in this program is simply way, way too high for no good reason and seem only to be present to make the program look flashy and keep it interesting, at the sacrifice of actual effectiveness.

Not to mention, most of the exercises are actually not even very good, either in general, or for the purpose he has purported in the video.

Let's break them down piece by piece.

SQUAT:

* Single Leg Box Squats
   * These are totally fine as an exercise, and as a progression for pistols. Can be easily loaded for progressive overload with a backpack full of books or water bottles, or by adjusting depth. Thumbs up.
* 1 + 1/2 bottom half squats
   * There's nothing wrong with these but personally they fit into the camp that a lot of the exercises in this routine fall into, which is ""variation for the sake of it"", without any real benefit. It just gives creedence to the program because it seems like he's handpicked the OPTIMAL exercise for OPTIMAL MAXIMUM GAINS. Really it's just a flashy distraction.
* Jump Squats
   * Same as above.
* Alt. Crossover Step Ups
   * These are good. Also easy to progress with depth or with some kind of easy to find household weight. Make sure to only gently tap the floor with the back foot and not use the back calf to help cheat.
* Alt. Reverse Lunges
   * These are good as perhaps a lower body accessory movement to be done for higher reps. Limited capacity for progression but useful for higher volume work to a limited degree.
* Split Squat Jumps
   * ""Variation for the sake of it"". Can be done for fun but not something you'd put in a ""PERFECT WORKOUT"" by any means. His demonstration in the video looks dreadful as well. Imo there's no reason to do these other than to get sweaty.

HINGE:

* Alt Single Leg Heel Touch/Kickstand Variation
   * This is simply not a hinge movement. Not to mention that most people without good conscious control of the function of their glute med as a stabiliser will absolutely butcher any semblence of posterior chain activation these might afford.
   * It would be much better to simply learn to hinge and follow the single leg RDL progression pathway. Here is a guide on the hinge for people to use:  [https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/bodyweight-hinge/](https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/bodyweight-hinge/)
* Alt. Sprinter Lunges
   * These are not really a posterior chain exercise just because you lean forward. Between these and the ones above, these are still really very quadricep dominant, but maybe have a little bit more psoterior chain action than a simple squat. But barely. Maybe. I'd give them a thumbs down.
* Plyo Sprinter Lunges (jump from higher position if more beginner)
   * Same as above.
* Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Single Leg) OR Slick Floor Bridge Curl (Dual Leg)
   * These are awesome and I love them. Really very effective, difficult exercise that can be adjusted or overloaded with tempo eccentrics, single vs double leg, holding weight on your hips, etc. Definitely one of the best lower body posterior chain strengtheners in bodyweight, and something we will probably be looking to add to the RR.
   * Favourite aspect of these is that they work the glutes and hamstrings together, but also work the distal and proximal aspects of the hamstrings together too (Hip extension + knee flexion)
* Long Leg March
   * Good hammy accessory, can also be overloaded with time or weight. Thumbs up.
* High Hip Bucks
   * A fine variation to a normal glute bridge. I would have thought a normal and then single leg glute bridge on the floor would be better general use before moving onto a foot elevated variation, but these aren't necessarily ""bad"", just not optimal imo.

UPPER PUSH:

* Handstand Pushups
   * Bad form in the demonstration but as an exercise itself, great for those who can do it. The problem here falls into the regression:
* ""Power Pushaways""
   * These are hot garbage. You can't mimic a vertical pushing movement in a horizontal plane and expect it to have the same impact. A better variation here would be a pike pushup to an elevated pike pushup to a handstand pushup as is the normal progression.
   * Here is the pike pushup as properly executed:  [https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/pikepu/](https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/pikepu/)
   * Most people will not be advised to try these unless they already have strong, solid full decline pushups with good form.
* ""Rotational"" Pushups/Knee Variation
   * USELESS VARIATION FOR THE SAKE OF FLASHY COOLNESS STRIKES AGAIN! You will not be getting any meaningful improvements in your chest gains from doing this, you'll just look like a dweeb and it will limit your ability to progressively overload by putting things on your back. Pushups good. 'Rotational' chest 'gains' bad.
   * What's more important is people getting good quality basic pushup form down. Have a look here for that if you're interested:  [https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/pushup/](https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/pushup/)
* Cobra Pushups
   * These aren't ultimately doing much for you other than adding more pushup volume, they're fun, and have a bit of a BW floor tricep extension aspect to them. I don't hate these but its hard to take seriously in such a cancerously titled 'perfect' workout.
* Variable Wall Pushups OR Knee Decline Pushups
   * According to him these don't work the shoulders but really focus in on the chest. That's just demonstrably wrong. Decline pushups will work the shoulders more for sure, and his doing them against a wall does not encourage good pushup form. Better to elevate the feet on a box or chair as he has demonstrated you must have available for this routine anyway.
* Knee Flat Pushups
   * Not terrible if you do them well, but not progressively overloadable, and isnt specific to proper pushup form. Better to do incline pushups and progress to floor (like we say to do already.) This goes for all knee pushup variations in this whole program.
* Alt. BW Side Lateral Raises (from knees for beginners)
   * Cool Exercise, I don't hate it. Probably won't have any direct impact on the lateral delts to an appreciable degree but its a good variation on the static front and side plank on elbows.
* Tricep BW Extensions (long head stretch)
   * Great exercise. Can be progressively overloaded with angle/height of surface, and ROM. Great tricep pump. Be careful with your elbows and don't go too hard too soon.

UPPER PULL:

* Pullups OR Seated Pullups
   * Pullups are great. The bread and butter of calisthenics. Seated ones? If done as a jacknife pullup with legs elevated on something they could be useful but as he demonstrates them its not so awesome. Negatives and top holds are best if you can't do pullups but can do rows.
* Human Pullovers
   * This is a fuckin dragon flag. He needs to stop making up names. This is ultimately a core exercise even if it challenges the lats, and he has offered no options for progression for individuals who cannot do this. Bad for a 'perfect' workout.
* BW Sliding Pulldowns
   * These seem like a bit of a joke but Ive never actually tried them. As of now I refuse to comment on them because I've literally never seen them before but they seem like they'd be hard to progressively overload effectively.
* Inverted Chin Curls
   * Seems like a good bwf alternative to bicep curls. Never tried them.
* Chin Ups OR Seated Chin Ups
   * Chinups are great but theres no reason to do both pullups and chinups. Usually picking one you like is fine. Also doing both is fine. No problem.
* Inverted Rows
   * Ok THIS. Is the most important exercise in my opinion. However, his demonstration of it is probably one of the worst I've ever seen and is done in a way that almost nullifies it as a distinct exercise from those 'seated' pullups hes touting. That fact that this and his back widows are his only mid back focused exercises in this program besides having 1000 lat exercises is a problem for a guy whose whole brand is 'exercise perfectly or your body will crumble into dust, please pay me money'. When people talk about push/pull balance for shoulder health, they don't mean your lats. They mean your actual back muscles between your scaps, your rhomboids, your mid and low traps. they're the ones that are meaningfully balancing out your pecs and shoulders. Your lats are internal rotators of the shoulder. They will not be balancing out internal rotation moments from excessive pec tension. They will be contributing to it.
   * Onto the fact that his demonstration is god awful: This is a link to a comprehensive guide on inverted rows, that should help you learn how to execute them properly : [https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/row/](https://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/row/)
* Back Widows
   * I personally think these are cool as a mid back acessory. You can also do them in the corner of the room where walls meet at an incline for more full ROM and to make them a little easier. I've worked these before and might film a quick demonstration of what I mean if people are interested and I'll just edit it into the post (p.s. not a 'HEY WHATS UP GUYZ' video, just a 10 second demonstration shared on Google Photos)

CORE:

* Reverse Corkscrews
* Knee Slides
* Levitation Crunches
* Ab Halos
* V-Up Tucks
* Sit-Up
* Elbow Thrusts

When it comes to core, these are all fine high rep Rectus Abdominis strengtheners. Maybe even a little bit of exernal oblique work too. However, I would personally say outside of burnout core workouts, working on things like:

* L-sits
* Dead Bugs (These are king and absolutely key imo. No other exercise done properly can strengthen and coordinate your internal obliques and transverse abdominis like these. They just have a bit of a learning curve. Check em out here:  [https://www.nick-e.com/deadbug/](https://www.nick-e.com/deadbug/) They can be progressed with the variations in the guide, and also infinitely with ankle weights and weights in the hands. These have infinite bang for buck and if you could only pick one ab movement, I'd say this is it.)
* Planks
* Rollouts (If you have an ab wheel)

are your real bread and butter for BWF core training.

'CORRECTIVE' EXERCISE:

* Angels and Devils
   * GREAT EXERCISE for individuals who are already a great deal of time and work down the path of developing good mind/muscle connection with their lower and mid traps, serratus anterior, and rotator cuff, but as corrective exercises for scapulohumeral rhythm/overhead mobility/rotator cuff strength goes, this is a very advanced variation that I would not in my life recommend in as poor detail as he has, without any options for regressions or even talking very much about its purpose to the client. At worst, this is a very shitty anterior delt pump exercise with a useless behind the back arms motion. And that will be how it comes out in a majority of cases if people just try to mimic him from the screen.
   * Better time spent here working on simplified variations such as wall angels, trap 3 raises, and other beginner activation/corrective/prehab/rehab drills for the same function.
* Reverse Hypers
   * This is not a corrective exercise. I don't know what he's proposing it is 'correcting' in terms of movements patterns. This is just a lower back strengthening exercise. It's a good one at that, and sort of one of the only ones available in BWF.

# Conclusion:

One of my senior coaches and mentors when I worked as in intern in competitive sport S&C for a year used to regularly say ""Any idiot can make another idiot tired"". A lot of people are commenting on this routine about how it is fun and it really kicks their ass. That doesn't mean it's good. This is the same reason that there is such an abundnce of poor quality CrossFit gyms and 'Bootcamp' Fitness classes that are very commercially successful in spite of their god awful training quality. In my opinion, this 'perfect' workout fits 'perfectly' into that category. It's nothing more than a fun sweat churner.

Will this workout be fun if you try it? Yes. If you like circuit torture.

Will you get really sick gains from it? Probably not.

Will you be able to run it long term? Or even medium term? Not if you want actual results.

Am I just a big ol' athlean X hater who is jelly of his fame and super lean body? Yes. Disregard everything I've said in this post. haha jk... unless....

**What should you do instead?**

\- Recognise you won't make the same gains with limited equipment as you may have in a gym setting, but there's still a wide scope for a lot of people to continue to progress, or learn new skills if you get creative with quality execises that have a wide scope for progressive overload

\- Read the FAQ/Wiki here and learn a little bit more about how bodyweight training works more effectively. (Hint: for those of you coming from a gym background, its not magically different to weights, just has some learning curve initially with progressions)

\- Use this time to work on mobility and corrective exercises because those don't take much if any equipment and you'll set yourself up in good stead when it becomes a socially and morally responsible decision to go to the gym again.

\- Keep safe, be healthy, and take care of yourself however you can.

\------

**TL;DR - No. It's not the perfect workout.  It's not even a good workout. If you care about long term progress, educate yourself and train properly instead of being baited by the youtube master of fitness clickbait.**

It has been an incredible journey this past year and a half exercising with minimal equipment and I am still learning  things. 

A recent one I realized was to emphasize biceps more I take a broom, wrap towels on each end so the handle does not damage anything, and hold it outside of a doorway, letting the covered parts rest against the frame. Then I can lean away from it and curl myself only koving forearms, I feel way more focus on my biceps

All the variations we can do with minimal equipment has made me realize that anyone can exercise, you dont need a gym membership, just be willing to get creative. This has also changed a lot in how I prescribe exercises for my clients"

How do people get their abs to show consistently with bodyweight training?,mycockislongaf,682,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/npt7qt/how_do_people_get_their_abs_to_show_consistently/,1622551729.0,"My fat percentage is relatively low.

After that 5 minutes of grace, my abs go back to a ""ehhh its kinda visible i guess"" state. 

My workout consists of 150 sit ups and 60 leg raises split into 2 sets. Its my own routine so I don't expect it to be perfect but come on, let my abs be at least visible constantly. So I'm sitting here wondering how people have their abs out clearly all the time. What can I do to make it show consistently?

Bodyweight strength training programs in Google Sheets 2.0,TwoWorkOuts,685,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mt8ai5/bodyweight_strength_training_programs_in_google/,1618731003.0,"A while ago I shared the Google Sheets template I've been using for my own training. Since I'm using the sheets actively myself I wanted to add some additional features I could use. All the functions are still script free so you don't have to enable anything in your Drive to start using these templates. But since there are no scripts and all the functionality is based on the basic sheets functions it has its limits on what you can do. For example I could not find a way to create a stopwatch timer without using scripts. So if you are doing static holds you will have to use a separate timer app. But you can enter the hold times in seconds manually to your workout to enable the tracking feature.

Updates on 2.0 sheets:

\-Total workout time tracking added

\-Track individual exercise progress as a chart

\-Instructions on how to track static holds

\-Template for RR included as requested. I copied all the exercise progressions and links as they are in the wiki. Note that the exercise progressions are a bit different than in the other workout templates provided.

\-Included Simple 1x and 2x week routines that revolve around three core exercises squat, push-up and pullup with some optional accessory work for muscle groups that don't get any indirect work.

What I never learn from lifting weights,Most-Director5057,686,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/w0ezjw/what_i_never_learn_from_lifting_weights/,1657972605.0,"https://imgur.com/a/1VydOCD

This picture is 18 months progress from when I first picked up a weight with the worst form possible,  to where I was able make a few gains and learn slightly better techniques. Towards the 12 month mark of my training, I began to plateau and no longer saw much in the way of results. I started to find that I no longer enjoyed the same old routine of throwing around weights. This led me to start exploring what else I could try. After watching a video of someone’s tuck planche progression, I fell down the rabbit hole of watching YouTube videos on calisthenics! I was hooked! I loved the idea of using minimalistic equipment and focussing on strength through body weight!
I spent the next couple weeks lurking on groups such as this, reading as much as I could to learn about what calisthenics and body weight fitness entailed. 
I am now week 2 doing the RR. It has been a super humbling experience. I could barely make it through my first workout and couldn’t even remember the last time I felt the level of muscle soreness like I did the following recovery day. Even in such early stages of trying purely body weight exercises I have started to learn how important it is to begin with the basics such as push-ups, pull-ups and proper core work. I am so far from having proper form and mind-muscle connection, but after two weeks of RR I am already starting to understand why it is so important to have good foundations. And thus begins my calisthenics journey! Thank you for all the sick advice and experiences that ya’ll share here!"
The importance of MASTERING THE BASICS & a challenge for beginners,gregoryscottfit,685,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6dxrhv/the_importance_of_mastering_the_basics_a/,1496025437.0,"What's going on amazing people of bwf! I hope everybodys having a gainful day. So as somebody that's been training and doing the calisthenics/fitness thing for awhile I've had a chance to really see what helps people and what people struggle with.

One of the biggest struggles and something that hinders people is expecting results too fast, trying to train something you're not ready for, and just not knowing what to expect and when to progress. Can anybody relate ? Frustrated with their progress?

When it comes to advancing in calisthenics and really anything in life, you have to MASTER the basics and lay a solid foundation before

I give this example. If you wanted to play the piano would you start out playing Mozart or would you start out playing twinkle twinkle little star ? Twinkle twinkle little star might sound basic but its what you need.

If you want to get good at basketball do you try to dunk right away or do you practice your handles first.

It's the same thing for calisthenics. We have to master the basics before we progress to anything else. We have to master the basics before we can train at a crazy high intensity and see our body change rapidly.

The basics include pushups, pullups, dips, and squats When im training a new client or im giving somebody advice i always tell them that they need to have a goal in mind. This will give your training purpose instead of it being random

Based off of my own experience a great milestone to set for yourself and a point where you're ready to start advancing is this

* 20-30 solid pushups
* 8-12 solid pullups
* 15-25 bodyweight dips 
* Bodyweight squats no problem

If you can't hit those marks yet theres a good idea of what you should be working towards.. If you can great job and continue to solidify and nail in the basics! Even though i can planche, and muscleup and handstand im always going back to the basics. When I first started calisthenics reps and sets is all I did.

Calisthenics is STRENGTH CONTROL. When you're doing a rep it should be exactly how you want to do it. Good hollow body, full range of motion, controlled breathing everything. No ugly banana backing or half reps. Strength control every rep every set. Train with a purpose !

So to recap. Before you ever think about progressing you want to make sure that you MASTER THE BASICS. You should have clean reps consistently without even having to put much though into it. Set some goals for yourself. I gave an example above but you can shoot for anything that you want. Lastly stay consistent and work hard !

Thanks for reading up to this point and let's everybody get 1% better today ! If anybody has any questions let me know !

All of this text is a summary of my latest youtube video so if you want to watch that the link is here

"Progress post - 1,5 year skill transformation",None,683,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hl4x7p/progress_post_15_year_skill_transformation/,1593875772.0,"  

Around 1,5 years I probably made some of the best changes in my life. Back In the day, I was quite a boring boy. I played a lot of video games and I needed a healthy hobby. One day I saw on youtube these insane strong calisthenics athletes, the skills like the planche and front lever were something that really impressed me. Especially planche push-ups. This is where my passion for calisthenics had started.

So I decided to go for it. I trained (almost) every day for at least 1 hour and I said to myself that I was not gonna stop till I achieved all the advanced skills of calisthenics. I became obsessed with calisthenics. Still, after 1,5 years of training, I work out every single day and I am not planning to stop.

I am proud, but still not satisfied

Things I learned and achieved in the past 1,5 years

Discipline, achieving hard skills is a long road. Consistency is key. I learned to have a better discipline because of calisthenics. This is also helpful in many other aspects of my life.

Patience and enjoying the journey, Like I said before it is a long road. It takes a lot of time if you want to achieve the skills you want. You will have to deal with failure and there will be times that you won't see any progression at all. But you gotta keep the focus and enjoy every moment of it. It is not about the destiny it is all about the journey!

Okay now the skills I achieved

I have made a youtube video of my 1,5 skill progression but here is a quick summary:

What kind of progress has been achieved by people who train consistently every single day?,None,681,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nhtip1/what_kind_of_progress_has_been_achieved_by_people/,1621606427.0,"By training daily, I don't mean a PPL split or any other kind of split routine. I mean training using a routine like the minimalist routine in the wiki. In these daily workouts, you don't exhaust your body so that you can't move the next day.

What if you find a routine and a volume that doesn't exhaust you. Then you do that daily like any other daily habit. What kind of results or progress can you expect? Can you build muscle to be generally fit and healthy in that way?

A sample routine may look like:

1. Pushup
2. Pullup
3. Dead bugs
4. Squats

The sets and reps vary according to your capability. You start out super small as a beginner and gradually build your volume over time. But whatever be the volume you never fatigue your body either mentally or physically. You do your workout and then move on with the rest of your day like any other normal day.

Has anyone trained like this? What results did you achieve? Kindly share.

&#x200B;

Edit:

1. This workout is just a sample. I can't do even a single dip now. Maybe when I can do elevated pushups, I will try and move on to dips.

2. This sub has a habit of micromanaging stuff. Like, you did horizontal push, so you should do horizontal pull, otherwise, you will hurt yourself. How true is this? Like pullups will eventually build a strong back.

3. I do not want only endurance. Of course, I want to build muscle. Muscle is what will increase my metabolism and help me sit on my ass and burn fat. Also muscle will keep all the nagging pains away from a 30 year old's body. Muscle will help me move easier.

4. Another example of such a routine is the new [BWF-primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer). It has place for progressions and is short. You can do it daily according to the progressions you choose.

5. Another fact: I eat some protein daily and also vegetables. All home cooked. Eggs, fish, etc. And I sleep 8 hrs + daily. I can't function with less. Maybe, as I exercise more my appetite will increase more. I am not a fan of measuring and micro managing my food. My hunger indicates how much I should eat. I rarely eat fast food. Maybe once in 2 months or so. So I don't fuss about what to eat. I know I am eating real foods."

A lot of people will tell you to rest when your sore but what about boot camp? Don’t they run those guys and gals crazy hard? Pushups, sit-ups, pull-ups and running all day everyday? From what I’ve seen, everyone after boot camp is shredded. I also heard that they deprive you from sleep so I guess sleeping isn’t as important as people say?

Maybe they have a super high calorie intake that allows them to train like that??

Any thoughts or comments?"

Welcome to the L-sit/V-sit Motivational Month! We will be focusing this month on improving our L/V-sits anyway which way we can! Look inside for the details and check in NOW!,Antranik,682,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8g9twd/welcome_to_the_lsitvsit_motivational_month_we/,1525192635.0,"It's time to party with the CLASSIC bodyweight exercise that requires nothing but a floor so your excuses for not participating are NIL: [THE FLOOR L-SIT.](https://i.imgur.com/txSgLPU.jpg)

###Your first goal is to master the Floor L-sit if you haven't already!

**Here are the general progressions:**

1. Two-Feet Supported L-sit
2. One Foot Supported
3. Tucked L-sit 
4. Less Tucked
5. L-sit

* Here is my [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUZJoSP66HI) that explains the above progressions if you haven't seen it already.  

**Time Frames to Follow for Success**

You generally want to aim for at least 60seconds of total/aggregate hold times, so this time table might help:

* 6x10sec
* 5x12sec
* 4x15sec
* 3x20sec
* 2x30sec

By the time you reach 3x20sec or 2x30sec, you're probably ready to move onto the next progression! (Try it, you won't die from testing it, trust me! I'm a doctor! jk not a real dr dont sue me)

#Pitfalls! Complaints! 

#""My hands are too short""

Your hands are most likely not too short. You're more likely to be lacking either the hamstring flexibility or the strength in your shoulders to be able to press your hands down against your bodyweight, or both.

Solution in the interim? Use some books or blocks underneath your hands to elevate them in the meantime as you master the foot supported L-sit.

#""Foot Supported is too easy but the Tucked L-sit is too hard!""

First of all, if you could hold the tucked L-sit for even just a couple seconds. GOOD JOB. Even that small amount is helpful at first. A couple seconds will become 5 seconds before you know it and then 10 and so on! Also, again, you could try elevating your hands on something and seeing if the tucked L-sit is doable there. But really the best way is to throw in 3 sets of **seated leg lifts** to help bridge the gap. [My follow along video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQXnOuQqKYc) 

---------------

#Foot-Supported L-sit Cue/ProTip for *everybody*

* To make your abs explode, drive your hips BACK behind you as your feet stay/slide on the floor. 

Even if you've mastered the L-sit and think the foot-supported versions are easy, you'll find that they aren't when you add this cue. This forces you to COMPRESS like a mother-fucker. The only limit for how hard you make this exercise is YOU. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

###If you have mastered the Floor L-sit, you can't get away choose from any of these options:

 * 45-90° V-sit (High tucked V -> [One Leg V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPduDnzySQ); Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFVRzjLGtl0))
 * [Advanced L-sit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u65MPOxux_s) (L-sit with a flat back by pushing hips *forward*)
 * Rings L-sit or V-sit (Hint: Master the Tucked RTO L-Sit first. Goal: RTO as much as possible)
 * L-sit Walks (Floor or Parallel Bars)
 * Manna ([tutorial by /u/awarenesss](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/60xtp2/manna_tutorial/))
 * Straddle L-sit (Rings or PB or Floor)
 * Ankle Weighted L or V-sit.

For detailed progressions on any of these or musings about which one to choose, my old blog post has info here: [Advanced L-sit, V-sit, Manna and Straddle L-sit Progressions](http://antranik.org/advanced-l-v-manna-progressions/)*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###Now that you've seen the options, TIME FOR YOUR TO CHECK IN!

* Stats: What is your gender, age, height, weight?

* Goal: What is your goal? (i.e., Floor L-sit)

* Current Progression: What progression are you at for the said goal and what is your current max hold time for the current progression? GO ahead, try it and maybe post a pic or photo! (i.e., Foot Supported L-sit, 20secs)

* If you're on Instagram, use the hashtag #redditbwf to spread the word and find other fellow bwfers on there (You can ""follow"" hashtags these days on IG).

So go ahead, test your max now for the progression you are at and let us know how it went and post a pic or video if you like as well.

#What now?!

Now, for a month, get in the habit of working on the progression exercises toward your goal. **Try to work on it three times a week.** You could do it daily as well but eventually you'll need some rest days, so try to find the balance there. But you better do it! Cause next week we're going to call you to give us an update and tell us or show us how it's going! And of course, questions and form checks are always welcome. (But I'll tell you from the get-go... LOCK YOUR KNEES AND POINT YOUR TOES!)

Why your homebrew routine is (probably) bad,tboneotter,683,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/veo2az/why_your_homebrew_routine_is_probably_bad/,1655494252.0,"Hey y'all!

So I frequent this sub, and a common thing that’s posted is something to the extent of “I’m just starting out, is this routine good/what exercises are good?” or ""I've been doing some at home/youtube video/workout app routines, are they good?"". To which I always say “Get on a routine that a professional made, like the RR in this subs wiki or one of the ones in the r/fitness wiki”. This post is going to break down why you should get on a premade routine (for at least the first 6 months of training), by addressing some of the main places where self-made or “homebrew” routines fall short, as well as doing a survey of the most commonly asked/misunderstood parts of training (progressive overload, etc.).

&#x200B;

A bit about me - I’ve been working out consistently (on a real routine) for just shy of two years. Before that, I did a bunch of “100 pushups a day” type “routines” (which are bad) for a while. I’m also fairly well informed on workout literature - I’ve been a frequent poster/reader/commenter here, watch a ton of youtube/instagram content (from good influencers like FitnessFAQ’s, not gymTok), have read some literature, listened to some podcasts, etc. I consider myself reasonably knowledgeable about workout theory - more so than the average joe - but even then, I don’t have a degree in exercise science. I have no formal instruction. I’m not a personal trainer. But that’s kinda the point, because if you’re just starting out, neither are you.

&#x200B;

That’s really the key here. I still use a routine someone else made - and always have, with minimal adjustments. The reason is that there's SO MUCH that goes into making a good routine, if you aren’t a professional, you’re almost certain to miss something. So let’s talk about what goes into a good routine, and where I see homebrew ones fall flat.

&#x200B;

1: **Progressive Overload** **- make it get harder.** This is the big one. Think of it like math class. Once you take algebra, you don't take more algebra. You move on to geometry. Then you work harder and move on to pre-calculus, and so on. If you keep doing algebra, even if you’re doing dozens of algebra problems a day, you’re not actually getting smarter math-wise, you’re just getting faster at doing algebra. Muscle building is the same way. If you actually want to get stronger (and you probably do), you need to consistently increase the difficulty of the exercises. This means it has to be HARD. For example, the recommended routine has you doing 3 sets of pushups, each set of only 5-8 reps. You find a pushup variation you can only do 3 sets of 5 reps of, then each session you try to add a rep so that you can do 3 sets of 8. This implements a systematic way of steadily increasing your abilities. This is the #1 reason follow-along routines, fitness “challenges” and the like are bad. They’re great for making you feel like you’ve worked out (and if your goals are simply “move more”, they’re fine), but they don’t actually produce sustainable results long-term. To actually look better, you need a system, and a certain amount of strength.

&#x200B;

2: **Strength Building - Don’t overcomplicate. Do a small amount of reps of a small amount of exercises.** Just about everyone wants to build muscle at least a bit. In fact, almost every fitness goal can be achieved by 1: putting on some muscle and 2: eating correctly for your goal. Let’s look at some common goals:

* Bulking? Build muscle, eat more than you burn.
* Cutting? Do strength training, eat less than you burn.
* Toning? That’s just fancy talk for having developed muscles with low enough body fat to see them.
* Looking good in a swimsuit? Build muscle, lose fat (either by cutting or recomposition).
* Men - “Tyler Durden/Ottermode/Bruce Lee look” is just strength training and keeping a lower weight/body fat %. Bruce Lee did barbell lifts. Practice your one punch a thousand times in supplement of a strength routine, not instead of one.
* Women -  strength training won't get you ""too bulky"". That's a myth. What you define as ""too bulky"" is the result of years of specialized training and dieting (and exceptionally hard work) to get that specific look. What you define as ""looking fit and attractive"" is done by strength training.

Now, building muscle/getting stronger is primarily done in the low rep range, and this is why the Recommended Routine has you do 3 sets of 5-8 reps. This isn’t to say you’re not getting any strength gains at higher rep ranges, but once you can do more than about 10-12 reps of an exercise, it starts to become more efficient to up the intensity and drop the reps. Lots of homebrew routines have rep ranges of 20+. A particularly egregious example is the all too common “upper day” that looks something like this:

3x20 Pushups

3x20 Tricep Pushups

3x20 Diamond Pushups

3x20 Wide Pushups

3x10 Decline Pushups

(Same goes for lower days with 80 bajillion squats/squat variations/lunges). Look, different types of pushups, or pullups, or squats, or whatever are effectively the same movement. There’s some nuance, sure, but the actual strength-building element is about the same. Most strength-based programs are going to have you do like sub 30 reps a session, because if you’re working hard, that’s more than enough. The RR has 15-24 a session, across 3 sets. Even super popular 5x5 programs are 25 reps. Doing these kinds of workouts with reps in the hundreds means you’re just going to be doing endurance work, and won’t see any noticeable strength (or size) gains. (For endurance, see point 6).

&#x200B;

3: **Balance of Exercises - pull on something.** The number of routines posted with 80 bajillion pushup/squat variations and no pulling motions are REALLY high. So let’s break it down - your body is split roughly into 4 groups - legs and core for lower body, and the upper body is split into muscles that push things away from you (chest and triceps) and ones that pull things to you (biceps and back), with your shoulders being hit with both movements. Honestly, if you’re doing compound movements, your core is going to get worked with every movement (squats and pushups are compound movements), so you don’t need a lot of that. But what you do need is pulling movements. I all but guarantee you have a place to do them - pullups are daunting/inaccessible to a lot of people, but you probably have a place to do rows. A bedsheet and door (hi Antranik: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=51&v=rloXYB8M3vU&feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=51&v=rloXYB8M3vU&feature=emb_title)) a broomstick and two equal-heighted tables/chairs/whatever, a sturdy table you can grab on the underside of, a swing set, a backpack you can fill with heavy things (like books or water jugs). I promise you you have options. Or just buy gymnastic rings.

&#x200B;

4: **Resting between sets - You should rest 1-3 minutes between sets**. Look. If you’re working hard, you should be gassed. Doing “every minute on the minute” or HITT routines will almost always cause your cardiovascular system to be strained before your muscles are (even though it will feel like the muscles are). This is why routines, like the RR, want you to rest for 1-3 minutes between sets. If you have 30 seconds between a set, you’re probably not recovered enough.

&#x200B;

5: **Resting between workouts - You shouldn’t hit the same muscle group every day.** Working out (microscopically) tears your muscles, then your body fills in the gaps with more muscle. That’s how you get stronger (simplified). You need to rest at least a day between workouts - this is part of why 3x/week is ideal for beginners. The actual *getting stronger* part of working out happens when you’re resting. Jack up the intensity, lower the amount of time.

&#x200B;

6: **A note on endurance - you still need to program.** If you want to focus on endurance, and not strength or hypertrophy, your programming will look a BIT different. But still, “100 pushups a day” routines don’t work. Why? No progressive overload. Someone made a post saying their army sergeant said “do max sets of pullups all day. That’s how mine went from 15 to 22 in 3 months” and it’s like…. Those are bad results. Follow an actual plan and you’ll be better. I suggest one of these:

* Russian Fighter Pullup Program: [https://www.strongfirst.com/the-fighter-pullup-program-revisited/](https://www.strongfirst.com/the-fighter-pullup-program-revisited/)
* Fitness FAQ’s 20 pull ups/50 push ups programs: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEmznUhN6IE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEmznUhN6IE) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMtlbOIBAY0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMtlbOIBAY0)
* Greasing the Groove: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki\_how\_do\_i\_.22grease\_the\_groove.22.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_.22grease_the_groove.22.3F) (good rule of thumb is 666 - 60% max reps, at least 6x/day, 6 times/week.)

&#x200B;

7: **A Note on diet - Don’t overcomplicate.** So, there’s SO MUCH diet info out there. High carb, low carb, keto, paleo, carnivore, whatever. But the simple truth is: Weight Change = Calories in - Calories out. About 3500 calories = 1 lb (\~.4 kg). You don’t want to gain or lose more than that a week. So, +- 500 calories/day = +- 1 lb/week. However, your body is going to fluctuate \~ 5 lbs (\~2.5 kg) daily. So, count all your calories, weigh yourself consistently (1-3x/week). If the scale isn’t trending the way you want in a month, you’re not doing it right. And make sure you eat protein.

There’s a ton to tracking macros, optimal protein intake, weighing food, etc., that I’m not qualified to go into (see the fitness wiki or r/loseit or r/gainit for more). But, simply getting to your weight goal means tracking your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) and how much you eat, and your weight.

7b: I'm not qualified to go into protien intake, but eat a lot of it.

&#x200B;

8: **Results - Yes, I did just say a month.** Working out takes TIME. If you’re here in early June wanting to look good for summer, you’re too late. In about 4 sessions you’ll get a bit better at the exercises. In about a month you’ll see changes in the mirror. In about two months your close friends will. In 3, you’ll start to look like you work out. I like to add that it takes 4 before you start to like to work out. I remember a blog post where the guy’s workout buddy said “don’t expect results in the first year of training”, and that stuck with me. The goal isn’t to look good for summer, the goal is to be healthy for your life.

8b: Paralysis by analysis is real. Just about any good routine (compound movements, progressive overload) is going to give you roughly the same results in the first 6 months of training. So do the Primer, jump into the RR, or pick the first one off the r/fitness wiki that you think works for you, and stick with it! At the start, focus way more on being consistent, getting the form down, and not routine-hopping than wondering if you're doing something ""optimal"".

&#x200B;

Look, overall this is a bunch of information - and I may have gotten some of it wrong. Let me know if I did, or if you want clarification. I really made this post because so many people have essentially the same question, and I wanted to be able to link this post/copy & paste parts of it, rather than re-typing.

5 Minute Lower Body Mobility,MovementTom,680,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/786uq4/5_minute_lower_body_mobility/,1508754907.0,"**Watch the video: https://youtu.be/aFYYrazyO-4**

Back again BWF people,

So I posted a [5-minute mobility routine](https://youtu.be/-tetoszaTTo) a while back and it got some great feedback and seemed to help a lot of people out. However, many people ask for some more love for the lower body so here it is.

The routine is made up of only 4 exercises but hits basically every range of motion needed. I've been using it for the past couple of months simply to maintain mobility with minimal effort. It makes a great lower body warm up as well.

If you don't want to watch the video, the routine is:

* A1. [Four Position Lifts](https://youtu.be/aFYYrazyO-4?t=1m36s) - 10r + 10s per side
* A2. [Cossack Squats](https://youtu.be/aFYYrazyO-4?t=2m5s) - 10r + 10s per side
* A3. [Assisted Single Leg Good Morning](https://youtu.be/aFYYrazyO-4?t=2m33s) - 10r + 10s per side
* A4. [Long Lunge](https://youtu.be/aFYYrazyO-4?t=2m54s) - 10r + 10s per side

Quickly spending 5 minutes daily to run through these basic patterns is a good way to grease the mobility groove but if you're looking to progress these ranges of motion then I would suggest doing it only 3-4x per week but repeating for 3 rounds.

Anyway, I thought that really distilling down lower body mobility would help make it a little bit simpler. Let me know your opinions on it and if there are any questions :)

I re-designed the Recommended Routine Workout Log,xemendy,678,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jr4e8s/i_redesigned_the_recommended_routine_workout_log/,1604950146.0,"I've been using this amazing Workout Log [Print-Friendly Workout Log](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mkTWWNwMEWnEIt_-fRA-qXhByIJbOJZE) by [u/AdamReds](https://www.reddit.com/u/AdamReds) , for last few months, and it's been super useful, but there were some needs it didn't covered for me. 

First, I love paper, I don't like to write down the number of reps in an app or an excell sheet, at least, while on the field. When I'm practicing my exercises, I like to have a pen, or a pencil, and a piece or paper. And write not just numbers, but notes, lots of notes! refering to technique, to quality of the exercise....I'm a ""quality over quantity"" person. Most Workout Logs are number-oriented, and the original design of this RR Workout Log has a place, down the page, for notes, but it wasn't enough for me.

Aditionally, my approach to the log and track of a routine is to set goals, and track them, micro-goals from day to day. For example, if I've managed to do 6 Pull-ups one day, the next day I should try to do 7, or to improve my technique. This indication is important to me, when I'm training the next day, I want to have this indication very handy, near from me. That's why I have an ""Estimated"" reps field, and another field for actual reps you've achieved. You try to do what's estimated, and you write down what you actually did. From this two pieces of data you can deduce a lot of things. 

It's really helpful to me to have  what i've planned for that day just in front of my eyes, even if I'm unable to achieve it, that teaches me I over-estimated myself.

Another thing was... in the original design, 1 day = 1 Page. But normally, I like to look what I did in my last training session. To improve this, and to save paper, I thought it would be nice to change the unit

1 week = 1 page

The whole week on a single page. It has to be a BIG page to squeeze all that, so I chose a bigger piece of paper: A3 format. This new design is a tri fold brouchure design in A3 format.

**So, conclusions:**

\- New format: A3, a whole week in a tri fold format, a bit more enviromental friendly.

\- Every exercise has it's own ""Notes"" field, for notes specifically refering to that exercise.

\- More fields for notes: Down in the page, huge white gap, and upper-right, another field for notes

\- Structure has been mantained (warm-up, triplets, pairs...), but names of the exercises have been removed, for simplicity, so you can fill the exact name of the progression you are in

\- Lots of good things from the original design has been kept

"For pullups and pushups, is it better to go to exhaustion each set?",Hiroshima_Kanuk,671,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ian5mn/for_pullups_and_pushups_is_it_better_to_go_to/,1597556564.0,"Now, when I got to the park I do super sets pull-ups, pushups and squats, usually four sets.

The pull-ups go 8/9 for the first set, then 5 then 4 and another 4, working to exhaustion each time.

Pushups 25, 15, 10, 10.

Squats \~25 each set, but not going to exhaustion.

Should I be doing fewer of each in the first sets so that I can do more in the later ones? Does it matter?

&#x200B;

Update edit:

First of all, thanks for all of the ideas. I thought maybe one or two people would pop in to give this old newbie some pointers, but the responses here are awesome! Personal techniques, scientific method, and routine suggestions, they're all fantastic.  


So, the consensus was fewer reps to start, and save some gas for later. I gotta admit, that squats number above was just an estimate because I was trying to simplify it for the post, in reality I was doing a mixed bag of squats and runner's arabesque. So below, it's just plain old deep body weight squats.

My first trip to the park since getting this advice:

Pull: 6   Push:15   Squat: 30    two minutes do nothing rest

Pull: 6   Push:15   Squat: 30    two minutes do nothing rest

Pull: 6   Push:14   Squat: 30    two minutes do nothing rest

Pull: 4+1sloppy   Push:10   Squat: 50  

Takeaways:

I'll stick with this for the pull ups. Pushups I will need to move up a progression soon, and squats move up a progression now.  
I'll take a look around the subreddit for those progressions.

Again, thanks to everyone!

Bodyweight workouts: beware of injuries,NFLAddict,678,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fpf21m/bodyweight_workouts_beware_of_injuries/,1585241881.0,"I felt the need to address this, as I continue to see posts from new people to the comminity. Please dont take this the wrong way, dont be discouraged, I just felt the need to bring attention to an important point, something that seems to not be emphasized nearly enough  

While its true that weightlifting likely leads to more injuries, I cant help but feel there is an attitude that calisthenics is viewed as safer, and a risky mindset that not much can go wrong  
  
To be honest, I don't know you all. I'm not gonna try to act like a parent, but from personal experience, I can at least try to help some people who might not have a serious enough attitude  
  
What do I mean: its no secret that heavily desired skills, include advanced moves like levers, flags, planche and even more. For seasoned bodyweight athletes, with very strong foundations, these are realistic goals. with patience of course.   
however, I see many newcomers immediately trying to do what it takes to breeze through progressions  
  
this is a very dangerous mindset. As a powerlifter who can moves quite a great deal of weight, and advanced calisthenics athlete, what might surprise many, Ive suffered zero injuries from weightlifting. rather, all my injuries were actually a result of calisthenics. whether it be overtraining, over eagerly rushing through progressions or carelessly jerking my body in different ways without the proper 'warning lights' going off in my mind that tell me to be careful. of course if somebody attempts a deadlift 3x bodyweight, theyre well aware how heavy that is, and the potential risks.   
  
bodyweight /calisthenics seems to have a more lax attitude and I implore you all to change that, whether it be newcomers trying to achieve a planche as quickly as possible, or veterans passing on the message. using the example of a planche, this is an incredibly advanced skill to most people. sure, if somebody trains bodyweight rigorously, and carefully, building up strength over time to move on to the next progression, its achievable, but for somebody who is just starting calisthenics I cant help but feel its giving tremendous false hope. Ive seen some advise people relatively new with bodyweight training, to already begin pseudoplank pushups. to me, this is just one example of a mistake. a great deal of mobility work and careful, patient, practice of straight arm strength that places tremendous strain on the shoulders should not be simply tossed around as suggestions. people might attempt them, and might even deceive themselves into thinking theyre ready to take on a new progression before theyre body is truly ready. by that I mean properly conditioned. **you cannot rush conditioning** it takes time for bodies to grow accustomed to movements or positions that put joints in very strenuous positions. rather, an extreme emphasis should be noted on how one should be determined to go about their journey, but with realistic expectations, and proper warning of the injury risk it presents. just because weights arnt involved does not mean injuries cannot happen.   
in fact, gymnasts seem to get injured all the time. even elite ones. other things like doing something everyday without proper rest and recovery time is also dangerous habit. this leads to overstressing the muscle, overtraining, usually such that cannot be felt at the time, but rather over months or years of such heavy loads of training, injuries develop  
  
*Forgive the long post, but with so many newcomers who continue to come to this sub in hopes of guidance, I think its only responsible for us to properly communicate not only the benefits (which their are plenty - this isn't supposed to be a negative post) but also to properly educate/warn/caution what can go wrong. if they don't rest enough, if they move through progressions to quickly, without developing that needed foundation of strength that can only be gained through months of hard work and careful conditioning. stretching, mobility work, and proper recovery are just as important. and advising people to even just keep an eye on how their body is responding.  
  
lastly, ill just bring the example of the one arm chin/pullup. I see this all too often. hanging from a pullup bar with just one arm places stress so tremendous on the shoulders that if somebody isn't extremely conditioned they are at literal immediate risk of a tear, right there and then. if somebody can do 10 pullups they are not ready for a one arm chin. I don't care if its negatives. this is about being responsible. people that do one arm chins successfully are typically ones that have trained calisthenics for years, building exceptional balance throughout their body, and super important - properly building the needed stability.   
  
Just using ones bodyweight is not often thought to be something that risks injury, and for the most part that is true. sticking to fundamentals. pushups. pullups. core exercises, flexibility and mobility work...and even progressions...but those progressions need to be done carefully and patiently. or injuries will factor in.   
  
sorry to sound so negative. I just think we need to be aware of the risks just as much as we are aware of the benefits."

"If health is my only concern, is it enough to do yoga, pilates and running?",Holmbone,674,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hcnh1n/if_health_is_my_only_concern_is_it_enough_to_do/,1592664529.0,"30 yo woman here. For most of my childhood and adolescence the only exercise I did was running. As I become an adult I realized that strength and flexibility are important too and started working on those. I have some slight back problems (likely from working stationary in an office) and I did weight lifting exercises designed to help with that for about two years. I've also donee yoga and pilates, and kept up the running. But it's been hard to find time and motivation for all of them. I'm thinking about dropping the weight liftning, since it hasn't really helped with my back problems, to just focus on the yoga and pilates for a while. But I don't know if those offer enough of a strength exercise. Any thoughts?

Edit: thanks for all the comments, I had no idea I'd get this many. My take away is that I should try to keep some of my pulling exercises which I'm currently doing. Also that I should try again to get some proper diagnosis for my back pain. I have tried but the doctor referred me to a physiotherapist who just assumed a cause and gave me exercises."
Body Before and After 2 years of working out without proper knowledge,whiteSkar,670,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/agifkz/body_before_and_after_2_years_of_working_out/,1547620573.0,"&#x200B;

* Ending stats: 64.5 kg. Estimated body fat = 13\~14% (Dexa gives me 18%, BMI scale gives me 11%, body caliper gives me 9%...)
* Detailed diet and/or exercise routine(s) used: Did not follow a specific diet. Just kept my ordinary diet but tried to eat more meats so I get more proteins. Started having protein powders in the morning and after workouts after 1 year and 6 months after starting.  
Edit (forgot to write): Started 1 session per week for the first 4 months. 2 sessions per week for the next 4 months. 3 sessions per week for the next 4 months. Started doing split sessions which I shouldn't have.. Then kind of maintained 3 sessions per week for the year after. (goal was to start small until it becomes habit and slowly increase). Main focus was on pull ups and then push ups / dips / leg raises / basic squats. Additionally did handstands / tuck levers / tuck planches / etc.
* Before and after photos (for progress posts only):  [https://www.instagram.com/p/BsE3p7kHKOX/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsE3p7kHKOX/)

So, the above pic is about 3 weeks ago comparing with myself 2 years ago. I had a personal goal to make a before and after pic after working out for 2 years mainly doing body weight training without changing my diet. I anticipated my progress will be really slow without following the correct diet plan but making two changes (starting working out and following a strict diet) felt too much at that time. So I decided to let's first make working out my lifestyle and then after when I don't feel burdened to change my diet, let's change diet. Also, I wanted to see it with my eyes how much change I can see without following a special diet. After 2 years, this proved out to be less drastic change than I hoped though it is still a pretty big satisfactory achievement.

I felt working out has become a habit after about 6\~8 months of working out. I felt working out has become a lifestyle after about 12\~18 months. Now that my personal project of working out without diet for 2 years and working out has become a lifestyle, I am planning to change my diet a bit to meet the macros correct. Also, I hit some plateau for a long time especially around my pull ups since I went from 0 pull ups to 12 pull ups in 12 months (which was another goal I achieved) but then after, for the rest of the 12 months, I couldn't go up more than 13 pull ups.

I realized, without learning how working out actually works, I won't improve more. That's when (December 2018) I bought Overcoming Gravity and watched Eric Helm's videos about pyramid of working out and nutrition. I'm still reading Overcoming Gravity and also learning a lot from here, bwf. For up coming future, my plan is to learn from Overcoming Gravity, bwf, and Eric Helm's books (which I also bought), and apply it to my workout routines and diet and overcome the plateau and grow faster than before.

Just sharing my journey of working out without proper knowledge and possibly inspire other beginners like me so they won't spend too much time without proper knowledge (at least follow the Recommended Routines, which I hoped to knew about from the start rather than after 2 years..). Expect to see a much better body of myself when/after 2019 ends."

Anyone else switch over to BWF/home workouts full time from the gym?,randomnessthoughts,666,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/m682kq/anyone_else_switch_over_to_bwfhome_workouts_full/,1615898168.0,"I used to be an avid gymgoer and went 5x a week to lift weights. I did some BWF along the side too, mostly pull ups and dips at the park. 

When the pandemic hit a year ago, I had to stop going to the gym since they all closed and switched to BWF full time. At first it sucked because I was basically only limited to pull ups, push ups, and dips and it got boring pretty fast. However, I got a set of rings during the summer (hanging it up on my doorway pull up bar) and it has been a complete game-changer. 

Since I WFH, nowadays I'm able to get a solid workout in throughout my day which saves a ton of time. I usually do sets throughout the day, and oftentimes when there's a lull during work I can get a good workout in. Ring workouts are fun but I lowkey prefer weights SLIGHTLY more... eventually when I get a house I definitely want to have a home gym setup. But what tips the scales for me is the amount of time I save every day. In the past I had to dedicate an extra hour per day to the gym (luckily I used to live next to mine), but nowadays since my workouts are spread out through my working every day I basically get that extra hour back. 

The main benefit of BWF for me over weights is the amount of ""functional"" strength I get. I do grappling and tricking as well and I feel like the heightened amount of body awareness and core strength from BWF has definitely spilled into grappling/tricking performance. Also, rings has definitely been healthier for my joints (esp shoulders) compared to weights... I used to always have really sore rotator cuffs after lifting but nowadays even after hard BWF sessions I rarely ever have shoulder pain anymore. 

Just wondering if anyone else here has had a similar experience switching over to BWF full time. 

My exercises for anyone who's curious: 

Push - 
Ring dips/RTO dips
Ring pushups
Pseudo-planche pushups

Pull -
Regular pullups
OAC isometric holds (still working on a full OAC)

[Before and After](https://ibb.co/nmRdSDW)



**Background**



Beginning of quarantine I was 160lbs (72.5kg). I started running and dropped some weight, and then I found the recommended routine.



I have never worked out. I do hike, some yoga, and surf. I have been following the recommend routine for 3 months, and I have incorporated running (did my first half marathon this week!)



I purchased rings about 6 weeks ago and that has been the purchase I have made in a long time!



**Routine**



5x3 Typewriter ring pull ups

6x3 Deep step ups

6x3 Ring Dips

7x3 Harop Curls

6x3 Front tuck lever rows

10x3 Archer ring push ups

12x3 Ring roll ups

12x3 Banded Pallof Press

12x3 Reverse Hyperextension



I have also been mountain biking, running, and hiking on exercise days or as an active rest day.



**Diet**



This is my biggest weakness. I eat whatever I want all the time. I do not count calories, but I do not eat the worst things--I just don't keep track of anything and treat myself to goodies. But it usually looks like this:

Wake up: Coffee/Cream of Wheat

Post workout: Protein Shake

Snack-Fruit

Lunch- Sandwich or eggs and toast

Dinner- Burger or Burrito

Usually asleep by 10:00pm and awake by 6:00am, and sometimes I am able to squeeze a nap in during the day.

**Questions**

1. When should I try a muscle-up or work on one? I feel I may have the strength, but I feel weird about doing it when I am tired/on a rest day/before a workout.

2. What would you estimate my body fat%? I was thinking about 18%.

3. Is it possible to do too much cardio and that would prevent gains?


**Conclusion**

I love the Recommended Routine, and I have fun doing it. I am about to turn 30 and I am in the best shape of my life.



**TL;DR: Love the recommended routine!**"

I'm a long time lurker, and have learnt a lot from a bunch of you. I've been doing BWF for a few months and have fallen in love with the feeling of progression in BWF and calisthenics. In fact, it reminded me a lot of the skill charts you often find in video games like WoW, Borderlands, etc. I decided to embark on a small side project, which was to combine these two loves of mine into a tool that others can find useful. So here it is;

This is literally the MVP, so I'm going to try and stay motivated to keep updating this thing, but if there are any devs/designers out there that want to collaborate that would be hella rad.

Right now, it saves your data to the browser, which means that after a while it may up and vanish. (I've got a whole roadmap of features and upgrades I want to give this). One of my next tasks being to fill out the exercise information with something other than Lorem Ipsum, or Lilith's action. :sweat-smile: . I'm also going to replace the barbell icon with icons individual to each milestone exercise.

I would love to know your thoughts, whether this is useful for you, if you've found any bugs, if you have any suggestions, etc etc.

disclaimer: i've only tested this on Chrome (desktop and mobile) and it works. I will likely not spend too much time trying to get it working cross-browser, but I might add it to my todo list if it straight up doesn't work.

My progress: 28 weeks later,atlacamayeh,672,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bz1awu/my_progress_28_weeks_later/,1560190842.0,"M, 26, 5’6 (1.68m)

Starting weight (Nov. 2018): 147 lbs (\~66.5 kg)  
Current weight (Jun. 2019): 128 lbs (\~ 58 kg)

&#x200B;

**Background**

In November of last year I started a weight loss program coupled with the RR and wanted to share some results I’ve seen so far. I’ve been a bit chubby since middle school and though my BMI never reached ‘overweight,’ I had never really followed an exercise routine and felt it was time to give it a go. I was really drawn to the BWF routine because of the progression framework, since even a total beginner like me could find somewhere to get started. Also, I very much wanted a routine that I could do at home and didn’t want to initially invest too heavily into equipment. I started out with a pull up bar and a yoga mat, and bought a set of rings a few weeks in as I started progressing.

My primary goal for these first few months has been weight loss/aesthetics much more than gaining strength or skill, though I have noticed some moderate progress in my ability to carry out the RR which has been really satisfying.

My routine has been as follows:

&#x200B;

**Training**

Strength training (RR):  
*3x/week, 3 sets of each exercise, progress shown from Nov. 2018 -> Jun. 2019:*

&#x200B;

Pull up negatives (8 reps) --> ‘Real’ (unweighted) pull ups (6 reps)  
Squats (8 reps) --> Squats (20 reps)  
Bench dips (8 reps) --> Ring dips (5 reps)  
Hanging leg raises (3 reps) --> Hanging leg raises (8 reps, 6s hold each rep)  
Romanian deadlift (8 reps) --> Romanian deadlift (12 reps)  
Assisted push ups (8 reps) --> Push ups (10 reps)  
Incline rows (10 reps, using u/Antranik’s bedsheet method) --> ‘nearly’ horizontal rows (13 reps, using rings)  
Plank (20 sec) --> Plank (60 sec)

&#x200B;

Cardio:  
*2x/week starting in March, stationary bike or elliptical, 45min-1hr*

&#x200B;

**Diet**

Since my primary goal was to lose weight, I have been pretty focused on tracking my calorie consumption and, to a lesser degree, my macronutrient intake. Using a number of calculators and adjusting over time, I believe my TDEE to be around 2000 kcal so my goal has been to consistently eat at a 500 calorie deficit. Allowing for a couple of cheat days here and there, my daily averages have been as follows for the past 28 weeks:

Energy: 1530 kcal  
Protein: 98 g  
Fats: 52 g  
Carbohydrates: 152 g  
Sugar: 35 g

&#x200B;

**Progress/outlook**

Overall, I’m fairly satisfied with how I’ve been able to lose a good amount of excess weight and improve my physique with this strategy:

&#x200B;

**Progress Pics:** [**Front/Side/Back**](https://imgur.com/a/DiyLF6T)

&#x200B;

Nonetheless, I have noticed that my progress in terms of aesthetics has pretty much plateaued in the past few weeks. This isn’t totally surprising, since I clearly didn’t have very much muscle to begin with and I understand there’s only so far you can get with cutting. At this stage, I am weighing two different strategies:

* Continuing to cut to lose a few more pounds and hopefully that last bit of belly fat

or

* Eating at or slightly above maintenance to focus more solidly on strength work and 'fill out,' so to speak.

As I am still undoubtedly a beginner in terms of the exercise progressions (and fitness programs in general), I’m not sure if it’s too early to jump into a new strategy. For this reason, I wanted to ask if you all had any suggestions on how to progress moving forward: Which of the above options (or any different one) would you recommend? Should I increase exercise volume? Do you have a recommended way to integrate cardio? Should I have progressed more quickly?

&#x200B;

In general, I’m pretty happy with the progress I’ve been able to make and am starting to feel more confident in front of the mirror. This community in particular has been really amazing in helping me plan out my journey and I’m really excited for what’s to come.

&#x200B;

"A Tip to get more out of your Sets, maintain proper form and Up the Intensity -> Intra-Set Rest ✓",L00WN0on,665,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/iipmk4/a_tip_to_get_more_out_of_your_sets_maintain/,1598693285.0,"First of all, this is what worked FOR ME, for some of you it will work for others it might not make a big change, and that's okay! There are other ways to up the intensity of your workouts. Now, cutting to the chase this is what I wanted to share with you guys:

- So, have you ever felt that on certain exercises you could bang out more reps but some factors like, balance, equilibrium or maintaining proper form or just the mental push were a limiting factor? *Because I certainly have!*

Two months ago I started to implement small Intra-Set rests of about 10-15s and I must say it has helped a lot in reaching a higher intensity threshold and even failure while maintaining proper form.
Two exercises where the difference was really big where, (1) Pistol Squats and (2) Ring Dips. We know these exercises have a big balancing component to them and sometimes achieving failure and using ""perfect"" form throughout the set can be difficult and sometimes you wish you could do a couple more reps, especially if you are a beginner and balancing/equilibrium can be really difficult at first.

Intra-Set resting allowed me to maintain better form and bang out more reps, for eg. I was at 19 Pistol Squats per leg, when I started to implement a 10-15s pause when my form was starting to not be ""perfect"" but still OK (around rep 15) I was able to then do another 9 reps with better form than if I had done the straight set, ending up doing 24reps total and reaching failure, arguably safer (?). I did this test on the Ring dips to and same thing came to pass. To further test this, yesterday I tested my straight set Pistol Squats and was able to bang out 18 ""perfect"" reps and 6 more with OK form putting my straight set total at 24reps (I am currently doing 30reps with the Intra-Set rest method), so I think it can also be used for strength and size gains.

Would love to hear thoughts on this!

Couple of notes I would like to leave here:
- ""Perfect Form"" -> Pretty good form that would be considered safe by everyone without or with minimal to no shaking, controlled both Concentrically and Eccentrically.

- ""OK"" -> By no means bad but with some shaking and with some difficulty completely controlling the movement in all its points.

Edit: Thank you SOO MUCH for the awards guys! Have a great day!"
Need more hamstring work? Try Single-leg Floor Slides,SuspiciousLeek4,664,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gkzyrj/need_more_hamstring_work_try_singleleg_floor/,1589654865.0,"Just posting because I never see these mentioned on this sub (maybe I'm blind). Most people find floor slides to be easy, and then move on. Give single leg slides a chance!

Great exercise for anyone who wants to work their hamstrings without weight. All you need is a floor and something that slides! I use a tupperware lid on a wood floor. Rags, furniture sliders, or even thick socks are also good options.

I was taught to do these in physical therapy for a knee injury. [Here is a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzAtOaY1-Dk), though I was not taught to perform as explosively as this guy. I like this video because he keeps his butt off the ground for the entire movement, which many do not. This will seriously increase the difficulty."
Dress for Success...Especially in the Gym,None,667,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/di0isz/dress_for_successespecially_in_the_gym/,1571102733.0,"Im sure you all have heard the saying ""dress for success"" as I have. Today, I decided to apply that to my gym life too! Instead of wearing old beaten up t-shirts to the gym that have the fitting of a tent, I decided to grab a pair of scissors, watch a couple YouTube tutorials, and make myself some gym tanks. I have to say this has been one of the best decisions I have made in regards to my gym life after downloading the Clank fitness app. Instead of looking at myself in the mirror and seeing a skinny guy with a baggy old t-shirt on, I see that I actually have made some decent progress over the past month or so, and that it shows. More so, I can see my self getting more fit and ripped in the future now that I have this new mindset. Moral of the story is, if your goal is to be jacked af, dress like you already are. No is going to care or judge you for it, because lets be honest, when you are at the gym, you only care about yourself. But the confidence and motivation you get from it is unparalleled."
Lessons learned from triceps tendonitis rehab,RepresentativeWay0,669,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/c46k4c/lessons_learned_from_triceps_tendonitis_rehab/,1561304536.0,"Disclaimer: rule 2 says this sub is not the place for seeking medical advice, however, I fixed my injury with the help of a physical therapist and I believe the lessons I have learned are valuable. When I was initially injured I tried to look for information online, but couldn't find anything relevant to triceps tendonitis. If anyone thinks I am out of line you can comment and I will delete the post.

Around 7 months ago I tried going zero-to-hero with pushups. I did far too much volume and incorporated weighted pushup without having good enough form for such training intensity. As a result, I began suffering from an aching pain in my elbow (located exactly where this image is pointing [https://www.handandwristinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/WHatIs.jpg](https://www.handandwristinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/WHatIs.jpg)) that wouldn't go away (after I had stopped doing pushups and other pushing movements). Eventually, I was able to ask a PT for advice, and within a month I was fully healed and able to do regular pushups again.

**What doesn't work**

* **Rest** \- Resting for a full 6 months seemed to have no effect on the injury.
* **Ice and heat** \- Ice can numb the pain temporarily, but reducing inflammation can actually slow down healing. Any kind of temperature change did not lead to improvement.
* **Stretching**
* **Foam rolling** \- Foam rolling my tricep feels nice, but did not aid in healing. I still do it after workouts.

**What worked**

* **Eccentrics -** Using a timer to do the eccentric (lowering) portion of an exercise for 4 seconds.
* **Table pushups** \- Before speaking to the PT I thought doing any form of pushup was out of the question, but table pushups were actually the perfect rehab exercise. They provided stimulus exactly to the injured area while keeping the weight bearing low enough as to not aggravate the injury (I only started doing these after rest, do not start rehabbing when a new injury is still acute).

**My program**

3x10 slow eccentric (4 seconds down, 1 second up) pushups every day. After a month I was pain-free and able to switch to slow regular pushups (2x10) and progressing the reps and sets from there."

Before: 103kg / 227lbs

After weight loss: 78kg / 171lbs

After crazy bulk: 105kg / 231lbs

Now: 95kg / 209lbs
____________________________________________

**Workouts**
When I decided to finally do it I went to the floor and struggled doing 1 horribly ugly pushup. Afterwards I sat on the couch being blown away by how weak I am. I worked out at home for a while not making much progress due to the hormone problems I mention in the video. Figured maybe I need to lift heavy so I joined a small gym that opened up near my parents place but it didn't change anything. After a year or so I switched back to bodyweight workouts. 

During that time a instructor at work hung up a pull-up bar in the office and I hated it. I tried everyday and never could do a single pull-up after working out for like a year while all the short and skinny people had no problem and of course made fun of me. The one dude who works out is the one how can't do it. I felt so heavy weighing 100kg with basically no muscle mass it was insane. Jut hanging on the bar was very challenging. 

You can see my current ""gym"" in my apartment in the video. Its just a home made pull-up bar and gymnastic rings. Sometimes I go to a calisthenics park.

**The routine:** Almost all my workouts are the exact same. I like supersets. I do pull-ups/chin-ups, dips and 1 legged bodyweight squats all in one set. Then rest and repeat at least 5 times but usually until I struggle doing half reps. Once I am burned out I finish my workout with some dumbbell work. Usually also supersets like bicep curl & overhead press. Main reason I started the dumbbells was since it took me so long to be able to do dips on the rings my shoulders where lacking behind and they started catching up since. 

The main reason why I didn't follow a proper routine like the one in the wiki before is simply my weight and hight. But now I'm starting to get strong so I want to really focus on skill work and I think Im about to hit a muscle up.

____________________________________________

**Diet**
When I lost all the weight I tried mostly everything. If I had to pick what worked the most I would say no carbs. Don't think its more effective then any other diet but it helped a lot with controlling my insane hunger. When I did the crazy bulk I ate everything I wanted all the time while trying to include a lot of protein. Whole chicken in one meal, ice cream, whole milk, cereal, sandwiches, steak... I know what most of you think but to give some context I was kind of skinny fat and very under muscled from my dieting and the hormone problems and once I finally had healthy levels I didn't care if I gain fat I just wanted to get strong and gain muscle and it worked trumendisly. It was like I finally went trough puberty at 21 and bulked the whole time. I ended up and 105kg so heavier then before but I looked and felt so much better you cant even compare. Instead of carrying all my weight around my hips and stomach it was spread out everywhere with a much better foundation of muscle underneath. Got compliments all the time and just felt great.

**Currently:** 
I follow the Vertical Diet. It's mainly red meat, rice, potatoes, spinach, eggs, salmon, carrots and fruit. Its supposed to cover all micros and macros while focusing on digestion health. I like it a ton. But I don't follow it like crazy If I want anything else I will eat it as well. If I eat within reason meaning follow the vertical diet and have a random ice cream, cereal or sandwich on top of it I maintain my weight without counting calories. I haven't really counted in a app since I lost all the weight. I just don't like it. I much rather eat my regular diet everyday and try not to go too crazy on the desserts without worrying about the numbers."
"Take these tests to troubleshoot your handstand, Find out which areas are holding you back.",heweijun8,673,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/71s65d/take_these_tests_to_troubleshoot_your_handstand/,1506098135.0,"Hey ya'll! I put this thing together that can help you trouble shoot your handstand.

Handstands, one of the basic and frustrating skills to get , especially if you're tight and heavily muscled, getting into position and balancing is frustrating as hell.

What I've noticed and had to learn the hard way is that no matter what progressions are put in front of you, if your body cannot reach those positions while not under stress, it'll make your handstand a lot harder to get.  Which means , more failure and longer learning curve.

I've put together these self assessment tests that you can determine what you should work on and how to get the flexibility and mobility for a great handstand.  Most people will have the toughest time in the thoracic area and lats so you'll see the solution generally over laps for many of the restrictions.

**Disclaimer** 
These tests are meant to serve as a benchmark for your handstand ability.  They do not replace the assessment by a medical professional.  Consult with your doctor before starting any exercise program.  


**You Will Fall Into 1 of 3 Categories**

Too tight = high stability / low mobility:

Most of your time will be spent doing mobility work in addition to the appropriate handstand progression.

Too loose = high mobility / low stability 

Most of your time will be spent doing strength work alongside your handstand progressions.

Just right 

Congratulations you passed all the tests no problem and your alignment is great. Spend equal amount of time on stability and mobility work but most of your time will be spent with handstand progressions and conditioning.



**Assessment: Troubleshoot Your Handstand**

**Wrist Test**

**PROCEDURE:**
Wrist Extension 70-90°  

Normal ranges should be within 70-90 ° without pain.  Ideal for handstands should be 90 ° without pain and strong.


Start with your arm raised in front of you with your palm facing down
Use your other hand to extend the wrist backwards.

Wrist Flexion 60-90°

Normal ranges will be 60-90 ° without pain.


Start with your arm raised in front of you with your palm facing down
use your other hand to extend the wrist backwards. 

Positive Signs of limitations 

Pain in wrist extension, unable to reach 90 ° in a handstand, tightness in forearm

 
**Wall Angel Chest Test**

 
**PROCEDURE:**
Stand about 12 inches from the wall
Position the arms in a 90/90 position
Abdominals contracted to bring low back to wall
Raise arms up to straighten until you cannot hold the flat back position

https://youtu.be/_O0BDba57Lg

POSITIVE SIGNS For Lack Flexibility:
 
If the head comes forward or your back goes into excessive (relative) lumbar extension = Failed test


90/90 position flush against the wall - If you are unable to touch the wall without discomfort, tightness or having extension in the back = Failed test 


**Lat Length Test** 
A lot of adult athletes are tight around the lats which may be restricting your overhead ability for handstands and lifts.  To test if you have a restriction do the lat length test here:

https://youtu.be/VqFYIJM7ym8

**PROCEDURE:**

1.Lay supine (face up)

2.Fully elevate arms in forward flexion

3.Keep your back flat

4.If arms normal length , arms will lay flat against the table

5.Tuck knees in and repeat above instructions.

POSITIVE SIGNS OF LIMITATIONS:
If the scapula does not lay flat while maintaining flat back = lats short

As you bring your knees to your chest, with your arms raised above, your arms lift up and your rib cage lifts.

Difficulty contracting the abdominals to bring the rib cage down and close the gap in the low back

**Thoracic Mobility Tests** 

**PROCEDURE:**

Upper thoracic mobility is important for overhead mobility. In the Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA), 3 important tests include
Multi-segmental flexion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqAY2zGGhCA
Extension - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCIgHBL20h0
Rotation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoUOOds_a7o
Locked Lumbar Thoracic rotation test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqZAIMLtlTc

**POSITIVE SIGNS For limitations:**
========================================================
**EDIT - Forgot to throw these in here, really important for these tests**
========================================================

**Ideal for handstands range**
Cold toe touch / chest to knees for press handstand

Gradual curve through the spine

Hips move past toes without conscious effort

Shoulders move in extension in line

Position 1 50° or more

Position 2 70° or more

Position 3 70° or more

http://thedaoofaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pasted-image-0-263.png

http://thedaoofaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pasted-image-0-224.png

Other considerations
For the Locked Lumbar Thoracic rotation tests. As you rotate to both sides, if the angle is >50° on one side = tightness in thoracic rotation.
If both sides are >50° or feel tight = tightness in thoracic extension.


**Lumbar Lordosis Test** 

Lumbar lordosis – A posture/position that can be caused by a variety of different things.   The Wall angels and Lat length test is a great way to spot lordosis in a flexed or extended position.  In a handstand, your entire body will affect your ability to “pull your ribs in”.  Getting at the cause will help fix it. Main things that cause excess lumbar lordosis can include tight lats, tight hip flexors, excessive thoracic kyphosis/tight pecs/rounded shoulders, and anterior pelvic tilt.

Generally for APT (anterior pelvic tilt) if you are female and have >13° there may be an issue, for males >7°.

If you have any consistent sharp pain, or previous injuries that haven’t been addressed, please seek professional counsel from a Physical Therapist, Chiropractor or Orthopedic Physician.

**POSITIVE SIGNS FOR LIMITATIONS:**

An arched handstand even when you contract your core as hard as you can

Poor posture 

Weak core or not conditioned core

Difficulty pulling rib cage down through abdominal contractions and “closing the window” in the low back when lying supine

Tight lats, pecs, poor thoracic rotation and poor scapular movement


 
**Thomas Test** 

Simple assessment used to examine the length of the muscles involved in hip flexion. Assessing their length can help you determine the tightness of your primary hip flexor muscles, including the rectus femoris, iliopsoas and iliotibial (IT) band.

https://vimeo.com/232660485



**PROCEDURE:**

Lay supine (face up), with lower gluteal folds at the end of the table and bring your knees to your chest (you may hold the legs in flexion with your hands).
Makes sure your lower back is not so high off the table.
Keep the one leg flexed (knee to chest), and slowly lower the target leg and let it extend as far as it can.

**POSITIVE SIGNS FOR LIMITATIONS**

The affected knee stays extended – Short QUADS:
The affected hip remains flexed – Short Psoas muscles:
Abducted affected hip – Short TFL(tensor fasciae latae)/ ITB(iliotibial band)
Contralateral hip flexes without knee extension- Tight Iliopsoas
Knee extension – Tight Rectus Femoris
Lateral rotation of tibia- Tight Biceps Femoris

**Solution - How to unlock your shoulders, hip flexors, lats and thoracic area**

These are the main exercises I like to do to address all those problem areas.  Eventually the list shortens as you figure out what works best for you.

Looking back after two years (aka: All the things I wish I’d paid attention to from the start),None,667,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4wqpjx/looking_back_after_two_years_aka_all_the_things_i/,1470670386.0,"Roughly two years ago I stumbled into this sub, and to make a long story very short…you people changed my whole world.  I’ve spent a considerable amount of time reading through the hoards of good advice that fills this place, and wanted to offer an attempt at giving something back.  These ideas aren’t unique (in fact they’re posted all over this sub), but they’re the ones that have done me the most good along the way.

&nbsp;

**Patience (and how to keep at this whole body weight fitness thing).**

Going slow is murder when you’re first starting out.  “How long until I’ll be able to muscle up/front lever/back lever/planche/flag/insert other skill here?!?!?” is the only question you’ll want answered.  I still remember the first time I watched a youTube video that involved muscle ups and a front lever.  Blew my mind.  Blew it clean off.  I was going to learn how to do that crazy shit, yes sir I was.  I was shocked (shocked!) when it became apparent that I wasn’t going to master these feats of strength in a couple of months.  Here’s the harsh truth.  There’s no time frame, no guarantee on how long it’s going to take you, and the desire for any particular skill isn’t going to be enough to keep you going.  The good news is that with dedication and consistency, you won’t care.  You’ll get to a point where the practice makes you feel better, you crave it, and it’s something you enjoy doing in your free time.  It doesn’t happen overnight, but it does happen.  Don’t give up.

&nbsp;

**Warm up like your life depends on it (because it kind of does).**

Warming up is important.  Do it.  Do it well.  Especially when you’re first starting.  Especially when you’ve been at it for a while.  Especially always.  I die a little on the inside whenever I watch someone go from zero to maximum effort with nothing in-between.  They die a little physically, so I figure it’s an even trade.  Seriously, warm up well.  Your body will thank you and you’ll be less likely to injure yourself.

&nbsp;

**Form. Is. Everything.**

I could write an entire book on this one.  I won’t (they already exist…you should read them), and instead I’ll simply say this.  Doing an exercise fewer times and correctly is vastly superior to doing an exercise more times and incorrectly.  Your goal is full range of controlled, correct motion.  Always.  Don’t sacrifice range of motion or control for increased difficulty.  Uncontrolled strength without mobility is useless (and how you hurt yourself).

&nbsp;

**Focus on your weak spots.**

This one is annoying, but it pays dividends down the line.  If you aren’t sure where your weak spots are, here’s a quick way to get an idea.  That exercise you hate doing, that’s a weak spot.  Focus on it.  Fix it.  Love it.  

&nbsp;

**What you eat matters (a whole lot).**

If you’re going to put in the effort to properly break your body down, you had better provide it the goods to rebuild itself.  If you don’t, then what was the point of tearing it up in the first place?  Eating well will significantly increase your results.  So will getting enough sleep, but that has nothing to do with eating.

&nbsp;

**Train often.**

I’m not suggesting that you do the same routine every day.  There are differing views on how often to train any particular part of your body, and I'll not insert my thoughts on that here.  What I am suggesting is that you do something every day.  I’m only one man (which is waaaaay too small of a sample size to say anything meaningful, take a stats class…you’ll love it) and this is entirely anecdotal, but the difference in my results between training three days, five days, and seven days a week was substantial.  Again, I’m not saying that you should do the same routine seven days a week, that’s insane, but that you should figure out some sort of beneficial movement to do every day.

&nbsp;

That’s it!  That’s a lie.  That’s nowhere near it.  There’s always more.  More to learn, more to do, another level in the skill that needs working.  For now, those are the main themes that have been with me for the last two years.  I hope they help!"
Morning workout people - how do you hit it hard when you're all rickety?,80dreams,663,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/un53rc/morning_workout_people_how_do_you_hit_it_hard/,1652257800.0,"I have a dream. Not as important as Martin Luther King Jr's, but important to me nonetheless.

I have a dream that one day I'll be able to roll out of bed and crush my BW workout first thing in the morning.

Sadly, 80% of the time when I get up I feel like I'm undergoing rigor mortis. So I either end up:

\- Warming up for ages. Which defeats the purpose as I want to workout early to get it done early.  
\- Working out while feeling rickety. Which worries me because I feel like I'm going to snap.  
\- Skipping it/doing it later.

Does anyone have any experience with remedying this? Is it a matter of a quicker warmup, am I wrong about not wanting to workout rickety? I'm open to anything.

For reference, I've been working out regularly for about two years. I run a super simple program. When I workout I do 3x sets of a push, pull, and legs movement taken to technical failure and some accessories."
I did GtG with weighted dead bugs for 3 months and got a lot of core strength gains,pneumatic_piston,665,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g5mn05/i_did_gtg_with_weighted_dead_bugs_for_3_months/,1587499809.0,"My abs used to be very weak. I couldn't even hold the middle position of a sit-up for a few seconds without having my lower back bend backwards untill i worked my abs with dead bugs. So i wasn't able to do most ab exercises. But, now i can even hold a hollow hold for almost a minute while keeping my back perfectly flat. (No, i don't have visible abs. They are hidden under some unnecessary fat)

I especially focused on my form. With each rep, i paused at the bottom position, activated my glute to deactivate my hip flexors, exhaled and pushed my ribs in. I kept my back flat and kept my pelvic posteriorly tilted. Doing a good form makes the dead bugs significantly harder.

Now i suggest everyone with weak abs to do a lot of dead bugs. It is probably the best exercise for people with weak abs."

Just a 'Thank You' (and some feedback): The RR is the best thing ever!,user23187425,664,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gzlvr3/just_a_thank_you_and_some_feedback_the_rr_is_the/,1591704526.0,"TL;DR: I've been working on my fitness for the last 10 years (on and off), and i've found the RR (EDIT: RR = ""recommended routine"", it's in the sidebar) to be the greatest single thing ever! And it even improved with the new routine. Thank you so much, /r/bodyweightfitness!

My background: Desktop worker (research, actually), no sports until i came down with severe depression at the age of 38 in 2010. Got into sports in 2011, although it's been a constant on/off-thing. When i started, my body was a wreck. I was overweight, my spine was crooked and i wasn't able to do a single pull-up.

 In these 10 years i tried/practiced: walking, running, swimming, Wing Chun, Escrima, Chi Gong, a little Tai Chi, a little Yoga, dumbbell routines, crossfit (where i learned barbell and olympic lifting, we had an ex-olympian lifting coach in our box), HIIT-routines, stretching routines and some other minor experiments.

I first started with the RR in 2015, and it immediately help me correct imbalances i had build up with other routines. (I'm very much self-taught in workouts since i placed major emphasis on independence from the very beginning.) From the beginning, i loved the clean structure of it and that you have progressions for everything. While not really emphasized, the RR requires more attention for your own body than many other approaches, and that is another great thing about it, it's the gentle way to strength.

I picked up running (again) quite seriously in 2018 and stopped all strength work for that. Now, i'm finally at a point where I'm back on the RR, in addition to running. (Alternating days.) I'm somewhere in my fifth consistent week (at least 2 but mostly 3 workouts per week) and while on sunday i was wondering if it was time to deload, i had the greatest, most satisfying workout yesterday and made huge progress.

From that perspective, i think i'm in a good position to compare the old and new RR. The old one was great, the new one is even better! For me, it's a very good thing that skill work is taken out, since i have to establish the basics firmly, first. I'd love to learn handstands and stuff some day, but I'm still working on setting up good form with banded nordic curls. Also, the new warm-up is a lot easier and the core-work seems to be in a better place at the end of the workout, at least for me. Now, i can get to the ""big"" excercises like squats and pull-ups quickly, and once i've done that, the rest is much easier since i know i'm through ""the worst"" already.

I do like my pistols, though, and stick to them for now. I tried shrimps but they are still difficult for me. In the process, i noted that i can only work on one challenging excercise at a time in order to maintain a tight workout. That means: Once i'm really comfortable with my banded nordics, i will give them another try.

I think what i appreciate the most about the RR is your mindful approach. More than with other things (except for chinese martial arts), the RR has taught me to listen to my body. That is absolutely crucial for anybody coming from a rehab perspective, i believe.

The RR has, over the years, also proven to be extremely reliable: It's relatively easy to get into it and results in terms of improvement of well-being are quick and reliable. Overall, while i will continue experimenting with sports in general, it has become the cornerstone of my quest to take care of my physical self. It also sets the bar for everything else i try.

So: Thank you so much! Your work has had a profound impact on me!

You may ask yourself, ""Didn't this person write a post about how sandbags are more well-rounded than kettlebells a few months ago?"" Yes, I did. However, I have recently become ~~obsessed~~ a big fan of kettlebell training, and experienced the unexpected benefits and carryover to my calisthenics training. I believe that while the kettlebell is a bit more specialized compared to a sandbag, its unique benefits are very compatible with the needs of a calisthenics athlete. They are also a tool that I have found to be the most convenient and versatile to train with of the ""Big Three"" free weight options (barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells). 

Before going into detail about why I believe the kettlebell is a great asset for a calisthenics athletes, I'll show a few quick examples of people training with a blend of bodyweight and kettlebell exercises.  My point with these examples is to show that the synergy of kettlebells and calisthenics has already been recognized and used to great effect.  They are a tool that can be seamlessly integrated into a bodyweight workout.

[https://www.cavemantraining.com/caveman-kettlebells/list-kettlebell-exercises/](https://www.cavemantraining.com/caveman-kettlebells/list-kettlebell-exercises/) 

This is a great resource for a huge number of kettlebell exercises and variations. Not all exercises are covered, but this is the best starting point I have found. 

# Benefits of Kettlebells for Calisthenics

1. **Strength & Hypertrophy**
   1. Compound Movements
      1. Kettlebells can address gaps left behind in calisthenics training, such as the hip hinge, squat, and row. 
   2. Isolation Movements
      1. Kettlebells can be used for isolation movements, similar to how a dumbell is used. There are even specific kettlebell isolation exercises that take advantage of the shape of the kettlebell. Example: [https://youtu.be/AED9Mf0KCEI](https://youtu.be/AED9Mf0KCEI) 
   3. Grip & Core Strength 
      1. Most kettlebell exercises will stimulate your grip and core, which has immediate carryover to your bodyweight training. 
2. **Explosive Power & Endurance**
   1. Kettlebell ballistic movements such as the snatch, clean & jerk, and swing allow you to develop explosive power while also training for muscular endurance and improving your cardiovascular fitness. The same exercise can be programmed to develop either quality, or a blend of both, depending on volume and intensity. 
3. **Stability & Mobility** 
   1. Many kettlebell exercises have a large stability component, training the muscles of your hips, core, shoulders, and wrists to safely handle unstable loads. 
   2. Kettlebell exercises also often have a large range of motion, helping you to become more strong and mobile. 
4. **Convenience & Portability** 
   1. Kettlebells are space-efficient and easily portable. You can store them in a closet, corner of a room, or underneath a bed.  Like gymnastic rings and bands, kettlebells can also easily be packed into a car and taken on road-trips, to outdoor locations, etc. They can be secured using a standard seatbelt to prevent them from moving around; [https://youtu.be/rRfn2Uql4\_k](https://youtu.be/rRfn2Uql4_k) 
   2. You also only need a few different weights of kettlebells (2-3) to reap the full benefits, unlike barbells that need many plates and dumbbells that come in small weight increments. This means you can have a fairly cost-effective setup compared to barbells or dumbbells, plus you do not need to invest in racks or storage equipment that can add additional cost and take up more space.

# Categorizing Kettlebell Exercises 

Kettlebells are often broken down into what is called ballistics and grinds. Ballistics are explosive, momentum-based movements such as the kettlebell swing, snatch, or clean & jerk. Grinds are everything else, including exercises like the goblet squat or turkish get up. I think the category of grinds is too broad to be useful, as the exercises included can be very different. 

Instead, I break kettlebell exercises down into 4 general categories, with several common examples listed for each. 

* **Ballistics**
   * Explosive movements using momentum. Either trained for low reps (focus on explosive strength) or moderate to high reps (focus on endurance). Single kettlebell variations are easier than double kettlebell variations. 
   * Beginner
      * Kettlebell Swing: [https://youtu.be/1cVT3ee9mgU](https://youtu.be/1cVT3ee9mgU) 
   * Intermediate
      * Kettlebell Clean: [https://youtu.be/C0B1SrcGAIA](https://youtu.be/C0B1SrcGAIA)
      * Kettlebell High Pull: [https://youtu.be/OkLpueSAKrY](https://youtu.be/OkLpueSAKrY) 
      * Kettlebell Half Snatch: [https://youtu.be/iVaFwCBP1GM](https://youtu.be/iVaFwCBP1GM)
   * Advanced 
      * Kettlebell Jerk: [https://youtu.be/GO50lAyPsVw](https://youtu.be/GO50lAyPsVw) 
      * Kettlebell Long Cycle (Clean and Jerk): [https://youtu.be/Jee68mMes2Q](https://youtu.be/Jee68mMes2Q) 
      * Kettlebell Snatch: [https://youtu.be/6SvawOLVTbo](https://youtu.be/6SvawOLVTbo) 
* **High-Skill Exercises**
   * Exercises that require a high degree of mobility and coordination. Usually trained for low reps. 
   * Beginner 
      * Kettlebell Surrender: [https://youtube.com/shorts/bwiw0GS7jHU?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/bwiw0GS7jHU?feature=share) 
   * Intermediate
      * Turkish Get Up: [https://youtu.be/sgd8n917Zv0](https://youtu.be/sgd8n917Zv0) 
      * Windmill: [https://youtu.be/ITSmgn\_BQgY](https://youtu.be/ITSmgn_BQgY) 
   * Advanced 
      * Bent Press: [https://youtu.be/Rh9s2bmH7vU](https://youtu.be/Rh9s2bmH7vU) 
* **Loaded Carries**
   * Any dynamic exercise where you are carrying the load of a kettlebell over distance.
   * Kettlebells are often less heavy than other options for loaded carries like sandbags. Compensate for this by training unilateral variations and/or doing longer loaded carries (more time). Shortening rest time is another option. 
   * [https://youtu.be/LLCwJWE67aU](https://youtu.be/LLCwJWE67aU) 
* **Strength Exercises**
   * Typical strength training exercises you would see in any gym. Most dumbbell and barbell movements have kettlebell equivalents.
   * Compounds 
      * Chest Press (Horizontal Push): [https://youtu.be/dMePOH4yZlY](https://youtu.be/dMePOH4yZlY) 
      * Deadlift (Lower Body Pull): [https://youtu.be/LrF7rKAvAiE](https://youtu.be/LrF7rKAvAiE) 
      * Press (Vertical Push): [https://youtu.be/hsFhBGUlDVs](https://youtu.be/hsFhBGUlDVs) 
      * Pullover (Vertical Pull): [https://youtu.be/1D\_NuZ1\_wBA](https://youtu.be/1D_NuZ1_wBA) 
      * Row (Horizontal Pull) : [https://youtu.be/bZ4h1Bqw-to](https://youtu.be/bZ4h1Bqw-to) 
      * Squat (Lower Body Push): [https://youtu.be/eo3nmy5w1jM](https://youtu.be/eo3nmy5w1jM) 

# Optimizing Your Training

***Which size kettlebell is right for me?***

* **Guide to picking the right size**: [https://www.kettlebellkings.com/pages/what-size-kettlebell-should-i-buy#:\~:text=Whether%20you%20are%20new%20to,35%20lbs%20(16%20kg)](https://www.kettlebellkings.com/pages/what-size-kettlebell-should-i-buy#:~:text=Whether%20you%20are%20new%20to,35%20lbs%20(16%20kg)). 
* Unlike dumbbells, kettlebells tend to come in larger weight increments. Thankfully, the versatility of kettlebells means you can get away with only using 2-3 different sized kettlebells. Do not worry about getting too many, just get one that is a good size. 
   * Start with 1 kettlebell at a weight that you'd consider ""intermediate""and base other kettlebells off of that standard. This may change over time as you become stronger. 
   * I recommend testing out different weights of kettlebells at a gym or store before deciding which size to buy. It is not very easy to guess without any experience. 
* There are also some **adjustable kettlebell options**
   * Example: [https://www.bellsofsteel.us/all-products/conditioning/kettlebells/adjustable-kettlebell/](https://www.bellsofsteel.us/all-products/conditioning/kettlebells/adjustable-kettlebell/) 
   * This is an inexpensive way to have many different loading options, and load the kettlebell in smaller increments. 
   * There are magnetic micro-plates that can be attached to a kettlebell for loading in smaller increments. They are very easy to use, but not very cost-effective.  

***Which type of kettlebell?***

Kettlebells fall into 2 different broad types, *hard-style* and *competition*. Both are excellent and mostly interchangeable, they just have a few key differences.

**Hardstyle**

* **Pros**
   * Larger handles, making it easier to hold with two hands. This may be more comfortable for people with large hands and wrists. 
   * Well-designed for single kettlebell exercises, okay at double kettlebell exercises. If you are planning to train only using a single kettlebell, the hardstyle kettlebell is a bit more versatile.
   * Heavier maximum weight. Some hardstyle bells can exceed 90 kg (198 lbs).  So if you are extremely strong with kettlebells, hardstyle bells give you more options for heavy single bell exercises.  
* **Cons**
   * Size of kettlebells varies depending on the weight. Beyond a certain point, hardstyle kettlebells can become very bulky and unmanageable, depending on how large your body is. This is usually a problem only at higher weights like 32 kg+ (70 lbs+). 
   * The wider handle makes it easier to smack your forearms with certain ballistic exercises. It feels very unpleasant and can bruise your arms slightly. 

**Competition**

* **Pros**
   * Smaller handles, making it easier to hold with one hand. These are very well-designed for holding a kettlebell in the rack position and balistic exercises like cleans and snatches, as those are the kettlebell competition movements. 
   * Well-designed for double kettlebell exercises.
   * Small handles make it a bit harder to hold with two hands.  
   * Uniform size of kettlebells, regardless of the weight. This means no issues with kettlebells being too bulky at 32 kg+.
* **Cons** 
   * Smaller handles make it harder to hold with two hands, making it less versatile. 
   * Competition kettlebells only go up to 48 kg (106 lbs). Realistically, this is only a problem for athletes who are very strong. 

***Single or pair of kettlebells?*** 

Single kettlebell exercises are quite popular and effective. It is entirely possible to reap the benefits of kettlebells while only doing single kettlebell variations. However, pairs of dumbbells allow you to use much higher loads, and are far more stimulating. They are great for maximizing strength and hypertrophy with kettlebells.

I personally recommend getting a matching pair of moderate weight kettlebells rather than getting a really heavy single kettlebell. You will get more use out of a pair of 20 kg (44 lb) kettlebells than a single 40 kg (88 lb) kettlebell, for example. 

***Kettlebells of different weights?***

A helpful compromise if you have several kettlebells, but no matching pairs, is to train mixed grip and anyhow grip exercises (see below). 

***Using kettlebells if you're very strong?***

A rule of thumb for estimating how heavy your kettlebells need to be is by having each kettlebell be a third of the total weight of the barbell equivalent. Example: You can barbell front squat 150 kg (330 lbs), so with one kettlebell you can do a 48 kg (106 lb) goblet squat, or with a pair of kettlebells you can do a front rack squat with two 48 kg kettlebell (106 lbs each). 

If you are fairly advanced in strength, such as a person who can easily deadlift 200+ kg (440+ lbs), then you're going to need to make a few modifications to continue to be challenged. Luckily, you can often use more than one of these options at the same time. Training with double kettlebells is going to be necessary. 

* **Option 1: Exercise Variations with More Challenging Leverage**
   * Switch from training exercise variations that are very easy for you, such as a standard kettlebell  DL to a single leg DL . 
* **Option 2: Use of Bands and Weight Vests**
   * See below for an explanation on how to add load with weight vests and heavy bands. 
* **Option 3: Holding More than One Kettlebell Per Hand** 
   * If you have a strong grip and are able to hold them both comfortably, you can hold two kettlebells in one hand for extra load. 
   * Example: [https://youtu.be/OKyQGP7IDV4](https://youtu.be/OKyQGP7IDV4)

***Ways to grip the kettlebell?***

**Standard** 

* Goblet 
   * An easy grip close to your center of gravity. Cannot be loaded to one side.
* Suitcase
   * Good for working with heavy weights and/or pulling movements.  Can be loaded to one side.
* Rack
   * A more challenging way to hold the kettlebell than the goblet. Can be loaded to one side. 

**Situational** 

* Anyhow/Mixed Grip 
   * A mixed grip using two different positions. Useful if you have two kettlebells that are different weights. In most cases, put the heavier kettlebell at the bottom position.
   * [https://youtu.be/6Wxeurtw1yk](https://youtu.be/6Wxeurtw1yk) 
   * Mixed: [https://youtube.com/shorts/Y0kjkTkGPjk?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/Y0kjkTkGPjk?feature=share) 
* Bottoms Up 
   * The ""ball"" of the kettlebell is further away from you, making the exercise more challenging and harder to stabilize. 
* Behind The Head 
   * Useful for replicating rear-loaded movements, such as the back squat or good morning. 
* Overhead 
   * Good for training overhead stability and mobility.
* Shoulder 
   * A position similar to the rack position, but often easier. Similar to loading in a fireman's carry.

***How to combine kettlebells with other equipment?***

* **Resistance Bands:** [https://youtu.be/Z77pGde9GjM](https://youtu.be/Z77pGde9GjM) 
   * Resistance bands are very convenient and can be used to add intermediate load between different kettlebell sizes. They can also change resistance curves for an added challenge. 
   * Strong bands are great for making exercises like kettlebell deadlifts challenging enough to be comparable to barbell equivalents. If you're a very strong deadlifter and/or squatter, it may be more practical (and far cheaper) to invest in heavy bands than to try and acquire very heavy and bulky kettlebells. 
* **Weight Vests** 
   * Another way to add some extra load. Good for calisthenics kettlebell variations as well as lower body exercises like squats and burpees. These are more situational than resistance bands, but also allow you to keep your hands free. 
* **Dip Belt**
   * Kettlebells are great as an alternative to weight plates for adding load to dip belts.

* Kettlebell Jerks **or** Jumping Jacks **or** Jump Rope

**GPP Workout (Intermediate)** 

A quick ""bang for your buck""  workout that trains a little bit of everything. This introduces the high-skill movement of the Turkish Get Up, as well as complexes. I recommend training the second and third circuits as ladders. The goal is to complete this workout as quickly as possible, without form breakdown. Make rest times shorter to increase difficulty.  Complete 2-4 rounds.

* A kettlebell ""complex""  is when you go through all the exercises in one continuous circuit. They are a way to save time and add an additional challenge. They are also very fun!
* A kettlebell ""ladder"" is explained here: [https://kettlebellsworkouts.com/ladder-workouts/](https://kettlebellsworkouts.com/ladder-workouts/) 

Circuit 1  (Conditioning Focus) 

* Kettlebell Swings 
* Turkish Get Up

"How many strict, military style push-ups can the average person do?",Financial_Pool_9273,658,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/wtopmx/how_many_strict_military_style_pushups_can_the/,1661050315.0,"I used to think I could do a ton of push-ups, until I tried doing military push-ups.

I used to do my push-ups with a fairly wide grip, not the tucked in grip of the military push up, I wouldn’t really care too much about proper form as long as my push-ups didn’t look too bad, didn’t engage my back muscles or keep the corkscrew tension on my palms to ensure my arms aren’t flared out.

I used to do push-ups like this and could do about 60-70. 

But when I learned about military style-push-ups, I realised I can only do about 7 when stressing proper form, and I feel embarrassed. It’s almost like I never trained at all, the wide grip ones were so much easier.

My question is, how many strict, military style push-ups can the average person do?"
Shoulder Rolls (part of the RR) are a great way to mobilize and strengthen the muscles around the shoulders and shoulder blades. Here are some ADVANCED variations that will strengthen your shoulders even more and leave you feeling good!,Antranik,658,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5jdj2j/shoulder_rolls_part_of_the_rr_are_a_great_way_to/,1482244290.0,"**Prerequisite:** You should be able to perform the [""regular"" Shoulder Rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H01oGIS1C_g) with good form (full range and with elbows locked the entire time) before trying the variations below.

###Link to Advanced Shoulder Rolls Video: https://youtu.be/5lH9aDdGG-4

The new exercises are (cue):

* Shoulder Rolls in Reverse Tabletop
* One-Arm Shoulder Rolls in Tabletop
* One-Arm Shoulder Rolls in Downward Dog

These advanced variations effectively increase the load/intensity which help to increase your shoulder shoulder strength, stability and mobility. **The one arm variations can be quite helpful for strengthening up a weaker side (or at least discovering that one side is weaker).** These are purely bodyweight exercises that don't require any equipment. Throw them in your warm-up or cool down or anytime you feel like loosening up and feeling good.

Hope you like that!

**PS: Special Mention for Overcoming Gravity 2**

In the video I thank /u/eshlow for suggesting these variants and in return recommend people to check out the new edition of his book [""Overcoming Gravity 2""](https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/0990873854/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=GMMBHN3AF887XBQKN5MQ) cause a new edition has come out.

My Progress and Seeking Advice,kittykat243,662,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/99yend/my_progress_and_seeking_advice/,1535124819.0,"Okay so I have been doing bodyweight fitness now for roughly 6 months now. When I started my weight loss journey I was 285  lbs (129 kg, 20.3 stones). When I started bodyweight fitness I was around 180 lbs (81 kg, 12 stones). I am now 165-170 lbs (74 kg, 11 stones) (I'm fluctuating a lot which is annoying). I'm female, 26 and 5'5 (65 inches). When I first started I could maybe hold the poses for 10 seconds at most, I was completely unable to do a pull up, or a push up. This is the progress I've made so far. Does this look like good progress and would you recommend anything else I could do to help build up strength (Most support holds I can hold for 50 seconds except the hollow hold...at most 30 seconds.

* Squat is 5\*5 200 lbs (90 kg)
* Pull-ups (1x3, 1x2, 1x1), (1x2, 3x1), (1x2 ,3x1) I cant seem to do more than three pull ups in a row but I am trying usually 3 or 2 and repeated as shown
* Parallel Bar Support hold (45-60 seconds) I usually can only hold it 45 seconds before my arms want to give out
* Push ups (Male version or normal version) 3X8
* Plank (60 seconds)
* Side plank (30-40 seconds on each side)
* L-sit (feet on ground) roughly (15 seconds)
* Horizontal Rows (3x4)
* Handstand (Cant seem to get over 58 seconds) - Belly to wall

My biggest issue I am noticing is my limited core strength. I have wicked leg strength, but my core, and arm strength is pretty lacking (core in general is terrible)

How I benefited from mindfulness while working out,LesTerribles,655,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ejg80e/how_i_benefited_from_mindfulness_while_working_out/,1578062335.0,"Recently, I’ve begun doing mindfulness meditation regularly. The intent is to practice mindfulness as you go about the rest of your daily activities as well.

I was hitting mental and physical roadblocks while exercising. Working out was becoming more of a chore.

I decided to be mindful while exercising. Normally, my mind is full of chatter – criticisms about my form, conscious of people watching. It felt like my mind would burst if I focused on anything except moving my body. Even during rest, I would make inaccurate suggestions to improve my form and would try hard to visualize the right movement. My mind felt burdened. You can see why it was becoming an unpleasant chore.

**How mindfulness improved my workouts**

* By being aware of my body and being less focused on my mind, I easily spotted my form mistakes. [1]

* There were other improvements I was able to make too. I breathed fuller breaths by breathing into my diaphragm. I relaxed more, both mentally and physically in the rest between sets. I noticed the pain occurring due to wrong form. I quickly fixed my form by entering the exercise in a correct manner. [2]

* I could perform the dynamic exercise cues more smoothly. As my breath was in sync with my up and down motion in the exercises, my strength did not unnecessarily falter. 

* I realized one of the reasons why I was plateauing. [3] I could also recognize some stupid alterations I had made to my workout routine. [4]

* It does take longer to workout. But it is worth it. I feel great at the end of it. Earlier, I would be completely wiped out. 

**What you can do**

The quality of my workouts has improved as a result of mindfulness. I strongly suggest you to introduce mindfulness to training as well. Do not be deterred if you don’t see improvements right away. You will most likely be overwhelmed at first. You will be totally confused if you try to be mindful without doing mindfulness meditation separately; I recommend you don’t jump blindly into it.

To begin with, just have more body awareness during your next workout. Do you feel an imbalance when you’re at the top of a pushup? Does a joint feel strained? Is your body moving smoothly and generally in a line or is it shaky? These are some observations you could make.

The goal is to observe how you exercise and IS NOT to be hypercritical or paranoid about your form. 

Your workout will be gentler, deeper and more enjoyable as a result.

--------------------------------------------------------

[1] My entire form felt incorrect while doing beginner shrimp squats. It hurt at the point where the hip meets the femur. I noticed the issue which was that my hip muscles were contracted needlessly at the top. I released the hip muscles for the leg which is in the air. I hip-hinged instead of leaning ahead with my back. My tracking improved immensely too.

[2] My shoulder muscle hurt while doing arch hangs. It was because my shoulder and scapula were in a wrong position. I bent my knees a bit so my arms could be fully straight. I moved my hands along the bar at an equal distance from the center making my body symmetrical. That fixed the issue.

[3] It was because I had 4 forearm heavy exercises back to back. I switched to another progression for one of those exercises.

[4] In the Copenhagen planks. I thought that if I alternated which side I workout first in between sets, one side would get more rest. So was doing L-R, R-L, L-R across the three sets in that order. I was right – one side did get more rest, but the other side got less! Now I laugh at how stupid that was."
Exercises for improved posture,SleepyBoy-,658,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/73sv8d/exercises_for_improved_posture/,1506952172.0,"I've got a very forward-tipped position, so I began to consider doing some exercising. The polish version of the recommended routine says that doing the body-line drills will help me with that. However from the english version it is not so obvious whether it helps you maintain proper posture in general, or just for exercising. So I wanted to ask for clarification and maybe additional guidance of how to get to the goal of standing upright after not giving a damn for 23 years.


I'm not interested in the strength workout or rather I cannot do it, as my left neck bone (clavicle) has weakened ligaments (it just grew that way) so doc doesn't allow me to go all out if I don't want to risk my arm turning off. Because of that keep in mind that I won't be doing full routines and am going to be doing all exercises rather slowly, and I cannot do pull-ups. So when you give me recommendations mark what parts of it are absolutely essential so that I can tell whether a routine is adjustable for me or if I should skip it.

The science behind the warmup.,Deanosaurus88,659,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kumyur/the_science_behind_the_warmup/,1610312684.0,"After stumbling across The Mindful Movers’ recent [Instagram post ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ07C_xDK2w/?igshid=eo71azmgqwaf), where he claims that he hasn’t warmup up before working out in 2 years, and has done so with zero injuries, it made me wonder what the science actually says about warming up.

Is the ingrained belief that we **must** warmup before workouts just indoctrinated into us through hearsay and community word-of-mouth, or is there actually any science out there that supports the notion?

EDIT: u/MindfulMover may want to chime in on this ;-)

EDIT2: This thread has produced some really divided opinions on the subject of warming up. **LOTS** of anecdotal cases of people from both sides of the argument. Clearly if science had categorical proof of one or the other, you’d think we would all be closer to an agreement. But the fact that there just doesn’t seem to be any profound agreement makes me really unsure about which is better. **I guess the jury is still out on this one.**"
The Breathing Plank: Why It Matters and How To Do It,None,659,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cbncex/the_breathing_plank_why_it_matters_and_how_to_do/,1562797118.0,"#Key Points: What This Post Will Cover

* Advanced static bodyweight exercises require a rigid torso to stabilize and control the lower body.

* There are two ways to create torso rigidity, increasing intra-abdominal pressure (holding a deep breath) and increasing the strength of the abdominal muscles.

* Bodyweight static skills demand a torso that is strong but flexible so you can breathe while holding the position.  

* The breathing plank trains the abs, obliques, and transverse abdominis to be strong and flexible at the same time. Strength + flexibility = better bodyweight skills.


#Why Bracing Is Key To High Level Bodyweight Skills

First off, this is a lengthy explanation so if you just want to learn how to do the breathing plank just skip to the end. For those of you that want to know why they should do the breathing plank, you have been warned, read on. 

All advanced bodyweight static skills require a stable lower body. Handstands, front levers, back levers, human flags, and the planche all involve keeping a certain body line. Without stabilization you either can’t balance, like in a handstand, or you can’t keep your feet in line with the rest of you, like in a front or back lever. If you want to truly master high level bodyweight skills then you need good stabilization. 

So what creates stabilization? Imagine you’re trying to balance a metal rod on your hand, like the seals in the circus balance on their noses. You think to yourself “this isn’t that hard, maybe I should join the circus.” Now imagine trying to do the same thing with a really tall slinky. Every time you move your hand to balance the slinky responds differently than you expect. Before long the slinky comes crashing down and you realize you probably aren’t cut out for big top life.

The difference between a metal rod and a slinky comes down to rigidity. The rigidity of the metal makes it predictable and easy to correct. Force applied to one end of the rod leads to movement at the other end. The slinky isn’t rigid at all, applying force to one end might lead to movement or it might not. If we want to keep balance in a handstand, we should be more like the rod and less like the slinky. If we want to keep our body in a straight line during a front lever, we should be more like the rod and less like the slinky.

So where is the weak link? What part of our body is the most like the slinky? That would be the lower half of our torso, your abs, obliques, and lower back. The upper half of our torso has a large amount of bone, the spine, ribs, and scapula, that make it very rigid but not flexible. The lack of bone in our lower torso gives us flexibility but at the cost of rigidity. If we want to make our midsection rigid then we have to use our muscles fill our skeleton’s role.

###There Are Two Things That Create Rigidity, Abdominal Pressure and Muscular Strength.

The lower torso is like an empty soda can that is resisting being crushed. There are two things you can do to make the can stronger. First, pressurize the can. The pressure inside the can counteracts the crushing force. It’s a lot easier to crush an empty can than a full one. Second, make the walls of the can thicker. Adding thickness to the walls of the can makes the structure able to bear more weight without being pressurized. Like the can,  we can make our torsos stronger either by filling them with air or by strengthening our abdominal muscles. 

We can increase pressure in the midsection by using the Valsalva maneuver. Take a deep belly breath then close your throat and exhale. To make sure you’re exhaling against your glottis and not your mouth, try doing the maneuver with your mouth open. Powerlifters use a combination of the Valsalva maneuver, the muscles in their abdomen, and a very sturdy belt worn around the midsection to make their torsos rigid enough to handle the weight they’re lifting. This works for the demands of powerlifting because the lift is short enough that they can hold their breath. 

But you, astute practitioner of bodyweight exercise, may have noticed a problem. Holding your breath and making your spine perfectly rigid works well for powerlifting but not well at all for bodyweight skills. Try doing a handstand or front lever without breathing, actually please don’t because you might hurt yourself. Holding high levels of pressure in the abdomen also makes it impossible to transition between positions. Good luck going from L sit to handstand all while exhaling against your glottis. 

Bodyweight skills demand less rigidity but require more flexibility and the ability to breath which means high levels of intraabdominal pressure aren’t what we’re looking for. If we want our midsections to stay rigid and flexible under load then we need to make the muscles stronger. Building strength in our abdominal muscles is actually pretty simple, place them under load and remove as much intraabdominal pressure as we can. Enter, the breathing plank.

#How To Make Your Abs Strong And Flexible: Breathing Planks

Full disclosure, these will wreck you. I’ve been practicing them for a little bit now and I still start shaking after 5 or 6 reps. I’ve also noticed that my front levers got noticeably better without direct training and I don’t shake as much during the last few seconds of the hold. My total body tension while climbing and running have noticeably improved as well. 

###Here is how to perform the breathing plank.

First, stand up and put your hands on your obliques, just above your hips. Take a deep breath, focus on filling your stomach and lower back with air. You should feel your midsection expand slightly. Once you’ve got your air force your hands apart by inflating your obliques and pushing out in all directions like in the Valsalva maneuver. That is the feeling you’re looking for on the inhale portion of the plank.

Get into a plank with whatever arm position you like. Push your feet into the floor to fully engage your abs, quads, and glutes. Take a deep breath, imagine filling your torso with air from the bottom up. Push your obliques out just like you did a second ago and hold it for a second. After you’ve held the air for a second exhale as much as you can, then exhale a little more. You should feel your abs tighten all around your midsection and possibly start shaking. Hold it for a second, then inhale again and repeat. Inhale, hold, exhale, hold is all 1 rep.  

You have now done a breathing plank. This exercise strengthens your transverse abdominis (TVA for short), a muscle that stretches around your midsection like a corset. If you’ve ever spent a night laughing with friends and woken up with sore abs the next day, congrats, you worked your TVA. The TVA doesn’t get worked by many exercises but the breathing plank hits them hard. It also works your rectus abdominis just like a normal plank. 

#Progressions:

###Here are variations of the breathing plank listed from easiest to hardest:

1. Breathing plank in pushup position with hands elevated (like on a table or chair)

2. Breathing plank in pushup position 

3. Breathing plank on elbows with hands under face 

4. Breathing plank on elbows with elbows under face 

5. Breathing plank with hands fully extended overhead

Each rep should take between 5-10 seconds so aim for 5 reps. If you can do 5 reps without shaking then feel free to move on to the next progression. Unless you plan on holding your static skills for longer than 50 seconds I don’t see much benefit for training the breathing plank for more than 5 reps, the extra endurance you build just isn’t that useful. We want maximal stability within the 25 to 50 second range so progressing the difficulty makes more sense than progressing the duration. 

#Conclusion:

That’s all folks. You now know why breathing and bracing matters for bodyweight skills, how to create it with abdominal pressure and abdominal strength, and how to use the breathing plank to improve your core stability and strength. Let me know if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to answer them!"

In-Depth Explanation of at Home Pull Up Bar Types,DoomGoober,651,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fnsukz/indepth_explanation_of_at_home_pull_up_bar_types/,1585000514.0,"There is a surge in interest for at home pull-up bars. I'm going to give an explanation of the physics, engineering, and experience (if I have any) of these different types of bars. For easy viewing, I have created a public Amazon Wish List. I'm NOT endorsing the brand or specific item linked in Amazon. I ONLY CHOSE THESE SPECIFIC ITEMS/BRANDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD PICTURES. These are only examples.

[The Bar Types](http://a.co/fJt36wH)

Starting upper left, going left to right:

1. **Cantilever Type Bar**. (Perfect Fitness on Amazon List) These bars use your body weight to wedge the bar into the door frame. The round rubber part presses into the door frame from one direction while the black plastic square pushes into the wall above the door in the other direction. Add your weight and the wedging becomes very secure. People falsely believe these bars are using the molding (the decorative trim around the door) to hold your weight, but this is false. The molding holds the bar in place only when you aren't on the bar. Pros: These bars are fast to put up and take down and require no screws into the door frame. Cons: Will not work if your walls and molding are very thick, your doorway is too wide, or your doorway does not have enough clearance to the side (including if the door cannot open all the way e.g. small bathroom.) The round rubber part occasionally dents the door frame. The black plastic part can leave a mark or rub the dry wall. The bar can fall off pretty easily if there's no weight on it. It can also fall off while you are getting on or off the bar or if you do an explosive pull-up (remember, your weight is what keeps it wedged! Doing an explosive pull-up and your weight will temporarily lift off the bar at the apex.) Height of bar cannot be adjusted and may be too low for average height people (you may have to bend knees!) My take: These are the most common bars since they are easy to install and relatively secure as long as you are smart about it.
2. **Cantilever Type Bar with Frame Clamps** (Gym1 on Amazon List) This is just a basic cantilever bar... except there are extra clamps which screw tight so padded feet push on the door frame and hold the bar in place when there is nobody hanging from it. This makes the bar more secure when there's no weight on it. Pros: Very stable. Don't have to screw into your door frame. Cons: You can no longer easily take the bar off compared to basic cantilever. My Take: A good, pricey variant of the cantilever bar. Removes weakness of cantilever design when there's no weight on it.
3. **Round Telescoping Bar with Screw in Mount** (Garren Fitness on Amazon List) There are two pipes, one with a slightly larger diameter than the other. The smaller pipe can slide within the larger pipe to adjust the span to different door widths (and to mount the bar). A screw through the large pipe, when tightened, holds the pipes in the same relative position. The mounts are screwed into the door frame. They are just short pipes with one end on them but larger in diameter. Expand the bar into the mounts, screw the tightening screw to hold the bar at the correct span. Pros: Screwed mounts with small profile (most doors can close with mounts installed.) Cons: The round bar in the round mount can rotate. The single point of failure is the screw system that holds the bar at the correct width. If this loosens, the bar span can decrease and the bar can fall. My Take: I would not choose this system. The single point of failure tightening screw doesn't sit well with me and the spinning bar is just silly (why not make it the interface between bar and mount a rectangle?)
4. **Hexagonal Telescoping Bar with Screw in Mount** (Yogabody on Amazon List) The mounts are screwed into the door frame. The mounts are like slots so if you looked at a cross section it would be: door frame, mount, bar metal, mount. This means the mount is doing most of the work to hold the bar both up in the air and at the correct width. This means the telescoping bars don't have a screw to hold them at the right width. Additionally, the shape of the bar where it interfaces with the mount is a hexagon. The hexagon fits in the rectangular mount such that it cannot rotate, meaning the bar can't spin. Also most models have gravity tabs that keep the bar from accidentally leaving the mounts upwards. Pros: Very secure. Cons: The mounts are wider than the round telescoping bar mounts, so they may block the door from closing all the way if you have thin depth doorframes. Sometimes makes a slightly rattling sound (as the bar shakes the mounts and rattles the gravity tabs.) My Take: A good choice if you're OK screwing into your doorframes (and OK with your door not closing all the way.)
5. **Ceiling Mounted Pull Up Bar** (Gronk Fitness on Amazon List) Mounted to the ceiling. That's it. The bar just hangs there. Pros: Very simple in concept. Cons: Screws are weakest when something is pulling in the same direction they are screwed and that's the case with this bar type. You must find strong ceiling beams to screw these to. The height of the bar also cannot be chosen. Your ceiling height dictates the height of the bar. My Take: I don't like the idea of drilling into the ceiling nor having screws being pulled out.
6. **Wall Mounted Pull Up Bar** (Econtric on Amazon List) Mounted to the wall. That's it. Pros: Very simple concept. Can be set to pretty much any height all the way up the ceiling. Cons: You must find studs to attach these to. Your studs have to be standard width apart (most modern houses use standard width). You may kick the wall when doing pull-ups. My Take: I don't like kicking the wall.
7. **Wall Mounted Above Door Pull Up Bar** (Black Marlin on Amazon List) Identical to other wall mounted bars, but closer to the wall but with a smaller footprint. This lets you put the bar above a door, which means the bar can be closer to the wall since your body will be in the open doorway. Pros: Very secure. Mostly out of the way for every day use of the door. Allows for highest mounting of all the doorway bars. Cons: You must have enough clearance between the top of the door and the ceiling. You may hit your head on the ceiling if you pull too high (or your ceiling is too low). Your doorway has to be pretty standard width for the studs to be the right distance apart. You have to screw into the walls. Height cannot be adjusted, your doorway height dictates height of bar. My take: These are an awesome choice IF your doorways and ceilings are the right height.

8&9. **Free Standing Station** (Weider and Cap Barbell on Amazon List) These use their large bases to keep from falling over. Pros: Each comes with a second use (dip station or squat rack.) Cons: Expensive. Heavy. Takes up a lot of room. Not totally stable (They rock slightly. Not enough to fall over but enough to make you feel a little scared.) My take: If you need the second function, these bars are not bad. In general, they are less convenient than doorway or building mounted solutions.

10. **Self Expanding Pull-Up Bar** (Feierdun on Amazon List) Two pipe system. You set the general bar width using a bicycle style quick release latch. The system uses a hinge to convert your vertical body weight into a horizontal force to push some rubberized feet outwards which wedges the bar into the door frame. Pros: Easy to change height on the fly. Cons: It's a friction system! The friction from the rubber feet is key (as is the friction from the door frame.) Explosive pull-ups may dislodge this system as the normal force from friction comes from your weight on the bar. My Take: This is a new system that is unproven. I'm wary of the concept as friction is a fickle beast.

**Last Comments:**

For a temporary (or even permanent) solution, **Cantilever Bars** are the best. Easy to install and stable if you get on and off of them slowly.

For a permanent solution, **Wall Mounted Above Door** is awesome but requires your building have the right specs. **Hexagonal Telescoping Bar with Screw in Mount** works in almost all doorways and is a good secure, permanent solution.

Let me know if there are any different bar types worth mentioning here. Please note, gymnastic rings can be used in place of bars for pull-ups. Rings have different mounting choices than bars."

This is what happened when I tried to workout at a PUBLIC playground,LAGman91,655,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mgbab3/this_is_what_happened_when_i_tried_to_workout_at/,1617093129.0,"Hello everyone, in these troubling times as you know most gyms are closed, so people make do with what they have. Up until recently I was blessed to be allowed to use my gym's equipment in open space which worket perfectly, as I am a powerlifter without much need for variety. This however stopped as the government found it dangerous :( 

Regardless the fact that I powerlift, BW fitness holds a special place in my heart, so I tried to find a public workout place to work at until my pull up bar and gymnastic rings arrive. It went fine for the first 3 sessions, but at the fourth a parent latched at me because I told one of his children to be careful when running around as I do my pull ups. He accused me of harassing and potentially molesting them, of illegal trespassing in a PUBLIC playground because I am an adult (only SOME instruments have an age limitation as they are too small/fragile). He also mentioned that I was creeping out other parents there, that I should NEVER talk to minors and that he would call the police. 

I did pull ups at the swings attachment bar when no kids were using the swings, his kids were just running around them doing figure eights and I was inbetween both swings. 

I only left as I was unsure of the legalities of the situation, as to which I found out later I was NOT doing anything wrong afte talking to the local police and my aunt who is a Judge.

How do I avoid this stigma?

Marking rings as a way to get them even,armandrapi,651,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lepyjh/marking_rings_as_a_way_to_get_them_even/,1612716067.0," After digging deep in r/bodyweightfitness and a not so deep googling without finding anything similar, I would like to share just another way to level rings even and my thoughts after a week trying it.

 I've have been reading many ways to even rings, that works pretty fine from using a straight stick to using marked straps or marking them; and after a flash of inspiration at my job, I thought: why not to [mark the rings](https://imgur.com/a/JiUngMC) themselves? It is a good way to even them against each other without the need of an external reference and decided to give it a try.

To mark my rings I used [tape and a spirit level](https://imgur.com/a/RZqFHA6), but you can use a marker and any straight enough object can do the trick thought I think that it is optional, all you need is a [steady hand](https://imgur.com/a/wvB9bdt) taping the rings. After a week trying it, these are my thoughts:

-It works pretty well once you get the heights which you want to work out, in my particular case, It stopped my obsession of constantly adjusting the rings due to defective strap marking by maker, i don't mind the couple of millimeters of difference and now i know that the big difference i see between rings is just a perception thing, not a real one.

-The thinner the mark, the better, but so far it has worked pretty fine with the tape showed in the pictures, I still haven't decided if I want to use a marker and I don't think that make a notch with a hacksaw would be a wise idea.

-It is well suited for people who workout outside or move their rings around a lot, hang their rings on uneven places like a tree branch or slightly sloped beams, and for the ones who advance in progressions like rings ab rollouts. But for the ones who never move their rings and doesn't change height too much, i think it is more practical to mark or tape the straps to the preset heights.

I hope that this could useful for anyone reading this and I would like read of any other idea to even rings that has been useful."

Finally achieved my first Chin up!!!,Xandws,653,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/q4lw4o/finally_achieved_my_first_chin_up/,1633787974.0,"I had always been a chubby kid growing up. That chub soon turned into obesity as I entered my teens. I was sitting at a whopping 108kgs at the age of 15.

Around November 2019 I decided to change myself as I was unhappy with what I had become and wanted to better myself. Unfortunately due to my lack of knowledge on weight loss I took the wrong approach. I starved myself and did cardio everyday while ignoring resistance training. It did work but I ended up skinny at 78kgs at the age of 16. 

I had no clue what to do and i can’t access a gym where I live so around March this year I started with calisthenics. Till June I basically spun my wheel constantly changing routines. Till I found this sub.

I started the RR end of May. At first I couldn’t even hang from the bar for longer than 10 seconds. I slowly worked on it and focused on arch hangs for about a month until i achieved my first negative. I slowly built up on them for 2 months. Going for 3x6 of 5 second negatives to 3x7 10 second negatives. I could do negatives but I still couldn’t do a pull up. Yesterday I decided to check if I could do a chin up since they’re supposedly easier than pullups. I didn’t expect much but I found myself slowly going up the bar instead of stopping. I gave it my all and to my surprise my head was above the bar!!!! I was exhilarated but I couldn’t do another one. At the least this means I am not stalling and will achieve my first pull-up soon enough."

- Started at around 78kg (172 lbs) in April 2021, went up to 85kg in February 2022, got back down to around 78kg in July 2022 after cutting.
- Went with a ""holistic"" approach to calisthenics: strength, aesthetics, mobility, flexibility, general health, skills... All are important to me, which I am aware slows down my process in each one of these domains individually.
- Unlocked a few skills: muscle up (not strict yet), tuck planche, solid handstand, solid L-sit, half lay back lever, adv tuck front lever, one-leg dragon flag, elbow lever.
- Current max reps on the basics: 15 rings chin-ups, 25 push-ups, ~20 dips.
- Got a few injuries along the way:
  - ring finger strain (A2 pulley and/or lumbricals) that got me out of bouldering for 3 months
  - costochondritis during 3-4 months which made me stop training the back lever
  - light case of golfer's elbow in right arm, that I thankfully managed to keep under control by being very cautious
  - tweaky left shoulder that has been nagging me for years and still sometimes does, mostly on dips and rows (likely a rotator cuff weakness)
  - shoulder impingement (AC joint pain) probably due to too much pushing volume these last weeks
- My objectives for next summer:
  - Strength: +66% BW chin-up, +80% BW dip.
  - Skills: full back lever, handstand push-up, straddle press to handstand, strict bar MU, full dragonflag, V-sit.
  - Flexibility: improving pancake and pike for the straddle press to handstand and V-sit.
  - Hypertrophy: gaining 3-5 kg of lean muscle mass.
- My top 3 pieces of advice for beginners, whatever the goals are:
  - I know it's been said time and time again but it is just so true: **focus on the basics and be consistent**. Get good at regular pull-ups/chin-ups, push-ups, dips, rows, pike push-ups, L-sits, squats, don't add tons of accessory exercises to your program. Skills will follow and will be **much easier** to acquire once you have strong basics. I deem I do not have strong enough basics yet which is why I have not started specific work towards planche/front lever for example.
  - **Track your progress** with videos and/or photos and/or writing down your workouts. This is so important in order to have objective feedback on what you are doing, and it feels very rewarding to look back on your progress.
  - **Listen to your body**. This one may be hard to get right at the beginning, but once you have suffered a few injuries or bad experiences you start to understand what it means.

## The start: April 2021 - August 2021

I was not starting completely from zero: I had tried calisthenics during a few months when I was in high school around 2014-2015 (following the infamous ""méthode Lafay"" for those who heard about it), and had gotten decent results at that time (went from 2 to 8 max dips, gained a few kg of muscle) but eventually lost motivation because the workouts were too intense and I ended up **feeling nauseous and dizzy** at the end of every workout, to the point where I was often unable to complete them. It took me several years to get around that obstacle, but with hindsight I think my workouts were too intense and too close to failure given my level of conditioning at that time.

From 2018 onwards, I started picking up rock climbing/bouldering because a few of my friends were doing it, and that helped me build back a baseline of fitness, especially in terms of pulling strength. I would also do some push-ups or dips on chairs from time to time to maintain some pushing strength. During COVID, all climbing gyms closed so that's when I started doing home workouts a bit more regularly: during the first lockdown (Spring 2020), I would do bodyweight workouts (basics like pushups and pull-ups) ~2 times per week to maintain fitness for climbing, without tracking my workouts and always going by feel to avoid experiencing again those nauseous/dizzy feelings from highschool workouts. Although I did not gain significant strength or muscle during that period, it was at that time that **I really understood the concept of ""listening to one's body""** and thanks to this, bodyweight workouts became enjoyable again (which they were not in highschool).

From 2018 to 2021, I was mainly bouldering with a few bodyweight workouts sprinkled here and there when COVID forced climbing gyms to lockdown again. I got into yoga randomly at the beginning of 2021, practiced it pretty seriously for a month or two which allowed me to become a bit more mobile (I think that's when I learnt to touch my toes in a forward fold) and helped with back pain, but soon I found it boring and stopped.

I got **seriously into calisthenics at the end of April 2021**: I think I was already able to do ~7-8 pull-ups and ~12 dips at that time. I'm not even sure what exactly triggered the spark for calisthenics: maybe a mix of wanting to look good for the summer and seeing a few cool videos on YouTube (I think Eric Flag's channel is one of the first I discovered) or because one of my roommates was into it, I don't remember to be honest. In terms of skills, I had several objectives that I wanted to achieve by the summer: a freestanding handstand for at least a few seconds, the bar muscle-up, the L-sit and the elbow lever.

Until August 2021, I was not tracking my workout nor had I a structured training plan, I was just working out ""by feel"" and watching follow-alongs on YouTube (usually on Eric Flag's channel), bouldering ~2 times per week and practicing handstands a few times during the week. I did not make tremendous progress on my handstand (I even developed pretty severe wrist pain due to poor conditioning and too much volume at once) or muscle-up but it was a good way to ease back into calisthenics. Although I didn't achieve the other objectives, **I unlocked my first L-sit in June**.

## Becoming more serious: August 2021 - October 2021

At the beginning of August 2021, I decided to start tracking my workouts more seriously (writing sets, reps and rest times in a small notebook that I still use today) and to design my own program (instead of watching follow-alongs on YouTube). Obviously I made the mistake that every beginner makes: focusing on too many goals at once and wanting to add too many different exercises to a routine. So I designed a Push+Legs/Pull split with 7 different exercises in each session, with my main goals being elbow lever + hanstand in Push, and muscle-up + toes-to-bar in Pull. I quickly realized that I was doing too much too soon and that I needed to place the exercises I wanted to progress the most on at the beginning of my workouts, so I adapted my routine a bit (mainly removing stuff). The routine ended up being made of handstand drills with the wall, a few variations of push-ups (today I'd rather stick with just one variation per cycle), dips, a few variations of pull-ups (at least explosive pull-ups were a relevant variation for the MU), skin-the-cats, cossack squats and a few core drills (leg raises, L-sit, hollow body holds). With hindsight, that was still too much and I should have removed some more stuff. Nevertheless, I quickly unlocked the elbow lever in August and then managed to **unlock my first bar MU** at the beginning of September 2021 (no chicken-wing but with kipping) and **my first rings MU** (without having practiced it specifically) a few days after. See the training clips below for videos of those.

At the beginning of September 2021, I changed my routine again (I was starting to understand proper programming at that time) and opted for an Upper/Lower+skills split, with my goals being cleaning up my muscle-up, handstand and frogstand-to-handstand (this one I soon realized was an unrealistic goal at the time!). On my Upper days I would do explosive pull-ups, pike push-ups, chin-ups, dips, bodyweight rows and push-ups; on my Lower days (usually at the end of my bouldering sessions) I would practice handstands, L-sit, archer squats, hollow body holds. Of course this routine evolved a bit with some trial-and-error, but it was better than my previous one. Progress was pretty steady and linear during that time, nothing crazy: in a month and a half, my chin-ups went from 6/6/4/4 to 6/6/6/7 (with only 1mn of rest between sets, which was too low in hindsight) and my dips from 6/6/5/5 to 7/8/8/8, while improving form. I also started seeing some gains on my handstand balance, after having spent most of the summer working on form with the wall: I think this is when I got my first freestanding 10s holds. Last but not least, I began to take flexibility more seriously around that time, got my palms-to-floor pike and made some progress on my middle split.

## Starting lever training: November 2021 - December 2021

In November I switched up my program and decided to start working towards the back lever, chest-to-bar pull-ups and the dragonflag. I kept my Upper/Lower split but adapted the exercises to fit those goals, and for the legs I went from cossack squats to shrimp squat progressions. In those 2 months I got from barely holding a tuck back lever for 5 seconds to a decent 15s advanced tuck back lever, and unlocked my first controlled chest-to-bar pull-ups. I also got from a bad tuck dragonflag to advanced tuck dragonflag. I did not progress significantly in my overhead pressing though, because pike push-ups were not prioritized enough in my program. My handstand kept getting better: this is when I really fell in love with handbalancing practice, and with my wrist pain issues finally out of the way thanks to months of proper conditioning I could practice it more often.

## Weighted calisthenics and dirty bulk: January 2022 - April 2022

In January I started a new cycle: my skill goals were still the back lever and dragonflag, but I decided to focus more on raw strength via weighted chin-ups, weighted dips and pike push-ups (overhead pressing being my biggest weakness IMO). I also decided I wanted to put on some mass after not seeing my weight move in the past 8 months and started dirty bulking: spoiler alert, it didn't work. I tested my max at the beginning of January to see where I was at: +27kg chin-up (~+33% BW), +20kg pull-up, +31kg dip.

Around the same time I also got injured while bouldering and strained my ring finger. I stopped bouldering for a full month but did not implement a proper rehab protocol in the meanwhile: as a consequence, 2 weeks after I got back into climbing (although I was taking it easy knowing that I was still injured) I re-injured my finger in the exact same spot. I was seeing a PT at this time (mainly for my left shoulder which had been nagging me for years), but he was not knowledgeable on climbing-specific injuries so he couldn't help me with that. This time I took 6 weeks off climbing and implemented a proper rehab protocol in the meantime (basically loading the injured finger progressively with free weights, inspired by https://www.hoopersbeta.com/library/a2-pulley-manual-for-climbers and https://stevenlow.org/rehabbing-injured-pulleys-my-experience-with-rehabbing-two-a2-pulley-issues/), and this time it worked perfectly and my injury was soon completely healed. I also got COVID during that period, which impacted my training during ~1 week.

Just as I had recovered from my finger injury and had made good progress on my weighted chin-ups (4x5 at +10kg, 1RM at +33kg), I started feeling mild pain in my medial epicondyle, which I suspected was the start of a golfer's elbow due to too much pulling volume as I had just started climbing again with enthusiasm. I stopped chin-ups altogether for a few weeks (keeping just the bodyweight rows), then slowly reimplemented negative chin-ups and then finally regular chin-ups, but didn't go back to weighted: this cautious and gradual approach seems to have worked well because the golfer's elbow has not bothered me again since then.

Regarding pushing strength, I unlocked my very first half lay back lever holds at that time, and made some good progress on weighted dips (4x7 at +5kg). However, I started to feel pain in my sternum when doing these exercises: after a bit of research online I realized that this was likely costochondrits, which seems to be extremely common in people who do dips and/or back lever training. This led to me stopping to train for the back lever, and regressing back to bodyweight dips for a few months before going back to weighted.

The bulk was not a success: I got up to ~85 kg at my maximum in February, but judging by the pictures (see the bulk vs. cut photo comparison in the next section) most of it was fat. I decided to start eating less (without weighing myself or doing a proper cut yet) which brought me down to ~83 kg at the start of April.

A few training clips from that time:
https://imgur.com/a/QvCC5At


## Back to basics and cutting: April 2022 - July 2022 (present)

The injuries (golfer's elbow and costochondritis) forced me to regress to bodyweight variations of the exercises, which I took as an opportunity to improve my basics and condition my body better before going back to strength-focused cycles. I also realized that my unweighted chin-up numbers had not really improved since October 2021: I could not do better than my 6/6/6/7 with 1mn rest between sets that I had done 6 months before. My overhead pressing was also still lacking a bit compared to the other movement patterns, so I decided to make it my top priority during a few months, in order to make some progress in my handstand push-up journey. Therefore my Upper program was really simple: pike push ups (4 sets, 5-8 rep range, 2mn30 between sets), chin-ups (4 sets, 1mn30 between sets), dips and bodyweight rows as secondary exercises + some bodyweight push-ups as a finisher at the end of the workout. I also decided to start doing a proper cut in April, with the goal of getting back down to 78kg in June: I bought a scale and started paying more attention to my macros and calories, as well as implementing intermittent fasting.

Regarding handstand training, I decided to focus more on kick-ups since it's something I had neglected until then, and made some good progress: I went from ~33% success rate in March to ~75% in July when warmed up and focused, but I still have a hard time kicking up consistenly especially when not warmed up or ""mentally prepared"" (e.g. if someone at a party asks me out of the blue to do a handstand, I am not confident that I can kick-up into it). I have also been practicing shapes (tuck, straddle, diamond) and some drills towards the press to handstand in the last months, making some progress there as well (I even got a tuck planche for free by practicing tuck press negatives!).

I definitely made some good progress on the basics: I hit 4x8 chin-ups recently (mid-July) which was a goal of mine for a long time, brought my dips to 3x10 unweighted then 3x10 with +5kg, and made some good progress on my pike push-ups (4x8 in an L-shape on the floor, I'll soon start elevating the feet). My lower body and core strength have also improved, although not super quickly as I only do 1 Lower session per week: I can do 3x8 full shrimp squats, and 4x5 135° tuck (half way between advanced tuck and half-lay) dragonflag reps.

Regarding the cut, I eventually reached my goal of 78kg not in June but in July. Nonetheless, I am very pleased with the result and the fact that I managed to stay consistent and stick to my initial plan, without ever starving myself. I did not notice any significant impact on my training or strength: I don't really feel stronger or weaker than before. Here is the before/after of my cut (April at 83kg vs July at 78kg): https://imgur.com/a/xDRUqXQ

## Flexibility

I didn't talk too much about flexibility since we're in r/bodyweightfitness and not in r/flexiblity, but as I said I took that subject rather seriously as well, doing some mobility work almost daily as part of my warm-up and then some intense flexibility work once or twice per week. Progress was rather linear with regards to the work I put in, with the exception of the pancake stretch: I have a hard time with this stretch in particular (my hips feel really stubborn), and I have probably spent too much time trying the pancake directly on the floor whereas I should have done more regressions instead (elevated pancake or seated on a chair), which resulted not only in slow progress but also frequent lower back pain due to too much spine flexion in the pancake.

## Conclusions and plans for the future

Overall I am pretty satisfied with the progress I've made this year, although my physique has not improved tremendously but that was expectable considering how different from a pure bodybuilding approach my journey was. Handstands have definitely become my favorite thing to practice although it was painful the first few months: my next big goal in that domain is unlocking the straddle press to handstand. Strength-wise and endurance-wise, I have made some decent progress but think I could have done better had I just focused on the basics from the start, and obviously the injuries (golfer's elbow and costochondritis) didn't help. Regarding skills, I have not achieved many and some goals I thought I would have ticked by now (back lever, dragonflag) are still underway, but I'm pretty confident I'll acquire those very soon since I'm close to the final progressions. Overall I do feel more fit, more mobile, stronger, and I tend to have less back pain than before (except when I go too hard on flexibilty work, especially the pancake has a tendency to destroy my lower back) although there may be a fair amount of placebo effect here.

This summer I plan on working out outside more and hope to finally get my full back lever as well as a cleaner bar muscle-up. During the next year, I'll keep making pike push-ups one of my top-priority exercises like I have for the past months, as I really want to unlock bent-arm presses and the handstand push-up. I plan to gain 3 to 5 kg of lean muscle mass (I won't make the mistake of dirty-bulking again) by next summer, which I believe is realistic as I am still fairly skinny. As an aside, I have started living on my own which will make it easier to keep my diet in check (I was living with roommates until now, and we were always eating together making it hard to stand to my own food choices). I can't wait to setup my ""home gym"" in my new apartment: I will invest in a squat rack and a barbell in order to add weighted squats and barbell RDLs to my Lower routine, among other stuff.

I am pondering upon starting a YouTube channel next year as well (obviously around calisthenics/mobility/handstands), most likely in French as I believe the French-speaking calisthenics YouTube game is still very open (as opposed to the English-speaking one which is almost saturated IMO), but this will require a lot of free time that I do not have at the moment, with work and life getting in the way. We'll see in a few months how it goes!"
(2 Years progress) The end of my journey with the RR,None,652,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/knejc4/2_years_progress_the_end_of_my_journey_with_the_rr/,1609374033.0,"Greetings everyone, I'm here to share my progress through the Recommended Routine and a bit of background to fully understand the journey I did. It all started on Agust, 2018 with a knee surgery, that kept me in bed for 2 months and almost 6 months doing rehab. I injured myself running, i was training (and aiming towards the Ironman) and I felt devastated because all my progress went away really quick, I went from 80kg to 70kg, and I was feeling very weak. When I was doing rehab I started to read about bodyweight trainings and ended up here, with the holy grail: The recommended routine. I was fascinated, as soon as I was able to train freely I started adjusting it for my level. 

At the 6 month milestone, I was already feeling strong again, not great but confidence came back. I pushed myself every time harder and harder. But then, I overloaded my hamstrings and ended up with tendonitis. Again, I had to readjust my plan and that's when I started reading ""Overcoming gravity"" and it gave me a new perspective. All the information i needed was there, and I made sure to learn everything I could.

At the 1 year milestone, I had a few months on and off because of the injury but I was still going strong, I got my first muscle up and a few more tricks that ill list below. I was feeling it, the ""calisthenic boy"" my training was hard and i kept making slow but steady progress. BUT THEN, freaking corona... my park was closed and I had little equipment at home, I did everything I could to keep my level, but 6 months went, and I was kinda stuck. Until the government cool off I started again.

2 years went by, and I think I could achieve more, but sometimes reality it's disapointing. I'm happy with my progress, I'm doing it because I have several health issues and keeping my body strong is the best way to fight it.

&#x200B;

These are my final stats:

Pull up progression: Archer pull ups 8x3, weighted pull up 20kg 8x3

Squat progression:  Pistol squat 8x3 (took me a full year because knee mobility)

Dip progression: Weighted L-dips 20kg 8x3, ring dips 8x3, HeSPU 8x3

Hinge progression: Simple legged deadlift 8x3 (yes, that bad)

Row progression: Weighted inverted rows 10kg 8x3, adv. tuck front lever 30s

Push up progression: Pseudo planche 8x3 hands at belly buttom

Core progression: Standing ab wheel rollout 8x3, 70° V-sit

My former PR was last summer, when I managed to get 8 reps. In the meantime I haven't really focused on increasing my reps on Ring MU. I did however implement them here and there in my workouts, which likely did improve my technique. Furthermore, the last couple of weeks I barely did any MU’s due to some pain in my elbow. I did however work a lot on increasing my reps on pull ups, in which I managed to get a new PR as well two days ago (21 reps). I wanted to see how increasing my pull up endurance would affect my muscle ups, it just goes to show that working and improving the basics can get you a long way.

4 years on Recommended Routine - in awe by it,shrimpset,651,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hpw4h1/4_years_on_recommended_routine_in_awe_by_it/,1594567545.0,"I've been doing the RR for some 4 years now (I've been a very long-time lurker and just recently finally made a reddit account). 

I haven't been doing the RR straight - maybe 6-8 months each year. I'd try another program, like Body by Rings or Antranik's hypertrophy program, or take time off due to an injury - but I'd always go back to the RR. 

After the first couple of months of doing the RR, I stopped doing the skin the cat & handstand progressions and the bodyline (core) exercises as my focus has been strength and hypertrophy. 

In late 2019, I discovered the updated RR, which doesn't have L-sits, so I stopped doing them altogether. I'd like to add that am male, months away from turning 40, and having had my share of injuries in my younger years, I focus strongly on longevity and go thru progressions slowly... after some 4 years, I was still on advanced tuck L-sit for 29"" for each set.

7 weeks ago, I decided to learn some skills so I got Calisthenic Movement's Complete Calisthenics (CC) program since it ""includes direct skill training."" The program has 5 levels and each level has a minimum requirement for how many reps/hold time are needed of 6 exercises. The pullups, dips, and pushups requirements for all the levels are no problem, but Level 3 and up have wall handstand, skin the cat, and L-sit requirements. I haven't trained them in years or achieved the full L-sit, so I started with level 2. It's pretty easy compared to the RR with only 4 exercises per day and a warm-up 3x a week, but I figure I can build up my wall handstand time.

Yesterday, I tested my wall handstand and held it for 42"". I realized I actually passed the handstand requirement for CC Level 4. I figured, why not see if I can meet the other requirements? Tried skin the cat, which I haven't trained in 3 years, and was able to do 5 reps with no momentum. I then tried the full L-sit, which I'd never tried and stopped with advanced tuck months ago, and held it for 17""!

I am in awe and beyond impressed by the RR. It had become quite routine (pun intended) and normal for me. I didn't think I'd get the wall handstand that quickly (7 weeks with 1x or 2x holding it per week) or be able to do the other two exercises - I didn't know my own strength at all... If I had never dropped those 3 exercises, I know I would've blown past the level 5 requirements. I hope the money spent on CC is worth the ""direct skill training.""

Anyway, the RR is really a great program. Good for years and years and, like it says, it really does give ""you a solid basis for most other things you might want to get into."""

"I researched the origins of calories, macros, and modern nutrition science - the history is fascinating and gave me a totally different perspective on health & food",bluediavolo,643,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/d9k9rq/i_researched_the_origins_of_calories_macros_and/,1569507576.0," I got curious about how and when concepts like Calories, macros etc. entered mainstream media and popular science. I was hoping to learn more about these topics from a historical perspective, to maybe gain a different point of view to how as society we have been viewing health and diet (it's also a professional interest, since I'm working on a workout app).

I found out a lot about about how the human body processes food, and how people have been thinking about food (it was about the money, it’s still kind of about the money). 

I was not aware that the so called Atwater factors system that's about a century old is still widely used on food labelling (it's complex but a basic assumption is the popular 4 Calories/gram carb/protein and 9 Calories/gram fat calculation). Or that to estimate the Calories in food, they actually burned a sample of the food in a sort of chamber - hence the expression of burning calories.

I read up quite a bit of historical studies, original documents from the end of the 19th century, and some recent research, and summarised it in a [(longish) write-up](https://blog.jumpycatapp.com/calorie-counting-weight-loss-history/). If you're interested in this topic, or know more than me, please comment.

TL;DR Counting calories is more complex than the numbers on food packages make it seem (though they do a pretty good job for most cases, if you do need to count calories). The human body is an incredible system, which we are still just beginning to understand.

Disclaimer: Not advocating for or against calorie counting, just wanted to bring out the complexity of how the human body interacts with food - I found it quite fascinating."

I followed the recommended Routine and got better continuously, 6 months back I could do 10 full ROM Pull-ups, 20 straight bar dips, 30 pushups. After gyms opened, I joined one and started doing weights and was making good progress until covid hit me. It has been 10 days now and I have still not recovered fully. Also, the gyms have closed down and I am planning on working out from home again. I just wanted to ask you how effective would be the above-mentioned exercises in building a good strong physique, if I eat and rest well, I am also going to add pistol squats and running for legs. Can I progress in strength if I program my routine well and stay consistent? Thanks."
"It's been nearly 12 months since i properly worked out, and I'm approx 30lbs heavier from my prime days - how best to amend the RR, or what is a anothetr approach?",_noclip,646,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/l3hw4f/its_been_nearly_12_months_since_i_properly_worked/,1611428083.0,"Background:

Mid-20's: period of heaviest ""big 3"" lifts e.g. DL of 430lbs at 179lbs BW, maintained for few years then dipped out to do calisthenics (picked up a dislocated clavicle, impingement in both hips during weightlifting period)

Late 20's: fewer times at the gym, massive period of depression (reoccurring, had from teens), PTSD emerged etc. Gained 16lbs over time.

Now: early 30's, further weight gain to 207lbs from lack of gym/pandemic/meds/worse diet.

I've messed around with calisthenics now for years with some periods of heightened progression e.g. did manage to achieve ring muscle ups, topped out my pistol squats at single rep+50lbs added weight, but am now back to what virtually feels like square one. I've trained from home in what essentially a space less than the size of a jail cell to save some money and time with work for the last 2 years, half-assed.

I recently bought my first house, which has a shoddy a.f. garage but two overhead beams which will hold me easily using Olympic rings. I also have my own sandbags, dip bars, bands, weight plates and whatnot.

Right now I'm on my first two sessions of the RR following from the warmup to the routine. Ring pullups, likely through a lack of consistent training and weight gain, top out about 3 or 4 reps a set albeit with my chin just about in line with the rings. Same with dips. Overall I woke up this morning like a bus had hit me from the workout, and reckon it may be 2-3 days before I attempt another full session.

I'm certainly not as strong as what I was, and am considerably heavier. Aside from strategies with better diet and supplemented cardio, is my position one where I take it slow and simply trust in the work, following linear progression principles where applicable, or do I need to revise my approach e.g. 6 days a week but half the routine each day?

I appreciate if you read this far and can leave constructive feedback. I hope others in a similar position gain insight from the answers as well."

They're well sourced research articles that give scientific based prescriptions.

I'll post the basic summaries with a bit of commentary, but they pretty much stand for themselves if you want to read them.

------------------------

Protein and exercise

> The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) provides an objective and critical review related to the intake of protein for healthy, exercising individuals. Based on the current available literature, the position of the Society is as follows:

>1. An acute exercise stimulus, particularly resistance exercise, and protein ingestion both stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and are synergistic when protein consumption occurs before or after resistance exercise.
 
>2. For building muscle mass and for maintaining muscle mass through a positive muscle protein balance, an overall daily protein intake in the range of 1.4–2.0 g protein/kg body weight/day (g/kg/d) is sufficient for most exercising individuals, a value that falls in line within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range published by the Institute of Medicine for protein.
 
>3. Higher protein intakes (2.3–3.1 g/kg/d) may be needed to maximize the retention of lean body mass in resistance-trained subjects during hypocaloric periods.
 
>4. There is novel evidence that suggests higher protein intakes (>3.0 g/kg/d) may have positive effects on body composition in resistance-trained individuals (i.e., promote loss of fat mass).
 
>5. Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 20–40 g.
 
>6. Acute protein doses should strive to contain 700–3000 mg of leucine and/or a higher relative leucine content, in addition to a balanced array of the essential amino acids (EAAs).

>7. These protein doses should ideally be evenly distributed, every 3–4 h, across the day.
 
>8. The optimal time period during which to ingest protein is likely a matter of individual tolerance, since benefits are derived from pre- or post-workout ingestion; however, the anabolic effect of exercise is long-lasting (at least 24 h), but likely diminishes with increasing time post-exercise.
 
>9. While it is possible for physically active individuals to obtain their daily protein requirements through the consumption of whole foods, supplementation is a practical way of ensuring intake of adequate protein quality and quantity, while minimizing caloric intake, particularly for athletes who typically complete high volumes of training.
 
>10. Rapidly digested proteins that contain high proportions of essential amino acids (EAAs) and adequate leucine, are most effective in stimulating MPS.
 
>11. Different types and quality of protein can affect amino acid bioavailability following protein supplementation.
 
>12. Athletes should consider focusing on whole food sources of protein that contain all of the EAAs (i.e., it is the EAAs that are required to stimulate MPS).
 
>13. Endurance athletes should focus on achieving adequate carbohydrate intake to promote optimal performance; the addition of protein may help to offset muscle damage and promote recovery.
 
>14. Pre-sleep casein protein intake (30–40 g) provides increases in overnight MPS and metabolic rate without influencing lipolysis.

**Note since there is some misunderstanding**: The protein recommendations are in g/kg which means that you need to divide by 2.2 to get g/lbs. This means that the recommendations above are generally within the more commonly known .7-1 g/lbs for athletic populations and 1-1.5+ g/lbs for resistance trained athletes who are cutting.

------------------------

>The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases the following position stand on a critical analysis of the literature regarding the effects of diet types (macronutrient composition; eating styles) and their influence on body composition. The ISSN has concluded the following. 

>1. There is a multitude of diet types and eating styles, whereby numerous subtypes fall under each major dietary archetype. 

>2.  All body composition assessment methods have strengths and limitations.

>3.  Diets primarily focused on fat loss are driven by a sustained caloric deficit. The higher the baseline body fat level, the more aggressively the caloric deficit may be imposed. Slower rates of weight loss can better preserve lean mass (LM) in leaner subjects. 

>4. Diets focused primarily on accruing LM are driven by a sustained caloric surplus to facilitate anabolic processes and support increasing resistance-training demands. The composition and magnitude of the surplus, as well as training status of the subjects can influence the nature of the gains. 

>5.  A wide range of dietary approaches (low-fat to low-carbohydrate/ketogenic, and all points between) can be similarly effective for improving body composition. 

>6.  Increasing dietary protein to levels significantly beyond current recommendations for athletic populations may result in improved body composition. Higher protein intakes (2.3–3.1 g/kg FFM) may be required to maximize muscle retention in lean, resistance-trained subjects under hypocaloric conditions. Emerging research on very high protein intakes (>3 g/kg) has demonstrated that the known thermic, satiating, and LM-preserving effects of dietary protein might be amplified in resistance-training subjects. 

>7.  The collective body of intermittent caloric restriction research demonstrates no significant advantage over daily caloric restriction for improving body composition. 

>8.  The long-term success of a diet depends upon compliance and suppression or circumvention of mitigating factors such as adaptive thermogenesis. 

>9. There is a paucity of research on women and older populations, as well as a wide range of untapped permutations of feeding frequency and macronutrient distribution at various energetic balances combined with training. Behavioral and lifestyle modification strategies are still poorly researched areas of weight management.

**Note since there is some misunderstanding**: The protein recommendations are in g/kg which means that you need to divide by 2.2 to get g/lbs. This means that the recommendations above are generally within the more commonly known .7-1 g/lbs for athletic populations and 1-1.5+ g/lbs for resistance trained athletes who are cutting.

>Creatine is one of the most popular nutritional ergogenic aids for athletes. Studies have consistently shown that creatine supplementation increases intramuscular creatine concentrations which may help explain the observed improvements in high intensity exercise performance leading to greater training adaptations. In addition to athletic and exercise improvement, research has shown that creatine supplementation may enhance post-exercise recovery, injury prevention, thermoregulation, rehabilitation, and concussion and/or spinal cord neuroprotection. Additionally, a number of clinical applications of creatine supplementation have been studied involving neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., muscular dystrophy, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease), diabetes, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, aging, brain and heart ischemia, adolescent depression, and pregnancy. These studies provide a large body of evidence that creatine can not only improve exercise performance, but can play a role in preventing and/or reducing the severity of injury, enhancing rehabilitation from injuries, and helping athletes tolerate heavy training loads. Additionally, researchers have identified a number of potentially beneficial clinical uses of creatine supplementation. These studies show that short and long-term supplementation (up to 30 g/day for 5 years) is safe and well-tolerated in healthy individuals and in a number of patient populations ranging from infants to the elderly. Moreover, significant health benefits may be provided by ensuring habitual low dietary creatine ingestion (e.g., 3 g/day) throughout the lifespan. The purpose of this review is to provide an update to the current literature regarding the role and safety of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine and to update the position stand of International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN).

> After reviewing the scientific and medical literature in this area, the International Society of Sports Nutrition concludes the following in terms of creatine supplementation as the official Position of the Society:

>1. Creatine monohydrate is the most effective ergogenic nutritional supplement currently available to athletes with the intent of increasing high-intensity exercise capacity and lean body mass during training.

>2. Creatine monohydrate supplementation is not only safe, but has been reported to have a number of therapeutic benefits in healthy and diseased populations ranging from infants to the elderly. There is no compelling scientific evidence that the short- or long-term use of creatine monohydrate (up to 30 g/day for 5 years) has any detrimental effects on otherwise healthy individuals or among clinical populations who may benefit from creatine supplementation.

>3. If proper precautions and supervision are provided, creatine monohydrate supplementation in children and adolescent athletes is acceptable and may provide a nutritional alternative with a favorable safety profile to potentially dangerous anabolic androgenic drugs. However, we recommend that creatine supplementation only be considered for use by younger athletes who: a.) are involved in serious/competitive supervised training; b.) are consuming a well-balanced and performance enhancing diet; c.) are knowledgeable about appropriate use of creatine; and d.) do not exceed recommended dosages.

>4. Label advisories on creatine products that caution against usage by those under 18 years old, while perhaps intended to insulate their manufacturers from legal liability, are likely unnecessary given the science supporting creatine’s safety, including in children and adolescents.

>5. At present, creatine monohydrate is the most extensively studied and clinically effective form of creatine for use in nutritional supplements in terms of muscle uptake and ability to increase high-intensity exercise capacity.

>6. The addition of carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein to a creatine supplement appears to increase muscular uptake of creatine, although the effect on performance measures may not be greater than using creatine monohydrate alone.

>7. The quickest method of increasing muscle creatine stores may be to consume ~0.3 g/kg/day of creatine monohydrate for 5–7-days followed by 3–5 g/day thereafter to maintain elevated stores. Initially, ingesting smaller amounts of creatine monohydrate (e.g., 3–5 g/day) will increase muscle creatine stores over a 3–4 week period, however, the initial performance effects of this method of supplementation are less supported.

>8. Clinical populations have been supplemented with high levels of creatine monohydrate (0.3 – 0.8 g/kg/day equivalent to 21–56 g/day for a 70 kg individual) for years with no clinically significant or serious adverse events.

>9. Further research is warranted to examine the potential medical benefits of creatine monohydrate and precursors like guanidinoacetic acid on sport, health and medicine.

Some of the conclusions are more well known than others. For example, there's a lot of basic conclusions that you need increased caloric intake to gain muscle and weight, and that you need less calories to lose weight. Some are less well known such as the fact that higher protein intakes (2.3-3.1 g/kg or about 1.1-1.5 g/lbs) can be useful for maintaining lean mass in resistance trained subjects under hypocaloric situations. Also the part about the satiety effects of protein for thermic and satiety effects in resistance trained subjects. Some like creatine's usefulness in injury prevention, thermoregulation, rehabilitation, and use in concussion and spinal cord neuroprotection you just wouldn't know unless you're a well informed medical professional. Still others take a stand on some of the conflicting literature like protein intake and mass gains. For example, the distribution of protein over the course of time versus daily intake.

I'm pretty happy with the range of subjects they covered and the depth that their research goes into.

Feel free to read each of them as they're all very long and detailed if you want to know more about these subjects. Obviously, they're important to bodyweight fitness as gaining strength, hypertrophy, and recovery for training depend heavily on nutrition. :)

PROGRESS POST: 3 YEARS OF CALISTHENICS AND POWERLIFTING,ilmattoh,641,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cvpq8p/progress_post_3_years_of_calisthenics_and/,1566834051.0,"Hello redditors,

after recently discussing of my progress on another thread and seeing how well it was received by other users, I decided to make an in-depth descripition of the last 3 years of my journey.

**Starting stats:**

\- 16 yo male

\- 180ish cm

\-74/75 kg of skinny fatness

\- no lifting background, only volleyball, swimming and tennis

**Current Stats:**

\- 19yo male

\- 181 cm

\- 82.5 kg (at 12/13 ish bf)

**My Story:**

I started working out in 2016's summer, with the goal of getting a better physique to be able to get more girls (sigh). Yeah, I was your basic 16 yo male with his 2 neurons clashing togheter. I knew nothing about working out and calisthenics was only popular among a few athletes in my country.

The first year I was surrounded by other guys, our training style was this basic split: push/pull with a bunch of skill thrown here and there. I can comfortably say that the first half year was basically wasted: it took me 2 months to get a pull up trying different methods, only later in my journey I'd figured the best way to get your first pull up. The good thing, tho, is that my friends and I created a small group where the members motivated each other to work out, everyone for his own reason. We even managed to host a small calisthenics tournament, but that is for another story.

Second year was the ""basics"" year. During that period, I got pissed of skill work  (and it wasn't even that much of a skill work, I was just really unexperienced and preferred investing in basics) I trained a lot of reps. Like 4 or 5 sessions a week, each with 800/900 reps, trying to imitate the resistance training style. Results came (developement + a lot of hypertrofy)  and I became bigger. But on the long run, the amount of reps and the intensity of the workout weakened my nervous system, so I had to rethink everything.

So the third year, the year of the revolution. Not only I started focusing more on dieting, but togheter with a friend of mine (who is trained by one of the best coaches in my country) I started modifying my program to make it better and better. More skillwork, less stupid-amounts-of-reps, more technique, started mixing powerlifting too and so on. I'll try to condensate most of what I know, but I think I'll resort to making small but informative videos on the channel I recently created. Trust me guys: there are a lot of big misconceptions about bw training and I want to help the people who weren't as lucky as me.

So here I am now, 3.5 years in, making this post hoping to help all the guys who are/were like me (gals too, eheh).

**Progress:**

\- Weighted pull up: 70 kg

\- Weighted dip: 85 kg

\- Military press strict: 87.5kg

\- Deadlift: last tried 180kg, don't know actual PR

\- FL: my best hold is a 4/5 half lay, I can also hold a full FL but i have high standards on skills (more on the tips down there)

\- Planche: still working on the tuck. I am on the heavy side (not an excuse tho!) and planche is my achille's heel.

\- Full ROM hspu: don't know the actual PR, last time it was 8 but now I can easily perform seven.

\- Muscle ups: currently training them with 60cm obstacle, before transitioning to weighted.

\- Bench Press and Squat: PR is currently unkown

\- OAP: in progress

**WIL: workout tips**

General:

\-Weight is not an excuse, it's a factor to take into account when planning your routine. Avoiding certain stuff until ready and progress slowly, don't get frustrated too soon and enjoy the ride. It's going to take time, but it'll be worth.

\- Basics are important. Don't even think of training FL and planche before being able to do HSPUs, Dips and Pull ups easily. Too soon people progress slowly on skills because they have the strenght to the starting movements (i.e. tuck) but the total amount of skillwork won't make up for the necessary strenght. (Exceptions are possible, but you get the point).  A good starting point is 18/20 pull ups, 25/30 dips, 12/13 hspu on the wall (with half rom). Sound like a lot,  right? Well, it is. Skills are for non beginners trainees, even the easy progressions, and I can say that this method works pretty well after trying it on a few friends.

\- Use weighted training to account for your initial lack of strenght. Hard time doing pull ups? Pair negatives with partial ROMs and barbell rows mixed with deadlifts. It will do wonders for your strenght. Hard times with your first wall hspu? Strict Military press is your friend! The list goes on, but the basic idea is: if you can't do it bw, it doesn't mean you have to neglect it until you can do it.

\- Be nitpicky with skills. Little bending? Bad. Shaking a bit? Bad. Not completely in line? Bad. There is a range of tolerance, but most of the times bad form in skills is due to not having enough strenght. Easiest example is Straddle FL: many people raise their legs because of the hip mobility, except the reason is that they lack pulling strenght.  No amount of stretching will make your lats stronger. Skills are brutally honest, but the reward if you take them seriously is always worth it.

\- You don't need to hit the 85/90 % RM range in weighted stuff. Especially with bw movements, you need to touch these percentages only a few times during your peak weeks. Why? Your nervous system gets overloaded easily, and most of the times lower percentages with good technique will do wonders. I can't make a specific example, because it depends on your training history.

\- Do partial ROMs movements to reinforce your weak points. You know that no-rep pull up cause you only reach half of the movement? It's good for your starting motion.

\- Don't fear taking a week of total break. You will come back stronger and more motivated.

\- Go on youtube and learn about different training methods, rep schemes, and so on. Buy books. Don't stop learning.

**WIL: motivational tips**

\- Make the workout an habit. When motivation lacks, habit will kick in.

\- If you fall, get up slowly. One step at the time is better than big explosions of energy.

\- Surround yourself with people that could like working out. Not necessarily bw fitness, but the motivation that comes from having other people around will be what drives you when you feel down.

**WIL: dieting tips**

\- Get a calorie tracking app. Many are on the market, you can choose what you like best.

\- Don't use the calorie tracker ""standard"" recommendation. Mifflin St Jeor formula is my favourite when it comes to calculating the right amount of cals for you. Also learn to listen to your body. Feel tired even if you eat all the cals? Add more. Ate all the cals but feel too full? Eat less. Time will be your friend, as you get more and more experienced.

\-  A small treat everyday is better than destroying yourself every cheat meal or eating out of stress.

\- Sometimes you gotta eat as you want. I know this sound incoherent with the previous point, but it's not. Sometimes you need a break. A day, a week, even a mont of relax. Fine, take it. Don't stress it too much. By the time the ""cheat"" period ends, you will be more motivated to come back to dieting.

**Progress:**

This is the video I decided to make to tell you about the transformation my body and my mind went trough during the last three years.  It's puposely looking like an old-school transformation/motivational video, since it's because of them that I started my journey and I wanted to somewhat make a tribute to them. I hope it isn't against the rules of self promotion, cause it's more like a tribute than something else.

I tried to squeeze everything I know but I am already aware that it's not even 10% of what I can give to this community. I will probably post more stuff (tutorials, guides, etc) if the reception is good.

My ultimate goal is to motivate the bros of bwfitness, showing that if I made it from zero, everybody can!

The Russian Fighter Pull Up Program:

(Rep scheme is in video description. Tried to copy and paste it here as well, but could not get the formatting right to make it easily readable. Still learning reddit formating)




I think I first came across this in Pavel and Dan John's easy strength book and then further dug into it on various posts that they have both made on blogs/websites.


The program is simple, reps slowly climb week after week, which just sneaks added volume into your workout and at least my body seemed to react almost exactly in the way Pavel had claimed it would. Took me from about a max set of 7 pull ups to 14 in 30 days. Those gains have been maintained even since stopping following the program specifically and just using general maintenance/conditioning.


I have seen recommendations as to how to do this with weighted pull ups as well, but have not tried it. If someone has, I'd be curious how it went for you.


Additionally, you could use the same rep scheme that is outlined for weighted pull ups if you only have a max set of 3 or so reps and build from there. But this program is not designed to get you your FIRST pull up. It's definitely more targeted at just increasing the size of your max set."

The Secret Weapon to Tackling Your Goals: Volume,bananasdontscale,642,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bqnt55/the_secret_weapon_to_tackling_your_goals_volume/,1558309331.0,"Due to the recent surge in basic ""I've plateau'd, help"" posts on this board, I thought it'd be helpful to write up a not-quite-shallow not-quite-in-depth post about the secret tip that personal trainers don't want you to know -- *training volume*. This is going to be more of a thought-vomit than a structured and organized post, so bare with me.

# Dictating Volume

Before I start spouting about its magic plateau busting properties, it would be wise to make sure we're all on the same page about what training volume actually is. Simply put, ""Training Volume"" is how much work you're doing each day/week/month/whatever time frame you want, A.K.A ""Tonnage"". Calculating your volume is also simple, thanks to the miracle inventions of calculators. To find it you simple multiply your sets by your reps by your load by distance traveled for any given movement/muscle group.

**Distance Traveled** \-- Let's start here, since it's the easiest one. This is essentially how far you or the weight travels from the beginning of the movement to the end. In other words, it's your range of motion. Since you only care about your own individual training volume, then you don't even have to think about this factor because your range of motion should be consistent throughout. If your range of motion isn't consistent, you got some discipline issues to fix before worrying about your volume, pal.

&#x200B;

**Load** \-- This is your intensity. If you're doing any weighted movements, it's the extra weight you've added to your bar/belt. If you're doing unweighted gymnastics exercises, like a planche or front lever, then this factor isn't all that helpful because we can't be accurate in measuring it. Just know that a tuck is easier than a straddle and go off of that.

**Sets and Reps** \-- Your bread and butter for manipulating volume.  If you don't know what these are then read/skim [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2inpgx/concept_wednesday_sets/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2gnzem/concept_wednesday_reps_and_rep_ranges/). This is pretty straightforward, if you increase sets or reps then you're increasing your volume. Do more work to do more work. Whoa.

# Plateau-B-Gone

*Disclaimer: The assumption is made that under-recovery (whether it be through sleep or nutrition) is not the cause of your absence of progress*

Let's take a look at a pretty basic sentiment that I've read a bunch while lurking this board: ""I was doing the RR and my pull ups were stuck, then I tried the [Russian Fighter Pull Up Program](https://www.strongfirst.com/the-fighter-pullup-program-revisited/) and my pull ups went up!"" Let's compare the volume between the two approaches:

&#x200B;

RR - 3x5 Pullups 3x a week = 45 pullups per week

Russian Fighter -

>**Day 1**     5, 4, 3, 2, 1 = 15  
>  
>**Day 2**     5, 4, 3, 2, 2 = 16  
>  
>**Day 3**     5, 4, 3, 3, 2 = 17  
>  
>**Day 4**     5, 4, 4, 3, 2 = 18  
>  
>**Day 5**     5, 5, 4, 3, 2 = 19  
>  
>**Day 6**     Off  
>  
>**Day 7**     6, 5, 4, 3, 2  = 20

For a total of 105 pull ups in the first week.

&#x200B;

If you go to any bodybuilding board, the go-to advice for ""How do I get my \[body part\] bigger?"" is to do more work for that body part. Weightlifting boards? ""If you want to bench more \[weight\], then bench more \[often\]"". Calisthenics is no different. But hey, don't take my word for it. Try it out for yourself.

&#x200B;

# Pre-Made Routines and You

While there's nothing wrong with following a routine you found on the Internet, you aren't doing yourself any favors if you aren't willing to individualize the program. I like to teach through examples, so here we go.

**Situation A** \-- You've been running the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) for 3 months and you just can't seem to break past 3x6 negative pull ups, where you've been stuck for the past 3 weeks. You could change nothing because that's how the routine is written and pray that you'll progress during the next session. If that sounds like something you would do, then our friend [Vaas has some words for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBDi0iM2kcU).  Alternatively, you could realize that something isn't working and -- instead of jumping ship onto the next program -- you make a small *impactful* change and add an extra set or two for pull ups.

&#x200B;

**Situation B** \-- You've been training for 1.5 years. You're running an ""intermediate"" program from your favorite Calisthenics YouTuber and you notice it has no direct arm work. You're liking the physique you've been building the past 1.5 years, with no direct arm work, but find your arms are lagging in comparison to the ""main"" muscles of your torso. You can continue with avoiding direct arm work and hoping compounds will get your arms bigger even though they historically haven't been doing a good job (Please see previous youtube video from Vaas). Alternatively, you can add an extra 15-20 minutes at the tail end of your workout and go through a good 8-10 set workout for your arms.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. Why would you recommend these pre-made routines if you're just going to recommend we change them? Pre-made, cookie cutter routines are made for the average person and you are not average. Take what has been laid out to you and tweak it to fit your goals based on the results you've been getting.

# A Word of Caution

While volume is an amazing drug, it does have a couple dangers to it. Firstly, be sensible in your manipulation. Do not go from doing fuck all for volume to doing all the fucking volume. Never exercised before? Probably not a great idea to start with 30 sets a week for each major muscle group. Secondly, there is a limit to how much volume you can take. ""Systematic"" fatigue is real. Think of your body as an elevator and the volume of your work as the people in the elevator. There is only so much the elevator is good for before it'll give out and crash to the floor. Some things put less stress on the elevator. For example, if you solely want bigger biceps then do some curls instead of doing more chinups as it'll be easier to fit.  If you want to do the RR 3x a week, and go climbing 3x a week, and run a 5k every day, and go boxing 2x a week then maybe don't be surprised when you're aching 24/7.

"4 year mark of working out, it only gets better",kaasgork,639,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lhgiky/4_year_mark_of_working_out_it_only_gets_better/,1613032996.0,"What’s up guys. 

This summer I reached the mark of being into working out for 4 years. I have made so much progress physically but even more mentally. To me it’s crazy how physical activity can serve as such a boost for your confidence and well being overall, all the while being completely free. Imagine a pharmacy company finding a pill that may help cure depression, overcome anxiety, lowering chances of leading mortality causes CVD and certain cancers, increasing confidence and perseverance and the list goes on, the world would go crazy, right? Well, what if that pill already existed, in the form of healthy diet and exercise? That’s exactly what it is. Diet and exercise do not assure you a healthy life, let’s be honest here, life comes with a lot more obstacles and limitations which we do not entirely control. However, from the things we CAN actually impact, exercise is a great one, and it may just make your life a little more bearable. For those of you just starting to work out, don’t quit, the benefits will only become more clear the longer you do it. 

For those of you interested, I made a little video about my past 4 years experience in training. I wanted to give back to the community because I’m so grateful for what it has done for me so far. 

I tried including some tips that have helped me in staying consistent and having the best experience with the training I do. (sorry for the click baitey title, trying to reach a larger audience :))

Don’t quit homies, I promise you it will be worth it. 

Age: 21
Height: 171 cm
Weight: 69 kg

Concerning my diet, I try to stick to real foods while staying away from overprocessed ones. I think to gain mass and develop a good physique, it all narrows down to calories in vs. calories out, and of course an adequate amount of protein (which isn't extremely high, as often advertised). However, I'm also concerned with my health so I'm not really fond of added sugars and other additives. I try to eat 'natural' foods if that makes sense. I've also been vegetarian for almost 5 years now.

My training is really diverse, mostly calisthenics based. I do not stick to the same style of training all the time, but rather switch between barbells, bodyweight, functional exercises like rope climbing and here and there some powerlifting. I go running 3x per week and do some HIIT here and there for cardio. I can’t really put my finger on a certain kind of training and say: ‘this is what I do’, because I just prefer staying active and challenging my strength (and weaknesses) in different ways.

study: lowering weights better than lifting them,anthelmintic145,639,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ynlw81/study_lowering_weights_better_than_lifting_them/,1667728098.0,"Tough to *only* do the eccentric part of most weight lifting exercises, but this is quite helpful for BW exercise progressions and probably motivating for beginners, given how negatives are a big part of our progressions. 

This research suggests that doing negatives alone, (ie the eccentric) are better (for strength and muscle size) than doing both the concentric (lowering) and isometric (holding) parts of an exercise.

Beginners may want to program in negatives for all the main BW exercises. 

Negative pullups for example might be better by themselves, without the lifting part. So for those of us struggling with full pullups, let keep at it folks!

**Training**:

* **Background about me**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\_7z6VscypA&t=106s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_7z6VscypA&t=106s)

I've always been pretty active! I started lifting weights in middle school (around 7th grade) and lifting on and off somewhat consistently throughout high school. I never got super massive or jacked, but could easily rep out pushups and pullups. It gave me a good fitness foundation, an appreciation for training, and gave me some knowledge on how to exercise which were all very helpful. This is what I looked like around the senior year of high school: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cfBGlKMnxKz9zS64fi3Q0oA7UFUYUwgO/view?usp=sharing). I think I was like 100lbs in that picture.

When I started college, I was a lot more consistent with training, it was still a bit on and off but I gained weight and got bigger (as seen in the before pic). Overall I got much stronger. Around the end of my junior year of college I also started dabbling with weighted pullups and dips and got into yoga. I also by chance met some really strong guys doing calisthenics at our gym, thought it looked super cool and decided I would incorporate calisthenics into my training over the summer.

This background is mainly to highlight where I was coming from before calisthenics and to show that I didn't start calisthenics from scratch.

&#x200B;

* **Summer Before Senior Year**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=183](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=183)

Around June of 2019 is when I started. After doing research I decided I'd train for a front and back lever. I just YouTubed ""Front Lever"" tutorial and ""Back Lever"" tutorial and found a bunch of useful progressions and exercises which I incorporated into my lifting routine.

Essentially what I did was FL on pull and BL on push days. I trained PPLPP (or something like that I can't remember). The way I structured my workout was Static progressions in the beginning, then dynamics, then weights (which could be weighted calisthenics, bench, accessory workout etc.)

Overall, training was pretty straight forward and I got both moves before the end of the summer.

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 1**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=324](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=324)

Once the summer was over, I decided to continue my current training style. I focused on calisthenics with weights but now that I had FL and BL (with ok form. I also couldn't do it all the time) I decided I would work towards full planche.

So I pretty much continued in a similar training manner as I mentioned earlier and eventually got a full planche by the end of the semester (or about 4 months). Well, not really...Because my form was actually really bad and my elbows were bent so I wasn't actually doing a full planche. I didn't realize it at the time that I wasn't actually planching. Because I didn't know better I continued on thinking I was ready for harder moves.

I made a post regarding my planche mistake previously here if you want to take a look at that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full\_planche\_vs\_fake\_plache\_do\_it\_right\_the\_first/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full_planche_vs_fake_plache_do_it_right_the_first/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 2**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=456](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=456)

When my last semester of Senior year started I joined the gymnastics club and made some really cool friends. I also had access to a gymnastics gym too. This is where I fell in love with rings and realized I wanted to train towards advanced ring moves.

So I started working towards Iron Cross  and full planche on rings. I used the straps on forearms method to train for cross, but honestly it was mostly a waste of time. The straps didn't really develop the proper straight arm strength for cross, so other than some initial shoulder development I didn't find it useful.

I was also making fake progress on planche too (I thought it was real progress at the time). I progress all the way from tuck to a full planche (bent arms so it doesn't count) on rings. I also started exploring planche pushups but again the form was terrible.

On the bright side, my weighted calisthenics was going well. I increased my one rep max weighted pull and chinup to 2 plates. I also could do dips with a plate and a half with good form. I could also do 2 plates but it wasn't parallels so I don't count it. Oh I also got one arm chinups so that was also pretty awesome too!

&#x200B;

* **Summer**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=621](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=621)

So my senior year was a cut a bit short because COVID started at this point. I went back home around April 2020. I luckily made the smart decision to buy a power rack and continue training in my backyard and house which really payed off.

Earlier I started noticing there were weird quirks with my planche but I was still convinced I had a full planche. I posted a form check on reddit and someone pointed out my arms were bent. I was sad about it for a little while but eventually came to terms with it.

Again, check out the planche or YT video for more details b/c I'm mostly repeating myself. But TLDR I started from scratch, got injured from planche training for a few weeks, recovered, trained it some more but correctly (eblows locked) and eventually got a full planche.

For other moves Iron Cross was still a grind, I had to go through a few iterations and setups on how to train it to replace the strap method. I eventually ended on using resistance bands but my form always felt off so I was in an awkward limbo with the move.

On the bright side, around this time I started dabbling in other moves to improve on. They include front lever rows, one arm front lever, RTO dips, impossible dips, and victorian cross. I will never achieve these moves.

It was around this time I also found out about ""Overcoming Gravity 2"". I think it's really good and useful book. Great reference point for training and it helped me start thinking of other training concepts that I eventually started incorporating later on.

&#x200B;

* **Fall and Winter**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=936](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=936)

Once it started getting too cold to train outside, I moved my stuff inside and continued training. I made a good amount of progress during this time. All the foundational work I improved on over the summer began paying dividends.

I could actually full planche for a few seconds so I started working towards harder variations like full planche pushups and planche press.

Iron Cross was still kicking my ass so no real update there.

I managed to get a few reps of FL rows with a false grip and some of the other moves I was dabbling with over the summer where also improving. The most noteworthy one is that my victorian cross form was shaping up well. I was using lighter bands.

Really the main thing that happened during this time is the gradual progress I was making with most things I was training and the fact I incorporating some simple periodization. I spent a more time refreshing my knowledge of training and periodization was one thing that really stuck out to me. Incorporating that helped me feel less tired and in danger of hurting myself in the long run vs what I used to  do (i.e. not take deload weeks)

&#x200B;

* **Now**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1050](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)

Ok at this point I got really strong. Training wise I had a good understanding of how my body worked and how I needed to structure my workouts that worked best for me. I also incorporated a bit more complex periodization (though it wasn't always consistent) where I would ramp up and build towards strength phases. Also, I bought a dream machine for cross training, it was pricey but I found it useful.

My wrists hurt from typing at this point so I'll just list some of the things I managed to achieve now:

* [Full Planche, Full Planch Pushups, Full Planch on Rings, Full Planche Press to Handstand](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)
* [Impossible Dips and 3 Plate Dip](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1135) (not bellow parallel so needs more work)
* [Front Lever Rows and One Arm Front Lever](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1228)
* [3 Plate Chinup](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1254)
* [Maltese](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1288)
* and more

Oh I also got a [Victorian Cross](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1272) which was super sick. Still no iron cross...fuck that move. The dream machine I bought has been much more helpful in training towards it bs bands though so that's nice.

&#x200B;

* **Current Goals**:

I still love training calisthenics, my main life goal is to achieve F skills on rings eventually. Currently I'm focusing at the moment on getting Iron Cross, cleaning up my Maltese, Maltese Cross, and cleaning up my Victorian Cross

&#x200B;

* **MOST IMPORTANTLY I BECAME A DAD**:  [THIS IS MY BABY GIRL ADA!](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQztfvVA6AS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

&#x200B;

**Diet and Nutrition**:

* **General Info**:

I don't have much to say on my diet so this section is going to be brief. I'm in a lucky position where I've always been relatively skinny so I've never had to focus to much time on losing weight.

When I was in college, I was in a University that was ranked for having one of the best dinning services in the US. I always had access to healthy foods back then so my diet was varied and relatively clean with the occasional eating out. It was balanced as in I ate my fruits, veggies, grains, meats in most my meals. I couldn't tell you exactly what I ate because it was mostly intuitive. I don't count calories or anything.

Since college I've been living with my folks (moving out around April so that's exciting) and they cook every day. It's traditional Bengali dishes, so again food is generally clean and varied. I do however not eat as much veggies and fruits as I used back in college and need to fix that from a nutrition stand point. But over all I have an easy time maintaining a consistent weight.  I also rarely drink alcohol.

* **Bulking and Cutting**: So I don't bulk or cut. I like slowly gaining weight over time. That's just me.
* **Supplementation**: I take creatine and protein powder that's it. I think most people do not ""need"" supplements, a good rule of thumb is to use supplements to enhance lagging parts of your diet. Actually requiring supplements is probably a conversation between you and your doctor.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\_7z6VscypA&t=1298s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_7z6VscypA&t=1298s)

This post is already pretty long now so I'll keep this section a bit short.

* Training calisthenics is one of the best things to have ever happened to me. I'm the strongest I've ever been because of it. Part of the reason is I enjoy training it so much I'm very consistent with my training now!
* I've also met awesome people through it's really been a net positive in my life
* Be honest with yourself when you train, bad form can really waist your time or get you hurt
* Ada is the best

&#x200B;

All the best,

"24/M/5'11"" 1 Year, 4 Months Progress from Calisthenics/Gymnastics",Captain__Backfire,636,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cq0knw/24m511_1_year_4_months_progress_from/,1565735468.0,"Hi everyone! I posted a year and a bit ago on r/Fitness detailing the first year of my transformation.

A few days after posting that I discovered calisthenics and body-weight exercises and it completely changed my life. I used to lift weights 5-6 days a week and also did Judo/Muay Thai at the same time, but since moving home for the summer I switched into gymnastics in order to help me progress in my calisthenics and general flexibility, and man is it tough! I obviously still have a very long way to go before I can even say that I'm mediocre at many of the skills, but I am very happy with the progress I have made so far, and it's been inspiring seeing so many posts here and on r/Fitness showing people's progress. I work out a lot because it's sort of become my passion and my main hobby, and it honestly changed my whole life so I'm just hoping to help someone else out who's just starting or inspire someone like others did for me at the beginning.

I'm happy to answer any questions or take any criticisms you might have about how bad my squat and deadlift are (I didn't start training back/legs until late in the game...)!

*(bonus) Before Calisthenics:* *April 2018* – [https://imgur.com/a/1obbwOu](https://imgur.com/a/1obbwOu)

One of the main things I noticed after over a year of body-weight training is that my body-weight dropped significantly. If you’ll notice from the April 2018 picture, before starting calisthenics, my body fat % was still way over 10%. I’m not sure how low it is now, but if I had to guess I would say it’s around 8% (feel free to correct me if you think otherwise!).

&#x200B;

**Here is a list of some of the skills I have progressed in over the past year and 4 months (anything listed as weighted is a one-rep max):**

Push-Ups 30 > 70 -  Weighted Push-Ups 20lbs > 90lbs

Pull-Ups 5 > 20  -  Weighted Pull-Ups 15lbs > 95lbs

Dips 10 > 35 -  Weighted Dips 45lbs > 135lbs

Pistol Squats 0 > 15/side

**Sunday – Core & Gymnastics**

· Same as Tuesday/Thursday.

&#x200B;

Right now I have gymnastics on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays for about 3.5 hours a night, meaning I can only train weights three days a week. Until September I've changed my shoulder day to be a part of my chest/triceps day.

My workouts changed significantly, as I shifted from just doing weights every day to doing mostly weighted calisthenics. I saw a lot of videos online of people doing these crazy moves on the bar with their body and decided I wanted to try it out.

My diet also changed significantly as I started to cut out all of the fast food, junk food, sugar, and unnecessary carbohydrates. I stopped drinking for the most part, which has also helped a lot, because not only am I never ""too hungover to workout"", I don't have those empty calories holding me back. Since giving up alcohol and fast food/junk food, I’ve noticed dramatic increases in my workout progress and my wallet hates me less.

**Here is what my diet mainly consists of:**

*Protein -* Chicken, eggs, fish, steak, duck, Greek yogurt

*Carbs -* Quinoa, fruit (berries, avocado, dates, figs mostly), vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, sweet potato, green beans, SPINACH)

I cut out most dairy products and white foods like pasta/bread/potato stuff because I found it just made me bloated and sluggish. I don’t drink coffee or tea, only water because I prefer it. I get a lot of questions to why I don’t have any peanut butter or nuts in my diet – I’m allergic. :(

But I’ve already noticed some change this early. I can do the exercises quicker. I have had to lessen my incline a bit to keep things at the same difficulty as when I started. My body is ALREADY acclimating to the daily exercise. 

So I put up my pull up bar and did Day 4. I’m not really anymore tired than when I started. I hate BWF a bit ;)

Here's a Follow Along Warmup Video for the Recommended Routine!,Antranik,637,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/acji88/heres_a_follow_along_warmup_video_for_the/,1546617712.0,"Hi everybody, Antranik here... and in the tradition of making the [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) easier to digest, I've made another follow-along video, this time, for the first few individual exercises of the warmup that include:

1. Yuri's Band Shoulder Exercise (light band required)
1. Deep Squat Sky Reaches (no equipment required)
1. Dead Bugs (two versions, no equipment required)

# Video: https://youtu.be/Pz1sXqj8Ccw

After you do those 3, how you continue your warmup depends on where you are with your capabilities...

* If you can do negative pullups or beyond, do 10 scapular pulls.
* If you can do negative dips or beyond, do 30secs of support hold.
* After you reach Bulgarian Split Squats, do an easier form of 10 squats (like regular air squats) as a precursor.
* After you reach Banded Nordic Curls, warmup with 10 Romanian deadlifts or Single Leg Deadlifts.

Then, you do your upper and lower body strength training. And to finish it up, you do the core triplet of Rollouts, Pallof Presses and Reverse Hyperextensions, which I made a [follow along video for earlier this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9m6dxn/our_recommended_routine_has_3_core_exercises_the/)

One of the unexpected outcomes has been that I suddenly look and feel leaner. There hasn't been much change in my weight, but my muscles seem more pronounced and I feel stronger.

The most important factor in training is consistency. So try not to get too bogged down in details, pick a routine and *stick to it*. Have fun. Crush your enemies and delight your friends."
My bodyweight experience / solving hip problems from sedentary lifestyle,OnlyLittleFly,627,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1035kwr/my_bodyweight_experience_solving_hip_problems/,1672844188.0,"I decided to write a quick story of my short bodyweight journey so far, maybe it will help someone with similar problems. I am M / 39 / 173 cm / 74 kg.

I was always physically active through my youth, played soccer a lot, did some old-school gym/fitness at university, ran a couple of half-marathons, did some yoga at home, etc. I started a company 10 years ago and it was a lot of hard work and sedentary lifestyle - in the first 5 years I logged around 16 hours per day, including most of the weekends, constantly sitting behind a computer (I am a graphic designer).

So about a year ago, my issues started to heavily pile up. First, strong iliopsoas pain, which I managed to solve with targeted massage and stretching. But then my right hip started to get very painful with shooting pain in certain positions, for example when getting out of the car and also randomly when I was walking. I took an MRI and there was no obvious problem, maybe a small hint at small labral tear, but nothing major.

Funny part was that it never hurt under direct stress, like walking in steep hills, it actually felt better under load. So it slowly became obvious that my right hip was heavily inflamed due to bad muscular support and prolonged sitting. CBD and massage + stretches helped a tiny bit, but when I tried to start running again, it just became worse and worse. Jeff Cavaliere's videos (Athlean-x) helped with some pain relief and understanding the anatomy of underlying issues so I decided I need professional help.

I got a good private trainer at a functional gym, explaining my problems and pointing out that I want to focus on bodyweight exercises, so I can continue training at home when I'm happy with the progress. The assessment we did showed the obvious - bad posture, weak glutes, tight hamstrings, tight hip flexors, poor external hip rotation and heavy anterior pelvic tilt.

We started with light correction exercises, focusing on learning how to squat properly, how to hinge properly, how to do side lunges properly, posture resets before all exercises in order to fix the anterior pelvic tilt and create flexibility and range of motion in hips/pelvic area. Additionally, breathing exercises, activating lower abs and expanding the upper chest.

After a month/two I started doing progression exercises with kettlebells - swings, cleans, presses, squats and then in the next months moving on to windmills and Turkish get ups. Similarly, I did a lot of lunge progressions, slowly adding weights, lifting front foot, etc. Also doing a lot of upper body exercises in between of course, push ups, dumbbell presses, etc. And finally adding more demanding exercises like pull-ups and deadlifts in the 5th/6th month. I was shocked at how much progress I was making with 2x a week training.

So now I am almost at the end of my 6th month and will start exercising alone from home. I have spent about 1600 eur on coaching, and man was it worth every cent. I finally understand **why** I am doing the exercises and how the form/posture affects the muscles involved in the exercise. My muscles have woken up, my upper body is visually more defined, I gained about 2kg of muscle mass, I feel strong and healthy, my posture has improved and I fell in love with exercising again, so I can't wait to see the progress in the next 6 months or a year.

And most importantly, the pain in the hip is **gone**. It disappeared in a couple of weeks of training and never came back. I went running this Sunday, first time after 10 months (just a short 3 km distance) and it felt great. My calves are sore as hell, but my hip didn't lock up and it feels just fine.

So my advice would be - start exercising as soon as possible and put in the hours. If you have an underlying medical condition - hire a trainer, at least for a short time. Investing in your body will pay off immensely."
I progressed from barely doing 1 pull up to doing 15 straight in 4 months while bulking,LiarWithTheAce,631,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/x5sabe/i_progressed_from_barely_doing_1_pull_up_to_doing/,1662311831.0,"In May I (23M 5'9"" 130lbs at the time) started doing BWF following an app on my phone. It didn't include pull ups, but I bought a doorway pull-up bar so I could incorporate them. In school I could usually do 6-8 chin ups but I hadn't attempted them in years. When I tried with my new bar I was barely able to do 1 wide grip pronated pull up. Today I did 15 straight pull ups for the first time (then a second 15 rep set after 3 minutes rest) weighing 145lbs. I know it's pretty basic compared to what some people on this sub are doing but it feels great to hit that milestone and I thought I'd share what worked for me.

I stopped doing pure bodyweight fitness pretty quickly because I feel like it's easier to get stronger faster with resistance. (I hope this isn't a controversial take on this sub.) For 2 months I did a PPLR split with resistance bands and dumbbells, and included pull ups at the end of my workout on pull and leg days. 

I started my pull up progression by working up to a set of 5. Then I tried to work up to 25 pull ups in as many sets as I needed until I could do 5x5. From their I tried to increase my total volume every week or so until I got to 5x10. My progression there was something like 5x5>5x6>3x8>4x8>4x10>5x10, usually hitting my target reps on the first few sets then having to split up the last set to hit my target reps. I increased the volume when I was able to hit my target reps on every set.

After 2 months of working out at home I joined the gym and started running 5/3/1 BBB with pull ups as accessory movements twice a week. 5x10 Bodyweight one day 5x5 weighted the other, I've been doing them +25lbs recently. I also did a +68lbs chin up recently. In the gym I also do them on rings or smooth bars as opposed to the padded bar I use at home so my grip strength has had to catch up. Today was my first time testing my max on my bar at home in a while and it increased from 12 to 15. Now I'm shooting for 20 reps @ 155lbs bodyweight by the end of the year."

I hit a bit of a milestone the other day. It's the been a year since I started working out regularly, reining in my diet, giving a shit about my health.

I've been doing the Recommended Routine for about 7 months, after bouncing around different bodyweight routines. 

I lost a majority of the weight just from cutting out soda and fast food from my diet. I would hit up one chain to the next, it was bad.

Now I drink almost exclusively water, coffee and tea being the exceptions. I only eat fast food on occasion, and only a reasonable portion.

When I started I couldn't even do one good pushup, I could barely do dip holds, forget about even hanging off a pullup bar.

Now I can crush diamond pushups easily, I can do 3 pullups (maybe 2 good ones...), I can crank out dips all day!

Sure I could eat a little better, sure I could work out harder, more often, but I've been doing what I can!"

Max Strength Is Not Everything: Seeing The Bigger Picture,Prowland12,626,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/11fzsge/max_strength_is_not_everything_seeing_the_bigger/,1677754103.0,"**Intro**

I never thought I'd say this, but *Crossfit was right*. Sort of. Well, really the Old School was right. Allow me to explain. In our relentless pursuit of strength, it can become easy to forget that an impressive maximum weight pullup or planche is **not** the only important facet of fitness. As the functional fitness community once astutely pointed out, are you really fit if you can't express strength in a variety of situations?

The reality is that most activities of daily living, athletic endeavors, and strenuous physical jobs are hybrid activities, requiring a blend of various strength qualities. A soldier's 1 rep bench press is not assessed because it does not determine their readiness for the rigors of combat, nor does a footballer's max back squat determine if they have the leg stamina to withstand 90 minutes of intense play. Imagine a rock climber with an iron-strong grip that only lasts 10 seconds, or a swimmer with bulging lats that vomits as soon as their upper body muscles are flooded with lactic acid. What about a sprinter with strong legs that can't run fast? Or a ballerina who is only able to lift their leg up to hip height? This sort of dysfunction may seem ridiculous, but it's the exact sort of problem that can arise from training without variety and purpose. 

**Stuck at Step 1**

I see many people's approach to strength training as boiling down to this.

1. Get strong.
2. ????
3. Profit.

Ask yourself, how much of your hard-earned strength can you really translate outside of a 1 or 5 rep max? Can you translate that strength into explosive force? Can you use your strength over a long period of time? Can you use your strength in extreme ranges of motion? Can you rely on your joints and tendons to handle the load you are putting on your muscles? Can you confidently say you're doing everything possible to perform better? Are you even coordinated enough to pull off the skills you want to accomplish?

Why are we only emphasizing one part of the equation? Is it not apparent, nay, obvious that (at least some of) our training should be be devoted to becoming a more well-rounded athlete?  We know, logically, that our bodies adapt only to the specific stimulus we expose them to. Yet our current paradigm leads us to pigeon-hole ourselves into the pursuit of maximal strength at the expense of all other athletic qualities.

**Learning From The Old School Paradigm**

This is where I circle back to what I mean by the Old School. I consider the old school ""method"" as being military and prison-style workouts, the use of extremely minimal or no equipment, technical mastery of simple movements and focus on quality over quantity. Examples of this are the YouTuber Iron Wolf [https://www.youtube.com/@IronWolf84](https://www.youtube.com/@IronWolf84) or good old Al Kavadlo [https://www.youtube.com/@alkavadlo/featured](https://www.youtube.com/@alkavadlo/featured) 

The old school has fallen out of style, for various reasons. I was fortunate to be exposed to the basic tenets of it during my first days at the gym as a kid, as my father showed me the merits of high repetition chinups, dips, leg raises, russian twists, and pushups. My first days of learning about calisthenics and training were also during the brief time on social media before online fitness trends became much more homogenous and heavily commercialized. Had I not had a fit parent who was of an older generation and also stumbled into some dusty corners of the internet, it is unlikely I would have ever seen this other way of looking at things.

The key takeaway was that I wasn't just training to get stronger. I was training to get *better.* I did not want to just have strong muscles, I wanted to *master* the movements. I wanted to be able to do pullups in my sleep, still have a picture-perfect leg raise at the end of a hard workout, and have no problem dropping and doing a few sets of crisp explosive pushups whenever I felt the need to.

**A Mastery-Based Approach**

When we look at the most accomplished athletes in the world, most of what they are doing is still just the basics. A 9 year old in a basketball rec league and Lebron James both have to dribble, pass, and shoot a ball. The difference is that Lebron James is orders of magnitude *better* at these movements. He has put in the time and effort to train his nervous system for maximum efficiency.

Strength can be viewed the same way. It is not just the ability to produce force. It is an indication of neurological efficiency, a measure of *skill.* If you want to really progress beyond the beginner-intermediate level, train for years and avoid stupid injuries, absorb this idea. Focus on your goals, raise your standards for your training over time, build a strong athletic foundation, and attack your weakpoints in technique, mobility, endurance, power, etc. 

Now go out and do your best!"

I have started with a community goal of 1,000,000 push ups (for everyone that is participating), with the help of this sub, I am sure we can do this.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBn9diObqs0Sz-ouS-iP63IZ5hu5GcsL73G5dVQxWqo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBn9diObqs0Sz-ouS-iP63IZ5hu5GcsL73G5dVQxWqo/edit?usp=sharing)

Here is the link of the sheet, you just enter your name on the left column if you like and the amount of push ups you have done next to it, the number of total will add itself.  This is a complete honor system, please DM me if you want to participate and I will give you the link.

For those that wants to participate just open the link and send a request for editor role.

I have approved everyone that have already sent me a request, please let me know if you can't edit the sheet and need help with it.

Update on the challenge 5/5

Thanks for everyone thats participating, surprised with the amount of people that is making this happen.  All of you motivate me to push myself farther than I would ever would,  however we do need more as a group to achieve the 1,000,000 push ups goal, looking for more motivated people to join us.   

Current Number of participates: 173       Total push ups: 37255         Completion: 3.726% "
3 things I learnt | From 0 to 8 strict muscle ups in 12 months,eatsleephustle,628,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a9fkad/3_things_i_learnt_from_0_to_8_strict_muscle_ups/,1545751126.0,"Last year this time, I was 172 lbs and I can’t even do 2 pull ups. But I made a new year resolution to lose weight and to learn muscle up. After 12 months of grind, I went from zero to hitting 8 strict muscle ups, and even lost 20 pounds throughout my journey. ([This is a video documenting my muscle up transformation](https://youtu.be/ZBgEfSbm8go)). Here are a few tips I would like to share from my experience:

**Learn to Kip**

* It is completely acceptable to kip your way to your first muscle up if you are a beginner. Try doing explosive knee raises so you could get used to the momentum. As you can see from my first muscle up in my video, I sticked my chest out at the bottom of the motion and did an explosive knee raises to swing myself up and over the bar.
* After you have done your first kipping muscle up, keep training until you are able to do 5-6 kipping muscle ups. Then you are ready to clean up your muscle up.

**Do high L-sit pull ups instead of weighted pull ups**

* I used to think doing weighted pull ups will help me gain the pull power necessary to achieve strict muscle ups. It is only half true. Weighted pull ups do not simulate the C trajectory pertinent to muscle up and does little to smoothen your transition.
* Doing L-sit pull ups, on the other hand, does two things. First, it encourages us to pull to our waist lines, which helps us develop the explosiveness expected in a muscle up. Second, it opens our shoulders and puts our lats in a difficult position to initiate the pull. This teaches us to hold our arms straight in between reps. That said, I do acknowledge we wont be able to do L-sit pull up anywhere. As you can see in my video, I did weighted pull ups as my university gym has a low ceiling.

**Cluster sets**

* There is no better way to train your muscle ups than doing muscle ups. If you are looking to increase your reps, you should be doing cluster sets. The concept is simple. You do 2 reps, rest for 10 to 15 seconds, do 2 more, and repeat until you reach 8 reps. Then rest for 2 to 3 mins. Repeat the whole set five times.
* At the end of the day, you will have done 40 muscle ups in one single workout. Compared to if you were to hit your max reps each set (say your personal best is 6), you would probably end up with, for instance, 6+5+5+4+3 = 23 reps. That means 17 extra reps right there if you do the cluster sets (provided that you really grind through those tough sets).

Disclaimer: I am no professional street workout athlete and the above is just the methods that worked for me. Feel free to share your thoughts and also your new year resolutions!

I also invite you to follow me on instagram ([@jme\_cal](https://www.instagram.com/jme_cal/)) where I will share with you my thoughts on philosophy, discipline, posture and bodyweight trainings in general."
How working out helped transform me from an overweight and socially anxious teenager to the confident person I am today,rz-0605,619,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/waelvu/how_working_out_helped_transform_me_from_an/,1659026308.0," A few years ago, when I was in my young teenage years, I was very overweight. I don’t remember how much I weighed, but I remember my doctor telling me that with my BMI, I was considered obese. This wasn’t really a surprise to me. I hated the way I looked and felt. I could barely get up a flight of stairs at my school without being out of breath at the top. When summer came, l wore the same hoodies and long pants I had worn during the winter to hide the body that I was insecure about. Even during the hottest days, when the temperature got to above 95°F, I could be seen with a hoodie and long pants on. Whenever I came back from going outside I would be drenched with sweat on the inside. My friends always wondered if I ever took off my hoodie, and they would often question if I even owned a pair of shorts.

Beyond the physical discomfort I felt being overweight, I also had mental roadblocks. I was so unconfident in myself that I avoided talking to other people. I developed bad social anxiety and I had a tough time talking to people. I had a few friends but I struggled with making new ones. I had low self esteem, which lead to other things such as depression. 

I had always wanted to lose weight, but I never got around to doing so. I kept telling myself that I would start the next week, but that never happened. You know when you say you’re going to start working on something at 2:00, but when 2:01 rolls around you push it to 2:30, then 2:31 comes and it gets pushed to 3:00, and the cycle repeats? That’s what happened to me. 

Well one Monday in March of 2017 I decided I wanted change. Instead of saying “I’ll start working out tomorrow”, I decided that that day was the day I was going to transform my body. I searched up an at home workout on YouTube, and got to work.

From that point on I slowly integrated exercise into my daily routine. Eventually, I made it a habit to workout every day no matter how I felt. I developed an app that helped me keep track of my workouts and integrated HIIT timers in it so I wouldn’t have to watch the same YouTube video over and over again and listen to their music. I started seeing results as I exercised, which further motivated me to continue with my goal. 

Fast forward to today, I’m in the best shape of my life. I have completely changed my body composition from a fat overweight teen with no muscle to being at 10% body fat all year round from bodyweight training. Not only am I physically healthy, but I am confident in myself. I can talk to other people confidently and public speaking no longer gives me stress and anxiety. I can finally enjoy all that life has to offer.

To anyone who wants to start their fitness journey or become healthier, START NOW! If you keep telling yourself you’re going to start tomorrow you most likely never will. Even if it’s just a short walk around your neighborhood, a little progress each day adds up to big results."
Super slow movements during exercices.

I did my own high intensity stretching routine focused on hamstrings. This are my results after one month.

I am not an expert. I'm just a guy who read too much posts. This routine is quite intense, so it can produce pain. I got a lot of DOMS from doing it and if you follow it, you may get injured or your postural issues could get worse. Obviously, I deny any responsibility if any of that happens. Be careful.

Second of all, the pics, or didn't happen:

# Routine

This is the basic template, when I started:  
.   

Exercise | Reps (per leg) 
---|---
[Nerve flossing \(sliding\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMbKv94Bu_U) | 12 
Nerve flossing (stretching) | 12 
[High kicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhCfC47eykg) | 12-15 
[Knee extensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SHk9Q054yM) | 12 
[End of range leg lifts, no hold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05V3T0thKj0) | 12 
[[Lying hamstring stretch \(Contract-Relax\)](https://youtu.be/z5ByuvT-zCg?t=21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkI6ezhl-iI) | 2 cycles, ~90 seconds each
Standing pike pulses | 70 (bilateral)
.  

How did I came up with that routine? Well, I just added all the techniques I had read regarding hamstring flexibility: dynamic stretches, active mobility, nerve flossing, end of range drills, PNF with contract-relax protocols and ballistic stretching. I ordered from least intense to more intense and *voilà*.  

Because of my impatience, at the end I was doing closer to 15 reps of each exercise, plus I started doing the hold at the end of range leg lift (5 s hold and only 4 reps per leg) and replaced the knee extensions for this harder kind of [knee extension](https://youtu.be/ki8ZaeXmkaM?t=108). The pulses also went to around 90 reps.

#Frequency

I stretched 5 days a week (sometimes 6), alternating between intense and light days. On intense days, I'd do the whole routine. On light days, I just did static pike stretching instead of using the lying hamstring stretch, and no pulses. The idea was to maintain a high frequency and to give my hammies some rest at the same time.

#Background and measurements

I have to be honest, this is not the first time I stretched. I've been stretching on and off for years, never with too much success. Even when I started this experiment, I already was doing a similar stretching routine after months of no mobility work. So, the first picture already shows some of those gains. Besides, I've been a little more flexible than in the before pic in past years, which means that I regained some range of motion. However, I've never been as flexible as in the after pic. For example, now I'm able to kiss my knees with my straight legs, something that I never did before.

I took the pictures already warmed up. The warm-up is just the first 5 exercise of the original routine. I'm also stretching as hard as I can. I did it this way to eliminate possible variations in intensity or muscle preparedness. Sadly, it also means that's not my cold flexibility.

BTW, I know the angle I drew isn't the correct hip angle. I just picked the most reliable way to draw an angle that allows me to make an objective comparison.

EDIT2: To clarify, **if I let my back to round, I can place my whole hand on the floor**, at ease. I took the pictures with a straight back to isolate the hamstrings.

#Other comments

This kind of intense stretching always leaves my back and hips feeling weird and weak. To counter act that and to prevent my APT from getting worse, I performed isometric ab exercises and hip flexors stretches at the end of every session. I feel like those exercises return some balance to my body. 

Also, there's the DOMS. At first, it was pretty intense, so I had to do some hip thrusts and kicks in order to warm-up the muscle thoroughly before even starting the routine. As the days went by, the soreness became less intense and the nerve flossing and high kicks were enough to avoid stretching with pain.

Sometimes I also lacrosse-balled my [quadratus lumborum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratus_lumborum_muscle). It really helps release my tight lower back. Now I think I should've add foam roalling in the warm-up, but I didn't want to make it too long.

#Conclusion

In all my years stretching on and off, I never progressed this fast. It was hard, but it was worth it. I don't know if doing all of that was strictly necessary, but at least I know it gave me good results.

I hope you find this useful!

Slowing tempo as a way to add difficulty in lieu of adding weight.,Sedkno,622,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/l9yurf/slowing_tempo_as_a_way_to_add_difficulty_in_lieu/,1612169639.0,"What are people’s views on slowing down the tempo of your reps - and therefore increasing time under tension - as a way to add difficulty in a progression? 

The tempo prescribed by the RR IS 10X0, so would there be value in building up to 20X0 and 30X0 and so on? Or even replacing the explosive phase with a slow movement? 

Assuming the goal is hypertrophy and this is used as a substitute to adding weight to pull-ups, push-ups and dips etc.

A Note on Walking,None,624,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7d12nr/a_note_on_walking/,1510714292.0,"Okay, not really sure where else to post this, but bwf is my main form of exercise. I dig yoga, rock climbing, hiking, but most of all, I find so much value in walking. The majority of us should do it more.

But my specific reason for this post is to encourage you to think about what muscles are being used while walking. Notably, focus in your glutes, hamstrings, and arches of your feet. 

Are you collapsing your arches, or keeping them engaged?

Are you pulling with your hamstrings, almost like propelling the ground beneath you?

Are you extending at the hip and engaging your glutes?

Every step I take, it's a nice contraction along the posterior chain of my leg. Feels good."
Program to hit 100+ pushups in a row,Alpha-Panda,625,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a852op/program_to_hit_100_pushups_in_a_row/,1545356539.0,"So I recently made a program designed to up endurance performance in the most efficient way possible (combination of ‘greasing the groove’, pyramid sets, sets to failure, etc.). It is almost impossible to do 100 pushups nonstop from the beginning but in theory, if you keep running the program you should eventually get there. 

You enter in the number of maximum reps you can currently do where it says to and it personalizes a program for your level!

I tried to make it so that rest days were placed where necessary and work days hardly ever took more than 10 minutes to do, so technically speaking that should rid the excuse of “I can’t do it I don’t have time.”

Anyone do the Knees Over Toes ATG exercises?,michaelenzo,618,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/smxsf3/anyone_do_the_knees_over_toes_atg_exercises/,1644260189.0,"I recently started doing some Knees over Toes Guy ATG exercises like slantboard bodyweight split squats, against the wall tib raises, nordic curls, etc and found them to be incredibly challenging. 

I take this in general as a good sign as I'm decently advanced in the core powerlifts. I'm adding them in as accessories at the end of my training sessions or as warmups. Right now I'm starting slow with just bodyweight, but plan to add some resistance as they eventually get easier.

Ben Patrick's princple is basically to train your muscles and tendons at their extremeties to build up strength and protection. There are critics out there who say that you should never put your muscles in those positions because they're unnatural and you're more likely to suffer injuries. I'm not an exercise science expert so curious on anyone's experience with them.

Anyone here have experience with doing these exercises, or doing his program? What's been results been like for you? How has it helped you in terms of your athleticism? Did you see any injuries from doing them?"
How do I make working out fun for someone who literally hates it?,None,627,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lqkrhd/how_do_i_make_working_out_fun_for_someone_who/,1614093499.0,"Hi all!
So, pretty straightforward & as the title says, I’m trying to make working out fun for my (25 F) SO (30M).
I’ve always been really health conscious and have always loved working out. It makes me feel so good, the kind of high that we all chase after.

I’ve been with my partner a couple of years now & he’s complained EVERY DAY about his body and how he wants to change it for the better. He’s gained about 50-60 lbs since we began dating (i do love me some huskiness) BUT, I mean, being 50 lbs overweight and at the age we are... we need be serious about preliminary actions for our health. I don’t want him to have a stroke or heart attack in a couple years, ya know?

Around Christmas, he got really serious for a month and dropped 10 lbs and finally gain a bit of a bicep.
But then one day, we visited his parents, they noticed  the changes and he just stopped seriously working out with me since then. 
I have literally pulled the yoga mats out in front of the TV while he is watching and try to get him to work out & he’d just, “eh maybe I’ll give it 5 minutes....” or go upstairs to F off. (Which is another thing, he thinks a 5-10 minute at home work out is going to erase the ice cream he eats every night)

I have NO clue how to keep pushing him now. I’ve tried doing our own workouts, following fun YouTube videos, telling him to of course take his time, create strength in form, researched easier work outs to compromise for his “weak knees and back”, hell, I’ve even drawn out different work outs, put them in a bag and said, “let’s pick at least 10 and we will do those!” Try and make it a fun game, ya know? 

But with all that, he still loses interest. Still complains daily about his “spare tire” and health. But will not do anything about it? 

TL;DR— I love working out, boyfriend does NOT. How do I motivate him?

Edit (because I’m tired of clarifying but totally my fault for not adding this important detail) he *asked* me for help. I never forced this on him. I don’t “hate what he looks like”.  He’s amazing in more ways than I can count. He just hates most forms of physical activity :) TY!"
Hamstring slides have let me run again.

Any time I ran even a km it would start to swell and if I pushed it to 5km i could barely walk for a week. I could only do online physio due to lockdown. Their recommendation was a mix of basic glute and hamstring exercises. I pretty much dismissed the fact that I could have weak hamstrings as I could deadlift over 2.5 times my bodyweight... I was very wrong. 

I started the RR at the start of January. As part of that I have been doing hamstring slides using a skateboard, I've never felt such a deep effort in my hamstrings before, and the first DOMS were fairly intense! I went for a run last week, and for the first time in months I could go for a run just two days later and felt absolutely fine. 

Moving from free weights to bodyweight exercises for the first time in 10 years due to lockdown seems to have been a bit of a blessing on my body. I'm feeling a lot of benefit to the balance of the RR, so massive thanks to the community here for putting that together!!"

Before: 80kgs/17.5% Body Fat

After: 73kgs/14.2% Body Fat

I would like to share with all of you, but mostly with the people who are just starting out or the ones indecisive on how to start with the bodyweight fitness journey, some tips and lessons that have helped me with my progress and love with the calisthenic movement.

# 1. Just do it

Most of the progress starts by just showing up, I see a multitude of questions in the daily questions thread about what is the best way to start doing pullups/squats/rows, given that I have X restrictions or afraid of doing it incorrectly. My advice is, **just do it** stop overthinking on what is the optimal way of training and go ahead and start moving your body around, you will eventually get a hold of the movement and will find a way to do it better over time. Also, I love seeing people on their first day of working out at the park/gyms doing their exercises incorrectly, because that means they care, they want to do something for their health, eventually with time and enough will, they start noticing better pattern movements. Nobody ever had idea on their first day of training on what ""[range of motion](https://www.verywellhealth.com/overview-range-of-motion-2696650)"" or ""[time under tension](https://mealprepmanual.com/time-under-tension-and-muscle-growth/)"" meant, this is knowledge you get over time. Trust me, you are not getting injured by doing wall push ups and learning the movement pattern.

# 2. Rest and Eating

Before my bodyweight journey I was an avid gym goer, but didn't care too much on rest times, nor I tracked what I ate. The results? I felt fatigued and didn't see any physical progress. When I started the RR i noticed the ""huge"" gaps of rest time between sets, my first thought was ""oh well i can cut that in half"", but noticed how my performance decreased when I cut rest times for less than the specified 1'30"", so I sticked to these rest times and this was a pivotal moment for my training, I suddenly progressed way faster than any other time doing strength training. Heck I even bought a watch just to track this golden minute and a half. And for the eating part? I payed a MyFitnessPal subscription for 3 months to understand my[ TDEE](https://tdeecalculator.net/), after reading the wiki on r/Fitness I set myself a specific diet with good protein distribution within my macros and eventually didn't have to track it daily since I got a hold of what I was eating throughout the day, I attribute most (at least 50%) of the progress to this.

# 3. Stick to the progressions

Another frequent question I see on this sub is people wanting to get creative and start mixing, removing and adding exercises within the RR, this is a huge mistake (in my opinion and experience) since you don't let your body create an organic adaptation to the movements and patterns of the RR exercises, in all of this period I have sticked to the exercises mentioned in the routine making progress, when I started I could barely do 1 chinup, now I do 3x10 weighted (10lbs) pullups. So yes, consistency is king.

# 4. Don't stick to a routine

(Outside the recommended routine) I religiously did 3 times a week (sometimes just 2) my RR, but around it? I switched up almost every week, why? because I tried doing things that I enjoyed doing, for example, some weeks on Tuesdays and Thursdays I went out and ran 5k, sometimes 7k and sometimes I just walked 4k, whichever I was feeling like doing. Some weekends I went mountain biking for almost 30k, on another week I had intense padel games with my neighbours at night. I even went on doing Crossfit for a couple of days with a friend of mine just to learn something new (I didn't like it, but I did learn a lot from it). So my advice is[ keep moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJDz7qHBGQg&ab_channel=LondonReal), even in the in-between-days. Of course it is vital to have complete rest days (1 or 2 are enough) I just took them whenever my body asked me to.

# 5. Believe the ""Mobility & Flexibility"" hype

Honestly, I wouldn't have been able to progress that much if it hadn't been for my brother insisting me to do mobility exercises, I started by doing follow-alongs on YouTube by[ Tom Merrick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0DZhN-8KFLYO6beSaYljg), this were very basic movements and I couldn't do most of them without trembling, I never did Yoga or anything before as I felt intimidated by all of this complex moving patterns, the videos helped me out as a beginner (I couldn't touch my shins when doing pikes, now I'm 2 cm away from my toes). It also helped me understand my body, I finally got what the[ rotator cuff](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-my-rotator-cuff#1) was and how medular it is for most of the upper body bodyweight training exercises. The cool thing about it? This just took me 20 minutes of my day, so I did them at least 4 days a week. On monday I'll be doing some Yoga for the first day in my life, wish me luck."
Mark Rippetoe's chin-up protocol for fixing Golfers Elbow.,MiAnClGr,617,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jlxgbq/mark_rippetoes_chinup_protocol_for_fixing_golfers/,1604209394.0,"I'm writing this post to recommend Rippetoe's chin-up protocol as a fix for Golfers Elbow. I was super sceptical of this at first because it seems so counter intuitive, especially compared to most other information out there.

For those of you unaware of what I'm talking about, Rippetoe suggests a high volume chin-up protocol with 2-3 reps per set for a large amount of sets (15 -20) and repeating every 5 days.

I have been dealing with Golfers elbow from incorrect pullup technique (over flexing of the wrists to get higher over the bar) for about 6 months and have tried many things, including daily high rep tyler twists on a flex bar. The tyler twists seem to fix the pain but as soon as I tried to do pullups again the pain quickly returned.

I came across this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77cCx1dZp70&t=28s&ab\_channel=StartingStrength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77cCx1dZp70&t=28s&ab_channel=StartingStrength) where Rip discusses the protocol, and out of desperation gave it a go.

I switched from pullups to chin-ups and made sure my form was spot on (wrists unflexed and elbows driving down to my sides). I did them slowly with an especially slow eccentric.

The first couple of times I did this it hurt like crazy for the first 5 sets and then the pain would go away. It would return once I was done and cooled down but then after about a day of rest it would feel great. After doing the routine for about a month the pain slowly turned into a dull ache and now about 2 months later has almost completely disappeared. 

I can't recommend this enough. Has anyone else had experience with this?"
Fifty-Plus Fitness,The_Badger_,617,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ibijvk/fiftyplus_fitness/,1597685252.0,"Me: Male, 55 years old 

Height: 6’1” (185 cm) 

Weight: 180 lbs (82 kg) 

Goal: To be above average for my age (and at least 10 pull ups!)

Hello! I’m so grateful to this sub for directing me to a fitness program that really clicks for me at age 55. I didn’t get serious about exercise until Q3 2018, when my teenage son had major heart valve surgery. I work a sedentary desk job, often sitting 8 hours a day, and wanted to show him by example that fitness is important and that it’s never too late to start. I started with jogging, which led me to the Apple Watch, which got me obsessively closing my rings and trying to exercise 30 min/day. But I hate running, so I tried jumping rope (which I still enjoy) but eventually settled mostly on walking a lot to close my rings. I was able to lose quite a bit of weight just with that and IF, going from about 195 down to 185 lbs. I have never been very strong, so in Q2 of 2019 I tried working with a trainer, whose technique was Super Slow. I stopped doing that after six months because it was just too expensive. When quarantine hit I came across BWF, and honestly it has helped me change my body composition dramatically in just a few months, even more than did the personal trainer! My son hasn’t been entirely persuaded to join me in my fitness journey yet, but he has commented about the change in my physique. So I hope that I’m planting seeds that will eventually bear fruit. 

I owe a debt of gratitude to the [Caliverse App](https://www.caliverse.app/), which I have used almost exclusively since May. Unfortunately it doesn’t come close to capturing the full depth of the RR in terms of progressions and variables around reps and sets, but it’s adequate for my needs. I have used it to progress from ordinary to diamond push ups. The pulling exercises are coming more slowly, but I have progressed from zero pull ups to 5 (albeit sometimes with a bit of kipping and imperfect form on the last rep), so I mostly focus on negatives or resistance band assisted. I’m stalled right now with an elbow injury (probably [Flexor Digitorum Superficialis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXjaCsUlrZs)), so I’m taking a full four weeks off of pulling. I blame myself for not properly stretching. I’m still hoping to find that perfect Apple Watch app that really captures all the depth of the RR, and I've searched the sub several times, but remain open to suggestions. I'd prefer to avoid the subscription model. 

I’m inspired by you all, from pros to beginners. Who knows: maybe there’s an L-sit in my future? We’ll see, but I am greatly enjoying the journey. My one piece of advice: don't give short shrift to warm-ups and stretching, as nothing has hindered my progress more than this injury. If any of you have other advice for 50+ folks who are late to the game I’d be grateful to hear it."

I started the RR back in August '16, the regular slow progress at first (negative pull ups and dips), then came the newbie gains - 5 pullups and even more dips, then the usual plateau with the progressions came. Then I changed up my routine to an upper/lower x2 / week thing, I didn't really track my sets&reps in a diary but I noticed that my reps still incrementally increased. Then life got busy and I skipped leg workouts, sometimes no workouts for a couple of weeks, you know, the usual cycle of ups and downs of life.

 1 year later I started cooking regularly for myself, which was the most impactful factor to my physique.

Anyone have progress slow due to mental health?,imyopushaman,619,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/e25dp0/anyone_have_progress_slow_due_to_mental_health/,1574805626.0,This has happened to me twice now near exactly the same time of progress. I'm 5'9 150lbs but probably have gone up 2 or 3 since then. I have just got back to my previous progress with weights and calisthenics and can see good progression once again. I find my motivation and discipline gone due to depression and anxiety leaving me tired and constant bad thoughts. Has anyone dealt with this while working out before this usually happens me 2 or 3 times a year other than that I have great motivation and discipline even when I dont feel like working out. I have tried psychologists multiple times but they never helped. I have never tried medication. Is this the way to go. I just heard that it can make you very tired and lazy which is the last thing I need. Does anyone else have any experience in this matter. Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks

I started doing the BWF primer routine around may, and the RR around august. Before that I was in my worst form ever (82kg with very high bf) and decided it was time to change. I've put in everything: a healthy diet with the advice of a specialist, 2-3 weekly workouts, PT to prevent injuries, and recently I also included daily creatine and protein shakes post workout.

Every change has been hard from the beginning, my entire body has hurt, and I'm still struggling to work out consistently, but today every effort has paid off. Now I'm 71kg, stronger than ever in my life and improving daily. I'm happy af! And the best thing is that I've shown my kids what you can get with effort and consistency.

I just wanted to thank this community, specially the people who designed these training programs. Thanks!"
"Yesterday, I built an in-ground pull up bar in my backyard with the help of one other person. With all of the conflicting information on the internet on how to build a bar, here's my experience + pics",thomaesthetics,612,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gt879l/yesterday_i_built_an_inground_pull_up_bar_in_my/,1590813639.0,"**EDIT**: a lot of people seem to be concerned about the flange-inside post method of construction I used. Today I completed my first workout on the bar (rings and bar itself) and the thing is rock solid sturdy. The bar didn’t make a sound, didn’t give in any way, and I feel very confident in how I built it. I have four 3.5 inch deck screws on each flange on the inside of the posts, and the flange orientation has the screws in a rotated square (diamond) position (top bottom left right). As someone pointed out in the comments, it’s highly unlikely that all 8 screws will fail at once, and I will have some time to notice them failing to go ahead and utilize “through post” construction and just run a longer bar through the posts themselves. 

Less than a week ago, I got the daring idea to install a [pull up bar](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAx1GIyDyWE/?igshid=1q1kpnugn37oj) in my backyard. After all these years of watching calisthenics influencers on their epic looking bars ([FitnessFAQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kGoGFsLi1Q) and [Brendan Meyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_08dtSwW714) bars from around 2014-15), I decided it was time to install my own.   

My main three reasons for wanting to do so were

*  the coronavirus lock down and the potential of a second wave, 
* the fact that come August I'll be commuting to school an hour there and back for architecture
*  and simply because I want a nice bar that's mine, to do more advanced calisthenics on.

After researching some different bar schematics and designs, I decided to fully commit to the plan and get this bar built. My first step was to **contact my Homeowner's Association** and ask for permission (which I highly recommend you do, if you're part of one) The last thing you want is to be digging your holes and have the president of your HOA drive by and say you can't do that). Thankfully she approved my request within the day and gave me the all clear. 

Next, I filled out an [811 request](https://call811.com/) to dig. Typically you call the number 811, but due to coronavirus, the wait time was almost 45 minutes and the online form usually clears you within a day. 

**You need to contact 811** before you dig so you don't hit a power/gas/water/telephone/internet line and potentially cause issues for the whole neighborhood, or yourself. Once they clear you, it's time to dig. 

My bar is a pretty typical design based on what I've seen online. Here are the specs:

* 12 ft posts
* 4 ft deep holes, 10 x 10 inches wide
* 8 ft of post above ground (perfect for hanging rings and for body clearance)
* 5 ft bar (5 ft in between posts)

I'm 5'8 and while many others would consider an 8 ft bar too tall, but I find it a perfect height. For the past 3 months during lockdown I've been working out on my doorway pullup bar and have had to bend my legs to do my reps. This bar gives me plenty of clearance and just requires a small jump to grab the bar. 

**Once I had the overall design laid out dimensionally,** I bought the materials. I had my girlfriend's brother help me with the whole experience and he also provided some tools, such as the power drill, the post hole diggers, shovels, and wheelbarrow.

* I went to my town's local lumber yard and bought two 6""x6""x12' pressure treated posts. The total cost of the posts with delivery (which was $50) was $108. That was awfully expensive for two posts, but I'm pretty sure that was due to it being from a local lumber yard. Each post there was $37, but at a Menards, Home Depot, or Lowes, you can find them for around $30 each, and if you can deliver them yourself, you've just saved a ton of money. 
* I then went to Menards and purchased a 1""x 5' galvanized steel threaded pipe, as well as two 1"" threaded steel floor flanges, to make up the bar itself. 
* I bought a post level ($6) and a normal straight 4' level ($13)
* I bought 8 bags of 60 lb concrete mix ($2.30/bag) 
* Some Rust-oleum enamel spray paint (white)
* Some deck screws
* One bag of general purpose gravel
* Four 2x4x8's ($3 each)

The Menards trip cost roughly $90.

**After the materials were purchased,** I cleaned off the galvanized pipe with some dish soap and dried it. I then spray painted it with the Rust-oleum to 1: prevent rust and help it survive the elements better, and 2: to keep it ""cool"" in the summer. White deflects light as opposed to black, which absorbs it. 

I sprayed the flanges white as well. From there, I marked out on the posts with a Sharpie where I was going to drill the flanges. I measured the flanges 8 inches down from the top of the post. We drilled the first flange into the post, and then screwed the pipe in. Then, I screwed the second flange into the other end of the pipe. If I didn't do it this way, the only way to thread the flange onto the bar was to rotate the entire 12 foot post around which we were NOT going to do!!!

Once the second flange was drilled into the second post, we now had the bar installed, and we also had the perfect distance between posts as to where to dig our holes. This worked **much better** than measuring 5 feet out on grass and then digging. 

**Speaking of digging**... here comes the fun part. The [rough rule of thumb](https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/landscaping-and-hardscaping/how-deep-should-dig-fence-posts) for digging post holes that I've learned is that you want the hole to be 1/3 the size of your post. Since my posts are 12', the holes were 4' deep. It took us roughly 2.5 hours to dig the 4 ft holes. We started the holes with a regular shovel, and made them roughly 10""x10"" so there was a decent amount of diameter around the posts once they were in. After digging about 6 inches with the shovels alone, the post hole diggers got us to around 2.5 feet deep. We hit some dead roots and a super annoying layer of clay. We used a bar digger to break up the hardened clay and keep the holes uniform. 

**Once we reached 4 ft,** we poured a light layer of gravel, and then we leveled. The way we leveled was by placing two 2x4x8's in the holes, and laying a third across the top like a bridge. Then we placed the straight level on the top plank, and boom. Easy hole leveling. We adjusted by pouring gravel as needed until the holes were equally deep. We wrapped chicken wire around the bottom of the posts that would go into the holes. Then we then raised the posts with the bar attached in the middle and pushed/slid the structure into the two holes. We quickly placed the 2x4x8's against the posts to keep them somewhat steady.

**Once the structure was erected,** we began mixing the concrete in the wheelbarrow and poured into the holes. I can't tell you how many bags were needed per hole because we would pour some concrete in one hole, and some in another, rather than 1 bag per hole etc. We DID end up needing to make one more trip to Menards to get 4 more bags of concrete, which cost another $13. We kept pouring until the concrete was flush with the grass, and we used the post level on all 4 corners of each post, at different heights to ensure that each post was perfectly straight. Then we drilled the sacrificial 2x4x8's from earlier diagonally into the posts to keep it braced overnight.  

After we made sure both posts were level, I then tried to see if the bar itself was level. This posed some weird results. First, using a straight level, in some cases, shows that the bar itself isn't level. UNTIL I move the level. It's very tricky trying to use a straight rectangular prism-esque level on a cylindrical bar. Then, I tried using the post level on the bar and that showed that it was MUCH more level than the straight level showed. It wasn't perfectly center, but it was still within the two lines on the clear water capsule.

**TO MY EYE AND TOUCH,** the bar literally seems perfectly level. This morning I used my iPhone level on it, and that shows that it IS indeed perfectly level. That being said, iPhones aren't fully perfect leveling tools either. My conclusion is that the bar is as good as it's going to get, and I would be insane to unscrew the flanges from the posts to try and correct possible 1 or 2 degrees of unevenness. I can assure you that every single bar I've used at gyms in the past, or various playgrounds and parks are not perfectly leveled, and are probably more crooked than mine now. 

It's been 24 hours since initially pouring the concrete, so I have one more day before I can seriously work out on it while it dries. I've hung from it here and there, and done a few explosive pull ups and the thing is unbelievably sturdy. I'm not kidding when I say that it honestly would've stayed still while in the empty holes. Those 6x6x12s are heavy af. The only way I can get it to ""shake"" is if I smack on it with some force. (I make sure that it's still level once I use it during the past 24 hours) 

**Conclusion:** I hope that this lengthy write up can shine some light on the subject of concrete-ing your own pull up bar in your yard. While I was looking for videos, tutorials and articles on how to build one, I found a huge amount of conflicting answers and methods to do things. I can now say from experience that the way I just described it worked, and now I have a sturdy bar that will hopefully last me for years to come. One final thing I will say is that you can POSSIBLY get by with just 4x4x12s (which would drastically cut the cost) but there may or may not be a varying degree of movement in the posts. 6x6 might be overkill, but it was that extra step that I personally was willing to take for a sturdier structure.

"A video illustrating many bodyweight leg exercises, from beginner to advanced to impossible, by Stefano Ravarino. Includes some very rare or never seen before variations.",RockRaiders,615,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/93933q/a_video_illustrating_many_bodyweight_leg/,1532992329.0,"One day I shared with Stefano Ravarino, a very strong street workout athlete, my post on the hardest bodyweight leg exercises, including illustrations for theoretical ones not yet unlocked ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8ayzij/updated_list_of_the_hardest_bodyweight_leg/)). Since then he trained hard for some of those progressions, and **he has made a video documenting a lot of leg exercises that require no weights, including some that were never done before and that he invented himself. [Here is his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIpsvNAT834).**

Note: **if you have weights, even sandbags which are very cheap, you can progress your leg strength or size more safely and efficiently**, but if you want to be able to train anywhere with almost no equipment or just want to challenge yourself with something new, some of these variations require only high strength, and are not limited by balance or mobility (while some others are less practical). **For the advanced bodyweight variations you should have healthy knees and progress gradually to let the knee tendons adapt to the stress. The post on the hardest leg exercises covers those points in more detail.**

**This video is not a tutorial, it documents many exercises sorted by difficulty without showing detailed progressions, form cues or warnings about possible risks. My post on the hardest exercises covers in more detail those points.** 

As a summary, of the hardest variations the sissy, advanced shrimp, quad blaster, Matrix and leg extension lever are quad dominant, the friction resisted one leg squats (called natural one leg press in the video) use both quads and glutes and the Nordic/natural leg curls, inverted squats and inverted natural leg curls are hamstring dominant. 

The main risks are shearing forces in the advanced quad exercises if done without previous conditioning, the natural one leg press is not suitable for people with meniscus problems, knee valgus/twisting must be avoided in all the exercises and is especially dangerous in one leg quad blaster, Matrix, sissy and leg extension lever variations. Also in leg curls adequate padding for the knees should be used, and some other exercises also require some padding for comfort.

**The purpose of this video was to show how there are progressions of all levels, including some that nobody has yet reached. Hopefully this provides some ideas on how to challenge the legs when only minimal equipment is available or inspires some of you to achieve cool new feats of leg strength. If you try the hardest variations be very cautious, some of them are dangerous while others are safe if built up to progressively.**"

**Useful related thread: [Technique Thursday - Horizontal Rows and Pulling](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/28jm7r/technique_thursday_horizontal_rows_and_pulling/).**

**PULLUPS AND ROWS IDEAS:**

You can buy yourself 100kg/220lbs of sand for around $5 and use a bag with a handle to do [one arm bent over rows](https://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/DBBentOverRow) and [pullovers](https://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/BBPullover) (you can do them on the floor if you lack a bench).  [Here](http://www.rosstraining.com/sandbagconstructionkit.pdf) is a guide on sandbags. Or just put books/water bottles/whatever.

For the ideas below, make sure the place you use can actually support your weight, you are responsible for your safety.

 A doorframe bar and rings are also excellent investments, especially the rings since there are so many places you can hang them. Or just get a long rope, you can throw it on a tree branch or other suitable overhang, probably even any streetlight pole, and do [rows](https://youtu.be/cIIzMEw0jA4?t=12s) and pullups, if you attach handles you also won't be limited by grip strength as much.


For rows there is the [doorframe bedsheet method](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/60q33b/using_the_bed_sheet_method_for_rows_and_pullups/) (be careful to avoid [getting trapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7ycs05/trapped_inside_my_room_with_the_door_stuck/)), [table rows](https://youtu.be/Y5a5pHN_xbY?t=16s), [swing set rows](https://youtu.be/wiSQ8yrTAKc?t=15s), [two chairs and a robust stick](https://youtu.be/-ymRTZS6zw4?t=10s) (if you have a wide grip so it's close to the chairs the stick can be less robust, but it's better to have a good stick), [chairs alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68Yaq0-ITgw), can also work for full range tuck front lever rows. Also some low bars outside.

With any overhang if you are strong enough you can do tuck front lever rows, the [piked version](https://youtu.be/Kks4O-p1dh0?t=2m21s) is the easiest one allowing full range of motion, do it with hands together and a false grip to make it easier to get as close as possible to touching the bar with the torso. If you have a ceiling in the way you would have to be able to do it from an advanced tuck at least.

Places for pullups (and front lever rows if suitable): [the bedsheet method](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/60q33b/using_the_bed_sheet_method_for_rows_and_pullups/), [pullup handles](http://rosstraining.com/blog/2016/07/05/doorway-pull-up-handles-2/), [wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRDEJYqLmfc), branches, soccer crossbar, playground equipment like monkey bars, any bar or ledge that's high enough to at least allow you to do them with the knees tucked to the chest, even wide grip if the place is really low. [Many places are suitable](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pullups+places). 

To progress rows you can change the incline, use archer or one arm progressions or extend the body in the front lever variations or add weight. To progress pullups you can do them in a hollow body or tucked or full l-sit to make the bottom part harder, you can pull higher with the end level being [waist high](https://youtu.be/Vkn1_sLEl0w?t=49s), you can add weight, you can do unilateral progressions where you pull more with one arm than the other, and eventually one arm pullups.

**HORIZONTAL PULLING (REVERSE PUSHUP):**

The [reverse pushup](https://youtu.be/cszJcRz5UB0?t=2m17s) on chairs for maximum range of motion. It is like an [inverted row](https://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BWSupineRow)'s top half but with no contribution from the forearms for grip or biceps, brachialis and brachioradialis for elbow flexion. Almost everyone has two chairs, right? You can also use two (same video at 4:06) [rolled carpets](https://youtu.be/cszJcRz5UB0?t=4m6s) or stacks of books to get that ROM. It will also be slightly harder because you'll be more horizontal. The [floor only version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCIAdZ_nwI0&feature=youtu.be) is better than nothing but really short ROM.

Use some padding if they feel hard on the elbows on a hard surface.

**Progression:** 

Ass on the ground -> In a [tabletop bridge](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7dwu5H6c_0/maxresdefault.jpg), which would be the counterpart of knee pushups -> straddle (optional) -> straight body -> weighted -> from a [forearm fully compressed reverse planche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrNTTN77648), this is a big jump, if you are so committed you'll probably have found a way to do real rows by then -> from less tucked forearm reverse planches until full lay ([image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qQ-9GEmWzcQ/hqdefault.jpg), [video](https://youtu.be/gp9nu2DHLxo?t=1m30s)). New: [actual full lay dynamic version](https://youtu.be/HuiLLCoQls8?t=1m28s).

Edit: thanks to u/ongew for several good suggestions to progress after straight body reverse pushups:

* [Rear deltoid iron cross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hto3Gfw7KU0&t=256s). It increases the load on them because they are the main muscle in shoulder transverse extension. It also uses triceps for elbow extension. Even ass on the ground is hard, then you may be able to use the previously mentioned steps to make it easier to achieve the compressed forearm reverse planche. The [wall version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtRDHs6nTZ0) can be a regression.
* [Assisted forearm Victorian/reverse planche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MM2WdiIfCU&t=24s), which is sort of a top position of a reverse pseudo-planche pushup. You can do it dynamically.
* Candlestick raises (next exercise in the video above). They are a progression towards the dragon press (tuck, advanced tuck, etc. until [full lay](https://youtu.be/XHkwaMaauro?t=2m23s)), you can do it dynamically instead of just the hardest bottom part to stimulate more gains. It's an intermediate to advanced rear deltoid and tricep exercise, full lay is around front lever difficulty. 

Edit: more ideas from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9cas5d/back_exercises_using_just_the_floor_and_a_wall/) by u/1ddf25567f4df451:

* [Wall face pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGgqEXEwaqI&feature=youtu.be&t=35s), they can be progressed by changing the incline or straightening the arms like the rear delt iron cross.
* [L to V sit raise](https://youtu.be/yHUrQAhs-6c?t=9s), ideally extending the shoulders until the torso is parallel to the floor (like a manna or tucked reverse planche). If these get easy they could be scaled into reverse planche raises (straighten the legs at the top or start on two chairs with a straight body through the entire execution).
* [Manna wall slides](https://youtu.be/oVYAl9R5h0M?t=2m58s), can get a lot of range of motion but require high strength.

Other similar exercises that are static only are discussed below (""problems"" section).

**[Muscles used](https://www.exrx.net/Lists/Articulations):** 

Rear deltoids and triceps long head(shoulder extension and hyperextension), lower and middle traps, rhomboids (scapular retraction), lats (shoulder depression and extension), spinal erectors (to avoid back rounding), abs and glutes (posterior pelvic tilt and straight lower back), hamstrings slightly to prevent the knees from hyperextending. Note that since the shoulder is mostly extending behind the body line (hyperextension), the lats and chest work much less than in full range inverted rows. For other stabilizers used check the ""inverted row"" link above, keep in mind the elbow flexors and forearms don't work here. All the tricep heads work in dragon presses and rear delt crosses as elbow extensors.

**Problems:**

The main problem of this progression is that the range of motion is limited and after the straight body version there is a HUGE jump in difficulty to the ""floating"" version. You can also do an isometric only version on the floor, progressing towards forearm or straight arms reverse planche leans and holds or dragon presses. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7spycu/pulling_strength_on_a_featureless_plane_with_zero/) contains more info on those harder variations.

If you think there's a practical way to do unilateral or wide or pseudo-reverse planche reverse pushups, suggest your ideas in the comments.

**VERTICAL PULLING (FLOOR PULLOVER):**

The [floor pullover](https://youtu.be/DyoUqDzpVko?t=1m37s), a precise imitation of the [dumbbell/barbell pullover](https://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/LatissimusDorsi/BBPullover). If your wrists are injured, you can do it on forearms, so the starting position will be a [forearm plank](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-N9tjvL7HAmo/UnADv5KWa3I/AAAAAAAABhA/6vbeLXUs-nk/s600/plank.JPG) and the ending a [forearm extended plank](http://www.armanniluca.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Extended-plank-e1454677628400.jpg), you can extend until the head almost touches the ground. You can slide at the hands/forearms or at the knees/feet, using a furniture slider, towel, ab wheel, basketball etc., anything that reduces friction. The difficulty will vary depending on the amount of friction of the material you use to roll/slide.

**Progression:**

Doing it on hips could work if you are weak, but it's probably much better to just work on planks or forearm planks until you can stay slightly extended and you'll be strong enough for sure. -> knee pullover (like in Jeff's video) -> straddle -> straight body on feet -> one arm on knees (if it's hard to make the jump, work on one arm extended planks or weighted straight body pullovers) -> straddle one arm -> one arm on feet -> weighted one arm, but by now have you really not invested in a way to do actual pullups?

**Muscles used:** 

Lats, chest, triceps long head (shoulder extension), abs and glutes (posterior pelvic tilt, straight lower back), quads (minor role in the straight body version to extend the knees), other stabilizers (check the ""barbell pullover"" link above).

**Problems:**

This exercise progression is actually pretty good, very similar to dumbbell/barbell pullovers, the only difference being more core engagement. If you have criticisms write them down below.

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:**

**Shoulder depression:** if you claim a weak development of shoulder depression is a problem with these progressions, just incorporate L-sits into your routine and you'll be fine.

**Biceps:** these two floor exercises don't use the biceps. A simple alternative is putting some stuff in a bag and doing some curls at the end of the workout. 

If you put your hands on chairs, you can do [pelican curls](https://youtu.be/5NGADQQXRAs?t=6s) (the part from 0:06 of the video/bottom of a deep pushup to the straight arm part). The straight body version is very hard, so these can be progressed from the knees, with slow negatives or partial range at first.

Without equipment, [crawling/sliding floor pullups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWzI5yWLAZI) have some elbow flexion and can be progressed with more friction or on one arm, but they are not very convenient unless you like being a human scrubber and keeping your floor clean by working out. 

Planche leans and planche progressions, especially with hands turned back, will build your biceps in their fully stretched positions since with locked arms they oppose elbow dislocation. Be careful if you progress through straight arm strength, increase the lean gradually and slow down if you start feeling elbow discomfort.

Just finished 1000 push-ups for in a week for the first time ever,SuaveUchiha,615,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10hih1z/just_finished_1000_pushups_for_in_a_week_for_the/,1674274835.0,"This past November I decided to get a jump start on my New Year’s resolution of starting to work out so I’d have a better chance of keeping it up. Decided to start doing push-up’s at work since all we do is sit most of the time. 

I started out doing 10 an hour for every shift, so basically 80 a day. The first month was brutal and I got a lot of joint pain in my elbows so I started to add in some arm stretches before every set and the difference showed in a few days, much less soreness throughout the day. After a month, I would add 5 to each set, so 10 an hour for a month, then 15, then 20. This week was my first full (work) week of sets of 25 and I just finished my 1000th push-ups before I wrote this.

I feel accomplished but also don’t know if this is even considered a lot for someone who works out regularly. My goal is to reach 200lbs total body weight by adding on muscle to my arms. I’m 5’10”, 190lbs as of now with a small gut from eating extra calories for bulking. Admittedly my solar plex is firm as hell now though and I can do that thing bodybuilders do where they can make their stomach really big or really small/flat. Now that I’ve reached this milestone, I’m wondering what to move on to or add to this routine.

Just wanted to share my goal and get some feedback/advice or answer questions."
Body weight exercises vs weight lifting. Kind of a newbie question.,samuraidogparty,613,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/o04t9e/body_weight_exercises_vs_weight_lifting_kind_of_a/,1623728391.0,"I’ve spent the past year doing what I always did in my 20s—heavy weights. I mostly lift heavy in my home gym, especially while trapped at home all last year and needing an outlet. My coworker, who has no gym, he’s just been doing body weight exercises. We’ve both made progress and changed our physique which is to be expected.

But we were talking today and we don’t really understand the physiology of it all. Say, for squats. If I do 3 sets of 8 at the heaviest I can to complete the set, does that work different muscles than if I did 5 sets of 30 body weight squats? Or does it work the same muscles, but differently? Or is there really no difference at all?

I’m genuinely curious, and wondering if there’s a benefit to doing one over the other (or both)? I tried Googling this first, but it mostly just gave me results of lifting routines and not an explanation of the physiology behind it all. Any insight would be awesome."

[Photos prior to gyms closing](https://imgur.com/a/1feArte), only one I could find, from prior to lockdown while travelling. I was around 170lbs in this photo.  Sorry for the blurry photo, but my phone is a bit old, and I didn't take any progress pics right before starting my program.

[Physique at the end of the 12 weeks](https://imgur.com/a/gFZXBci).

Covid-19 strikes, gyms close, and I was left with fears of my physique shriveling up. Dumbbells were sold out instantaneously, and living in a small apartment I have no room for a home gym setup. I floundered at first, having trained exclusively inside the gym for the past few years, knowing only basic bodyweight training  such as pullups and pushups. It took some time and research to develop a routine that I could do at home, and would enjoy. Luckily for me I live walking distance from one of those [outdoor workout parks](https://imgur.com/a/dMF5jmZ).  I'd like to share this routine with you in the event that another lockdown occurs in your country, and you are forced to make do with little equipment as I was.

All I had was an [exercise band, dumbbells weighing 30lbs on each handle](https://imgur.com/a/GRmJGEW), access to a pull-up and low bar, and a dip bar.

* **Sundays**– Absolute rest day, no cardio or exercising
* **AMRAP**\-As many reps as possible, leaving one rep in the tank
* **MyoRep**– Perform the first two full sets, then take only 15 seconds rest between remaining three
* **Failure**\-For these exercises I was constrained by the weight I had, so went to failure attempting to beat my previous reps whenever possible
* **Rep Target**– Whenever I could beat a rep target in all of the sets, I added weight or moved to a harder progression.
* **Strength Gains**\- This program is not designed for strength building. You would likely gain some, but the volume and reps lend themselves better to size gains.

I based this Routine off of my training in the gym, substituting exercises as best I could. In researching exercises, I used the[ bodyweightfitness subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index), and the great website by [Antranik](https://antranik.org/rr/).  I don’t proclaim to be even close to the expert he is, so you should be able to find some great advice from him.

If trying this routine, pick an exercise progression that falls roughly into the rep range. For adding weight to exercises, throw some dumbbells into a backpack. I generally kept my reps one away from complete failure, until the last set of an exercise. If you are more of a beginner lifter, or even early intermediate, I would cut 1 set off of all of the major exercises( Pullup, Pushup, Row, Dip, or Hand Stand Pushup) to give your body time to adjust.

The weight used were much lighter than I’m used to, as well as having a lighter bodyweight, so I found recovery to be much easier. Therefore I was training large muscle groups 3x a week, and smaller groups more frequently. The basic plan was 5 days lifting, one dedicated cardio day, and one dedicated rest day. I also sprinkled cardio in throughout the week whenever I could, to make up for movement I was lacking working from home.

I placed a focus on hitting the muscles I don’t isolate as in the gym, such as forearms and neck. Note that your leg training may suffer slightly, as I find they require heavier weights to maintain and grow.

## My Results

The routine lasted me 12 weeks, where my province closed down gyms ( While keeping restaurants open most of the time). During those 12 weeks I took two deloads, whenever my life got too hectic and I felt worn out. I would recommend not running this program more than 5 weeks consecutively without a deload, as the volume is fairly high. If you begin to feel rundown, take a deload. There is absolutely no shame in that.

My main goal with this routine was maintaining my gains while the gym was closed, and cutting some bodyfat. I dropped from around 171lbs, to 159lbs. I lost a little thickness in the musculature on my inner back, traps, and legs that I attribute to lack of heavy squats, deadlifts and shrugs. Overall I found the routine did a commendable job holding the [muscle even with a caloric deficit](https://imgur.com/a/gFZXBci). My core actually looks the best it ever has, due to the lever training. Now that gyms are reopened, I am in a great spot to regain the muscle I lost and surpass my all time best physique. My forearms thickened nicely and gained a load of vascularity, which was a nice change as they have always been a weakpoint.

## Substitutions

If you don’t have dumbbells, try to get your hand on a heavy exercise band. You can order one [online ](https://www.sportchek.ca/categories/shop-by-sport/fitness/resistance.html?lastVisibleProductNumber=8)at almost any fitness store. If you don’t have access to a pullup bar, and there is none at a local park near you, I see two options. Either purchase a [doorway bar](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B002YQUP7Q?slotNum=17&ots=1&ascsubtag=[artid|2139.a.19546882[src|[ch|[lt|&linkCode=gs2&imprToken=0ebc1e9b-7a21-f187-36a&tag=hearstmagazin-20), or find a treebranch or part of a building you can do pullups off of. They are an non negotiable part of training your back, and you won’t succeed without it. Combining a band with dumbbells also works if the weights you have are too light.

## Conclusion

The gyms being closed down are no excuse to not train hard. If you are serious about your fitness, disciplined, and focused on self improvement you will find a way to workout. I found myself walking to the outdoor gym near my house many times during -25 degree Celsius weather, asking myself what the hell I was doing. But on arrival, and after my first few sets as my body warmed up, the familiar glow of a good training session made it all worth it. You may have lost access to your gym, but you haven’t lost the ability to maintain or improve your physique."
Building my own outdoor calisthenics gym,Kai--,613,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gwbkpn/building_my_own_outdoor_calisthenics_gym/,1591250761.0,"Hey all, I've been dreaming about it for a while since starting calisthenics seriously 2 years ago and I've finally done it (with a lot of help from my best friend and my dad). summarized info first, then some details below that.

[picture album link](https://imgur.com/a/Dl5oyco)

[Total Costs: $560](https://imgur.com/a/ZnbEizj)

(I'll add Length, Width, Height dimensions later as I forgot to measure that and it is night time)

Includes: pull up bar, parallel bars, and a bar for nordic curls.

m/26/5'3""

So I've lurked a lot of posts online about how other people have built their pull up bars and what-not and I knew I wanted one that was compact, that could hang my rings, and include a bar for nordic curls. My family's yard had space, although I didn't need much. The products used for the project is linked above in the Total Costs. The whole structure is extremely sound and my plan moving forward is to paint the posts, maybe put some anti-rusting agents on the bars (I live in Seattle and it's humid), and restoring the ground, getting some health back into the dirt and planting grass.

Summarized Method:

* Plan layout, buy materials, call the city before you dig, clean area, check the weather.
* Dig holes (2 holes were 3 feet deep, 3 holes were 2.5 feet deep).
* Prop treated wooden post up and fill with concrete, constantly check with leveling tool to keep up-right. Repeat for other posts, making sure they are in line with layout plan and facing same direction as other posts.
* Drill holes into wood using spade drill bits, insert pipes and thread floor flange on. Drill holes, then drill in flat head phillip wood screws (2.5"" in length)

This is basically my first DIY project ever of this size and I rarely every pick up a hammer so my dad's wisdom helped tremendously on this one. These are the things that I've learned.

* 4""x4"" and 6""x6"" actually means 3.5"" x 3.5"" and 5.5"" x 5.5"" inches
* quikrete **floor surfacer** is not the same as concrete for wooden posts and is a lot, lot, lot more expensive (I made the mistake of buying 5 of these, 3 of which went into the first 6x6)
* Getting your dimensions and layouts right the first time saves you multiple trips to the hardware store.
* Always check the leveling tool, and the right-angle tool, we even got creative with string on wooden stakes to make sure certain heights were matching up from post to post. After we drilled holes on the posts some holes weren't wide enough and we had to widen the holes not just to get the pipes through but to get the pipe to meet the other post exactly where we wanted it.
* Digging is hard, but thankfully my buddy had a tool just for it. It's a giant metal rod that must weight around 30  -  40 lbs with a wedge at one end. It digs straight down, then we dig out the dirt with a shovel.
* When it comes to conventional concrete, make sure your water to mix ratio is correct. When using post concrete, put one bag at a time and water after each bag.
* flanges were meant to be on the floor with the pipe coming out the nipple side, but we had the flanges on the outside of the posts with the pipe coming through the opposite side. It made the posts a lot sturdier, but threading through was a little tricky at times.
* Always get more than you need, it'll save you trips to the store and you can always return what you don't use.
* Double check your measurements. Make sure you really know how high you want your pull up bar. I also had to decide on the height of my dip bars, and the bar for my nordic curls. That said, I definitely made changes as I physically saw the posts built. As for the pipes, I had to go back to the hardware store to get them cut and re-threaded because some lengths just didn't add up.

That's it! It was a 5 day project, 1 for planning and 4 for the hard labor. If you have any questions, please ask away. Big thanks for this community as I've gotten a lot of inspiration from other people's home-made gyms, most recently u/thomaesthetics for his detailed post last week."

Pull-Ups Versus Chin-Ups Versus Neutral Grip Versus Rope Pull-Up Study Summary,DoomGoober,608,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7b6lt3/pullups_versus_chinups_versus_neutral_grip_versus/,1509988958.0,"http://www.thejpd.org/article/S1050-6411(16)30297-8/fulltext

Summary:

* The only statistically significant difference in muscle activation caused by grip changes was middle trapezius activation. Pronated and rope pull-ups activate middle trap more than neutral or chin-up grip.

* Regardless of grip, eccentrics (negatives) have significantly less activation of brachioradialis, biceps brachii and pectoralis major than concentrics (positives) to the point that the activation may be too low to trigger adaption. Middle trapezius, latissimus dorsi and infraspinatus all activate at similar levels for both eccentric and concentric. This brings into question the common advice that negatives are a good way to learn pull-up type motions as they exclude many of the required muscles required for concentrics.

TL;DR: Grip doesn't matter except for your middle trap. Negatives may only strengthen SOME of the muscles required for pull-up type motions.

EDIT: Rope pull-up is a pull-up performed on two vertical ropes with knots on the bottom hanging from a pull-up bar, shoulder width apart. I have actually never seen this in any gym and had assumed they were using 1 rope climbing rope.

EDIT2: Great discussion in the comments! My conclusions, in particular, are being questioned especially for beginners, so please read the comments and draw your own conclusions.

EDIT3: This 2010 study has slightly different results: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21068680 Unfortunately, I can only find the abstract for free. And here's a PDF for another study of towel vs traditional vs suspension (TRX handles with short straps that can rotate): https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/hukin.2017.58.issue-1/hukin-2017-0068/hukin-2017-0068.pdf. It found the exact same results: mid trap was the only muscle that saw difference based on grip."
7 month RR body progress (skinny fat) and how it changed my life,BillybobJuniorman,612,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/zetqbk/7_month_rr_body_progress_skinny_fat_and_how_it/,1670393187.0,"So a little context, until 7 months ago I had absolutely no experience with lifting or body weight training in any way shape or form except for the one or two mandatory weight lifting sessions in highschool. Throughout my whole life i've been pretty skinny fat, I had no muscle on me at all and I had trouble holding myself accountable to stay consistent. Then one day I got sick of how I looked and decided to get ahold of myself and start working out no matter how I felt. 

Originally I ran a full body program 3x a week for the first 4 months but I found that it was way too exhausting on my body. Instead I switched to an upper lower x2 split and I found that I had been making a lot more progress due to the nature of having more rest time and from then on I've been having great experiences with bodyweight training. Aside from physical changes, the mental benefits have been great too. Being able to take my shirt off without feeling self concious or just feeling more confident in my own skin for once was a great feeling and to this day it gives me my drive to keep going. I found that my mood has overall improved and I feel more inclined to spend time spreading positivity instead of being in my own head about my looks/body. 

I'm really glad I found this subreddit and got into bodyweight training because I feel like even though its only been half a year it has really changed my life and I'm really excited for whats coming up next in my journey.

This pretty much holds all the information I wish I had when I started training with single leg exercises only. Don't get me wrong there are great articles and videos out there but most lack the information on how to make progress and how to create workouts

I did some digging on how one should structure leg workouts in terms of training volume and exercise selection for muscle & strenght gain.

I also made a calculator for you so you can compare the bodyweight and weighted single leg squat exercises to back squat.  And I also created a leg workout template so you can create your own workouts.

If you don't want click any links here is a short summary about the subject:

 

You will learn:

* General recommendations for weekly training volume. What is required to grow and make gains?
* Single leg squats vs back squat. How to compare?
   * Loading the single leg squat and comparing the load to a back squat
   * Ways to load single leg squats
   * Free calculator to compare the loaded single leg squat and back squat
* How to get the most out of your bodyweight training?
   * What to do when you reach +20 reps?
* Bodyweight and weighted single leg squat exercises
* Example training programs
   * Plus a free leg workout planner

 Summary:

* Typically 9-15sets per week will make good progress
* Do most of your workout volume in the 5-10rep range. For example 6-8 and 8-10 range for most exercises
* Train legs 1-2 times per week
* Single leg squats equals back squatting around 0.95 times your bodyweight leading to high rep count when you get to the intermediate level.
* When doing high rep training (+10reps per set) do all sets to muscular failure or 1 reps close to failure. It's hard to tell when you truly hit your max reps on your high rep sets so training to failure or very close to it indicates sufficient effort
* If you wish to do more than 9sets per week divide your workout into two sessions. For example 6sets per workout (3+3sets). This will provide 12 weekly sets. Don’t do too much training in a single session and limit the amount of work to about 10sets at max per session
* Deload every 4-8 weeks depending on your recovery ability. Drop the training volume by 50% for a week by doing less sets. I don´t generally prefer lowering the training load during a deload week. But if you feel your joints need some extra rest you can drop the training load for a week doing lighter pump work."

"""Coach"" Christopher Sommers of Gymnastic Bodies - A review",cmciccio,610,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5fcow6/coach_christopher_sommers_of_gymnastic_bodies_a/,1480351837.0,"First off, some context for this review. I’m a former GB student, I started with the program when it first launched. I’ve been to two seminars and I have trained directly with several of Christopher’s top athletes. My username on the forum, before I was banned, was ‘thecolin’ (just so ‘Coach’ knows where he can direct his lawyers).

The first thing to address is, why talk about the person and not the program? While this may seem like pure character assassination, you need to first understand that the contents of ‘the program’ (let’s not refer to it by name, I don’t want to get sued after all!) are slim. By his own design, the entire program operates around him, his chosen elite, his seminars and the forum. It’s impossible to talk about ‘the program’ without talking about the man at the center. Without him, all you would have would be a long list of fairly generic gymnastic conditioning exercises, common stretches and basic plyometrics in a slick package.

He has always attempted to position himself as the alpha and the omega of gymnastics information, a conscious decision on his part, with many interlocking layers of resources that you need to pay to see. As such, I feel that talking about him directly is not only fair, but necessary.

Additionally, Christopher has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t want anyone talking about ‘the program’ in less than perfectly favorable terms. So in order to educate people about how his company runs, I see no other possibility than to talk about him directly.

I haven’t been involved with ‘the program’ in a fairly long time now. And I had no intention of publishing my opinions after my departure. But after reading about Christopher’s latest tantrum, I realized that there are still many people being seduced by his slick marketing and I think people should understand exactly what they’re getting into.

I know it’s quite popular to throw the word narcissist around these days, labeling anyone who has ever taken a selfie as self-obsessed.  But as someone who has never had this tendency to use the term casually, I can think of no other way to more aptly and succinctly describe this man.

It’s interesting to note that Christopher has relatively little knowledge of physiology and training adaption. This is the opinion of several intelligent and educated people in the bodyweight fitness community who have worked closely with him. Like I’ve said, his programs are fairly generic list of gymnastics exercises (this in turn is the opinion of several talented gymnasts I’ve spoke with, who are also well known members of the community. Unfortunately I haven’t gotten anyone’s approval to talk about them by name).

As such, he has a very limited capacity on an individual basis to help students exceed their problems. The overwhelming thrust of the training approach that he pushes is that anyone who is not excelling needs to work harder, work harder, work harder.

This is the first point at which I had my doubts, and started to question what lied behind the curtain and what actually controlled the giant flaming head that is Christopher Sommers. 

When I first started to question the program I was waking up before 5am to train most days of the week. I was following the program exactly as it was presented. At a certain point I had dramatically exceeded my ability on a mobility element that was supposed to aid with the ROM on an associated progression within the program, but this simply wasn’t happening. When I started to ask about this on the forum, the response was simply to ‘work harder’. I honestly couldn’t contemplate how that would have been possible at the time. What I now know is that Christopher never provides these answers because he simply doesn’t have any insights on a personal basis.

I had already attended my first seminar. I had noticed that everything was set up very broadly and by the numbers, with little to no comments on the individual attendees. But I hadn’t given it excessive thought as it was introductory and after training alone at 5am in my unheated garage all winter, training with other people was a welcome change!

To his credit some of these flawed progressions were eventually modified and corrected. But in his pathological inability to admit fault, the current contents of the program are always ‘correct’. The flawed program as it was originally presented was not at fault, people’s laziness was the problem. If there is a problem, it is silently modified without any kind of announcement, seemingly pretending that it has always been like that. But he appears to have the idea that if part of his program doesn’t work for 99% of his students, it’s because 99% of his students are too stupid or lazy to figure this out. This is obviously nonsense.

By focusing on ‘hard work’, he can position himself perfectly to be beyond criticism. Nobody can deny the important of consistent hard work in attaining fitness goals. So it’s an excellent point of rhetoric for him to lean on. In practical terms, it means that he will simply gloss over anyone who has genuine limitations in their training, as everyone does to some degree or another, and never allow it to become a comment on his allegedly perfect system.

While it’s positive to focus on hard work, in practice it creates an environment where everyone who doesn’t succeed is lazy unless you injure yourself, then you’ve pushed yourself too much…

But this also works to his advantage, as Christopher’s true capacities lie in identifying talent. While the mantra is always ‘hard work conquers all’ he has also stated quite plainly that he is so adept at identifying talent that when new children came into his gym in Arizona, all he’d have them do is have them run forwards, and run backwards. From that simple test he already had a good idea of what their potential was. Of course if he were to speak more plainly about individual limitations in such a specialized sport, it would limit his ability to (quite literally) sell the fantasy of ‘the crucible of sport’, personal glory and ‘willpower conquers all’.

By selling this story to a wide enough audience he can discard anyone who struggles and pick out the talent. And anyone who questions him will be ignored, as he can simply point to one of his (obviously hard working, but obviously talented) athletes and say that they’re his creation, molded from raw clay with his very hands.

What he does have is a world class understanding of technical gymnastics and an ability to train children. In terms of training adults, his approaches are brutish at best.

You’ll notice that all the good, detailed information comes from his top athletes and affiliates, not from him. He even went so far as to create a wiki on the forum (I’m unsure if it’s still there) in response to the complete lack of course content. Effectively requiring students who had paid for the course to also be the authors of the content!

And he is ruthless in organizing his stable of athletes. The number of talented, intelligent and interesting people he has exorcised from the community because they have dared to disagree with him is ridiculously long. People who he cannot control are quickly expunged. I think many of the more high profile instances of this are well known.

This anti-social behavior is in stark contrast to his impressive charisma and presence in person. He’s an accomplished salesman, and to anyone who has met him, calling him ‘anti-social’ sounds odd indeed. But it’s this contrast between his charisma and his apparent inability to maintain long term relationships that is so troubling. These are the kinds of people that can be so insidiously toxic.

There is no doubt that he’s in this for money and personal glory. Despite my growing doubts, I decided to attend a second seminar. I thought that with more experience perhaps I could get some more information that I hadn’t caught previously. Unfortunately I was already becoming a slightly vocal critic and had started to look for information from other sources, including from someone that he had already cast out from his circle.

Though he never would call me out by name, I can only imagine it was my less than complete support and ‘fraternizing with the enemy’ that led to him going on an hour long rant about how much money he is making and how successful he is. It was freaking surreal and completely unprecedented, according to some of his staff.

Bear in mind that this is an hour of time from a high priced seminar for people wanting to learn about gymnastics training. But he went on and on about how he’s raking in cash. The new Porsche he bought in cash, and that even though he’s stuck in traffic in his fancy new car, the fact that he owns it signifies to everyone else that he’s ‘won’ (won what, I don’t know). It’s the first time I’ve ever encountered such overtly shallow materialism in person.

The seminar itself was more of the same, a variety of exercises that could be passed on in a 1 minute video and lots of speeches about working harder, pushing yourself more, and working harder. If you pay attention, you’ll notice that although he makes a lot of good speeches, he starts to repeat himself constantly.

Having said all that, I enjoyed my time with the program. There are a lot of smart people that have floated around him from time to time. The community is generally excellent, though it is moderated with an extremely heavy hand. When I was there posts were regularly modified and deleted by the moderators and people were banned, often for petty and selfish reasons.

I got decent results for my own standards and learned a fair bit, but it takes a massive amount of extra work to get anywhere or to understand what you need to do.

Gymnastics style training is a very complicated thing to train. And if he were more modest in his proclamations, providing more help and understanding around the potential pitfalls that everyone eventually faces the program would be far superior. While ‘the program’ provides a useful resource of exercises, expect to pay a lot of money for the information, along with many hours of extra work to figure ways around problems and sticking points.

Before the lock down I was a regular gym goer and train boxing a few times a week. When lock down started I let myself go majorly, drinking heavy and eating shit while non active so I quickly gained weight/fat.

I'll be honest this last few months have been a complete mindset shift. Functional/Bodyweight training is extremely effective and I've seen the best results I've ever had for my aim of body composition & sport specific fitness. I've monitored this subreddit for awhile and the content/advice i see regularly posted is invaluable so thank you all. All i needed to do was put in the work!

**Profile**

6ft 2

Before: 188lbs

After: 179lbs

Anyway he's before/after pics over a period of just under 8 weeks. I had started working out again around mid-late March but didn't have any photos at the time.

[https://imgur.com/a/SmLA30B](https://imgur.com/a/SmLA30B)

**Diet**

My diet has been very good throughout, I consistently get 180g-210g protein everyday. I started on around 2200 cal per day and I'm down to 1900/2000 currently. I weigh myself regularly and tweak this number based on the scales, but the most I would want to lose per week is around 1.5lbs. The biggest thing I've done is cut out alcohol completely. I take a photo every week for comparison purposes and I can definitely see the differences!

**Routine**

My routine is based around Ross Enamait's Never Gymless which I got for 1$. I also incorporate exercises from RR.

Its basically this:

**Day 1**\- 15-20min Integrated Circuit Training - This is for Strength & Conditioning

**Day 2** \- Strength - 7/8 different strength exercises paired into groups of 2 usually one upper one lower to reduce training time. I don't have a pull-up bar as my landlord wouldn't allow it so I have to jog to the local park for these. The climbing frame bars I use are at an incline so I have to keep switching sides to avoid imbalances.

When I started I could barely do 3-4 assisted pistol squats on a chair holding to the side. Now I do 4x10 reps holding a 6 kg medicine ball.

Started with 5x 3-4 BW pullups, now at 6x 5-6 weighted pull-ups with strict form. My circuits often include pull-ups on other days so I get plenty of volume.

**Day 3** \- 15-20min Enhanced Interval Training - Big focus on strength endurance.

**Day 4** \- Strength - Explosive/Pylometric focus. I use my weighted vest for the pylometric exercises.

**Day 5** \- 5km run (Or rest). Practice some exercises which I want to improve on this day for low reps also. (Chair Elevated Pike Press, Handstand, Pistol Squat). Went from 8min mile to 6.30min.

Additional: Core workouts (alternating/constantly mixing up) every other day. Foundation Training 12 minute exercise on core days.

With my strength workouts I've basically used RR progressions & added exercises from RR. So far I've had one actual rest day. I listen to my body and if and when needed will have a day off.

**Equipment**

* Weighted vest filled with sand to max capacity (its roughly 11-12kg).
* 2 heavy duty 41inch resistance bands about mid resistance.
* Ab wheel
* 6 & 12kg medicine ball
* Stretch resistance band (cable?) with door stopper attachment & handle attachments.
* Head strap for weighted neck exercise

I do plan on re-joining the gym when they re-open without restrictions for barbell dead-lift and clean & press exercises for my explosive strength days. As it stands I feel like i'm limited for explosive strength exercises and I have extra in the tank after these sessions.

**Advice needed**

1. The RR is strength training 3 x per week. My current routine incorporates strength training 2x per week. Can I still make progressions or do I need to add more volume?
2. For pike press elevated from chair I've been following Antranik blog advice. However, I feel like I'm not progressing. I can do 6x reps for my first set then around 4-5 reps for the remaining 3 sets. I've got video but having trouble uploading to imugr? When I can figure this out I will post it for form feedback. But does this go back to my first question?
3. There is nowhere suitable for dips (even at the park), how much of a disadvantage am I at by neglecting these? As a substitute I am currently pressing myself up a high climbing frame immediately after pull-ups in the hope it somehow mimics the same movements of a muscle up (which I want to aim towards).
4. I used to have access to a barbell with 20kgs for rows & use bands for added resistance. I no longer have access to the barbell and I haven't really done incline rows since because I'm scared of breaking the door and when I do them they seem to ""easy"". Should I do them regardless or am I getting enough back work with just pullups/facepulls?
5. Standing wheel roll-outs - I've added weight to a backpack whilst doing kneeling ab roll-outs which is really testing but when I last tried a standing wheel roll-out I struggled to lift myself back to starting position. I feel like even using a wall to reduce the range isn't helping much?
6. Diet - I'm in a calorie deficit (around 300-400) and as I've lost fat I'm slightly concerned about how skinny I'm starting to look due to the lack of lean muscle. I have fat still around my abdomen which is very stretchy but I'm hoping I can lose. In my head i was going to cut further till this is tighter and then start a small surplus to help strength progression & gain muscle. Is this good logic?
7. I was thinking of buying rings, do you just find a high branch and wrap it over? Is it that simple and valuable to use? Also, I'm trying to figure out how to make some DIY parallel bars - any suggestions?
8. I believe I have quite a few muscle imbalances. For example, when i do any hinge exercises I cannot feel my left hamstring being worked. When I do face-pulls or pulling exercises I have mind muscle memory in the right side of my back but struggle with my left. My right foot faces outwards slightly compared to my left foot which is straight. Any ideas why?
9. Referencing the pics I uploaded - does my posture seem correct? I have a desk job and so I'm very conscious of maintaining good posture. I can't figure out if my neck/back alignment is normal or needs corrective measures?

**Long term goals**

* Be able to do HSPU's.
* Be able to do muscle ups (currently fail in weaker arm for push section of exercise).
* Standing ab wheel rollout
* I am in awe of some BW skills exercises which one day I would like to achieve but in terms of time management I can only focus on a few goals at a time.

It's a lot to unpack into one post but I appreciate any feedback/advice I receive. Thank you all!

TLDR; Working out BW exercises for 3 months (see pics). 5 day training routine is 2x strength, 2x circuits, 3x abs & 1x cardio. See advice needed section for questions on diet/exercise future progression."

"Finally learned to bail from a handstand, what I wish instructors would have taught me",None,603,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8rc8ep/finally_learned_to_bail_from_a_handstand_what_i/,1529079734.0,"I've been trying to get a freestanding handstand on and off for years, and I've taken handstand classes on and off during that time.  I've always been able to kick up onto a wall, but I've never been brave enough to kick up in the center of the room unless I had someone to catch my feet or I was on a gymnastics floor I felt safe to roll out onto if I started falling backwards, and I also couldn't go stomach-to-wall because of the fear of falling backwards.

I really wish one of my several past handstand instructors had addressed my fear with practical solutions and not just ""well, it's better for your alignment to practice stomach-to-wall"".  Like, I get it, but you're asking me to do something I'm terrified of, and who's going to practice something that terrifies them?

So after discovering some folks online like Yuri Marmerstein and Ryan Hurst who stress that you need to learn to cartwheel out safely _before_ practicing off the wall or stomach-to-wall, _and_ who actually gave practical tips on how to do it, I scheduled some consecutive days at a local gym that has a gymnastic floor and got to work focusing entirely on the bail.

I would do some cartwheels, then do some kick ups into a cartwheel to feel out how my weight needed to shift and my hands move to fall back safely, then I would commit to a full freestanding handstand attempt while mentally preparing for a falling-backwards cartwheel bail.. and basically I eased myself into being able to bail confidently.  And I just kept doing it to file it away in muscle memory so that when I tried it without a cushy floor I would feel confident enough that I would do the right thing automatically if I started to fall backwards.

And it went way faster and was far easier than I thought it would be.  Yesterday I finally tried a stomach-to-wall handstand (mentally way scarier than kicking up in the center of the room), and it was AHMAZING.  I understand now why it's so important to do stomach-to-wall practice.  It was great for alignment, but more than that I could maintain that alignment while balancing off the wall for longer, while feeling my weight shift across my hands as I made small corrections for balance.  Brilliant!

I just wish someone had validated my fear and given me actual usable pointers for learning to fall years ago."
Here are a bunch of quick tips to mitigate wrist aches and pains caused by bodyweight exercises.,Antranik,603,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4xjd5o/here_are_a_bunch_of_quick_tips_to_mitigate_wrist/,1471099900.0,"**When doing planks, downward dogs, handstands, etc** 

* **[Slight Turn Out:](http://i.imgur.com/OIXgJqh.png)** Spread the fingers wide apart and set the hand down in such a way that the index finger is facing forward. That will make sure you're turning your hands out slightly, just enough to reduce some potential impingement. (When going more extreme, like in the case of planche's, some people turn them out even more.)

* [**Press down the knuckle of the index finger:**](http://i.imgur.com/EKrcH6z.jpg) Avoid putting all your weight in the heel of your hand by making sure you're pressing the knuckle of the index finger firmly down into the ground! This helps to distribute the pressure better.

* **[Yoga mat mod:](http://i.imgur.com/hoTGvJF.jpg)** Another modification that works to distribute the pressure better, is to roll up the end of a yoga mat so that the wrist bones are elevated and the fingers can slope downwards off the end of them.

**If push ups hurt your wrists, here are some modifications:** 

 * **Do them on fists,** placing most of your weight on the knuckles of the index and middle fingers.
 * **Use push up bars,** parallettes or the iron-gym pull up bar or dumbbells on the floor and use their handles.
  * I made a video showing these tips [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua7B2q21UHg) if you wanna see visually.

**Don't rush through the wrist mobility stuff!**

* I recently had a friend who said they were starting to have wrist pains despite going through **[the wrist mobility exercises](https://youtu.be/8lDC4Ri9zAQ?t=7m20s)** of our [**recommended routine'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) I asked them if they were rushing through them or doing them slowly. He admitted he was performing them all at quite a fast speed because he had memorized them and wanted to speed through them.

* **I've found it best to purposely slow everything down and not rush through the dynamic wrist stretching and strengthening exercises.** Do them purposely in a slower manner, much slower than you're used to and that should help quite a bit.  Rushing through the exercises is almost the same as not doing a wrist warm-up at all sometimes.  Exhibit mindfulness and control and respect for the ritual you're embarking on that involves warming up your body and mind. The warm-up becomes more and more important the more advanced you become so it's good to respect it.

Hope that helps! Also, if you have serious wrist issues that are not healing, seek out a sports oriented physical therapist and take care of your body. Nothing is more important than your health! If you got a tip to share, absolutely leave a comment!"

Should this forum create a ‘Recommended Warmup’ routine?,AlfredTheNoob,604,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/11bfnux/should_this_forum_create_a_recommended_warmup/,1677312336.0,"Sparked from the recent debate re: RR and BWSF and from my own beginner experience - I wondered if there would be a place for a ‘Recommended Warmup’ routine?

Being proud of myself for working out and also trying to do more pull-ups and get some abs.,Subanun,602,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lqvqq3/being_proud_of_myself_for_working_out_and_also/,1614121370.0,"Hey first post ever (on reddit!),

So I recently started working out seriously for the first time in my life. It's still the early stages since I've only been sticking at it for about 2 months now but it's the most I've ever done (without being in a paid program or like a sports club in highschool, just my own dedication for home workout) and I'm feeling pretty proud of myself for that.

The thing is that I'm not seeing much results and it's a bit depressing. I realize that 2 months might not be enough time (especially since I started really light to ease myself into it), but I don't really notice visible changes in my shape, especially my abs (which I've been kind of targeting. ), or in performance (I should say that I'm not fat, 176cm 71 kg, but I might have too much fat percentage for abs...):

For example, an important exercise for me is pull-ups - when I started working out my max was 5 (with kipping) and I could do one more set of 3 max after it, but that's it. Now I can do 7 on the first set (which is awesome!) but STILL only 3 on the second one! Like my arms are done after 1 set and I don't know how to make them last longer. I feel like it's also affecting how fast I can progress, since the volume is very low. Any suggestions about that?

For abs I've been doing reverse crunches and hanging knee raises, but I feel like my lower back is working harder on the latter (maybe improper form?) and that the former might be too easy (I can do 20 with relatively low effort). How can I do better for my ab workouts?

tl;dr week arms can't do many pull-up reps/sets, want sexy stomach like chessboard"

It was a HUGE game-changer for me. I got my exercise in, I was able to get off my chair for a bit, and I felt refreshed! And then I get to reward myself with a meal!

I've tried working out through different times of the day, but morning is too early and evening messes with my sleep. Pre-dinner afternoon isn't an option for me anymore.

"Question for people who have maintained general fitness for quite a long time, what is the secret?",MasterpieceNo198,604,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/xbi45n/question_for_people_who_have_maintained_general/,1662901651.0,"Modern city life can be detrimental to one's health. People who have grown up in cities don't always exercise due to a lack of open spaces. There are exceptions of course.

But people who have spent the first part of their life in the countryside are in comparison more physically active. They walk long distances, play in the open, etc.

**Focus of the Post:**

For the people of the second kind (not necessarily from the countryside, but of similar habits), what has been your experience regarding building muscle, getting strong and being fit into old age? How do you work out? Or maybe worked out? Is it 3 times per week like this sub suggests or is it daily? At what intensity? What kind of routine will give me dividends for a long time. I frankly don't believe that I have to surprise my muscles by doing different movements every now and then. I have heard that calisthenics practitioners can lift moderately heavy weights if asked even though they have never lifted before. Also core develops even if you don't target it separately.

I am asking these questions, because when I see a sturdy old man and ask them about their secret, they never admit to formally working out using a cut out routine or so. They always say, they worked out in the field and did daily chores and walked a lot.

I really want to know what is the necessary bare minimum and what else is just garnishing over that.

Edit 1: Okay, I drew a comparison between city and country life just to demonstrate the differences between the type of lifestyles. I know walking is good for health. But I want the discussion to focus more on 3rd paragraph onwards. Like the different types of workout routines that have proven to be effective to you by making and keeping you strong and healthy for a long long time.

Edit 2: So it seems the situation is reverse in the USA. I come from India where village people are more fit than city people in general."
M 5'11'' movement transformation from 165 lbs to 183 lbs,Eerowest,602,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4lgg7o/m_511_movement_transformation_from_165_lbs_to_183/,1464452794.0,"Hello everyone, I've been sharing some of my movement clips here (monkey movement, lizard movement etc.) and would like to share a bit more this time.

Here is my transformation from 165 lbs to 183 lbs (2013-2015). Before this I did capoeira, dance and I was in shape but not truly fit by any standards.

I'm 180 cm (5’11’’) and 83 kg (183 lbs) and I'm from Finland.

I call this ""movement transformation"" because I didn't just do it with weights or one specific method, but with numerous of different ways of mixing up kettlebells, weights, calisthenics, martial arts and tried pretty much everything imaginable.

I also upload daily pics/videos to my Instagram @eerowest

[-- My actual transformation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hBkzrBwQ2k) which also has tons of training footage to illustrate how I've actually trained.

**Training program:** Mixing up weight lifting (squats, deadlifts), calisthenics (pull up, muscle ups, dips) and martial arts (capoeira, muay thai, mma) to get my results. I often workout daily but take plenty of rest when needed. Heavy focus on mobility work because it allows me to push to my full potential.

**Diet:** Instinctual diet which is about listening to my body and focusing on a healthy lifestyle. Not counting calories or following any structure. I eat salads with any kind of meat, tons of nuts, berries and died fruits. For carbs I also like to eat sweet potatoes.

--
**Beginning**

I did Taekwondo in my teens for 4 years and really liked it, but I lost my interest and quit because of lots of school work. After this I did calisthenics with my friend for a few years.

After my 1-year military service, in my early 20s, I started my college studies and around that time I did capoeira for about 2 years. I enjoyed it for the time but eventually got bored and decided to move onto other things.

I did muay thai, breakdance and modern dance for a bit and also started to take proper strength training seriously.

In the beginning, my training was just calisthenics: dips, pull ups, muscle ups and single leg squats. Eventually, I wanted to I try weight training, gymnastics, back squats, deadlifts and everything I could think of.

**Hitting the wall**

Soon I hit a wall in my training, I wanted to train but couldn’t do it to my full potential. I had some serious problems in my lower back and groin for a long time. Severe discomfort in my shoulder as well.

I visited a couple of physiotherapists but couldn’t get anything that would have actually cured my problems.

It was a long process but eventually it started to yield results and I became an expert in fixing myself and acquired tons of self-knowledge this way.

I realized that most of our problems in training are a result of muscular imbalances that lead to poor mobility, faulty execution and pain. The truth is that almost everything is fixable - if you just find the way.

My versatile training methods has allowed me to take my training to the next level and nowadays I can do feats that I never thought were possible for me.

**Now and future**

Now after doing personal training and YouTube for a long time, I realize all of my hardships were there to help other people to fix their problems and to assist them to find their own way of training.

This is what actually makes me happy: to show people that it’s possible to be healthy and strong and to train the way you want to train. 

You don’t have to accept pain or other problems in your life because most chronic pains are indeed fixable. There is always a way to get stronger.​

Bodyweight Skill Tree Follow Up/Update,3umel,596,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/awm9my/bodyweight_skill_tree_follow_upupdate/,1551560209.0,"**Hey guys!**

This is supposed to be a small follow up post to the one I made a couple of days ago. Since then I have made numerous changes to the original version *(detailed patch notes provided at the bottom)*. Most of the changes come from the input I have received, so I tried to incorporate as much as possible.

I will first provide you guys with the download links:

[Official .xls Version 1.6.1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UAP1N00hsjxCQPggkBHAf_vNbMikPsNg?usp=sharing)

[Official GoogleSheets Beta 1.5.6](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yt_rlb_lgVD3Tt3a0-9W9fl_7M3hrH-EWl7xiD0Yi_E/edit?usp=sharing)

*(There are still some bugs in the GS version such as the loss of some of the hyperlinks; therefore, it is in beta right now :P)*

&#x200B;

To summarize the changes, I've made:

Every Skill/Strength Element is now also a link, that when clicked guides the user to a new spreadsheet where they then have the option to choose from one of the following three video types: Form videos (what it should look like), Tutorials (how to achieve it), and Alternative Tutorials (another way to unlock it).

In addition, the user is also provided with a Variation/Progression link that diverts them into a third and final spreadsheet that contains lists and video links to progressions and variations for most skills.

There might be some misplaced links, but for the most part everything should work. The only exceptions that I know of right now are many of the skill tree links in the google sheet and some of David Packer's tutorials, as they are unavailable right now. I don't know if he is aware of this sub, but if you are reading this: ""Please re-upload your videos bro :D!"". There is of course also the chance that this glitch is specific to me and not actually a problem with his video, so let me know whether you guys are experiencing the same problem. I will try to address the GoogleSheets link issue in due time, but for now, at least the .xls Version should work.

Another point worth mentioning is the common use of two of David Packer's videos, especially for the advanced ring skills. This is because learning these skills is more about understanding a certain type of training which I believe to be the best approach for people who aren't professional gymnasts with access to coaches and spotters.

This about sums up what I wanted to say, so I hope you guys will enjoy the new changes and I will wait for your feedback.

Have fun

People who are intimidated by the RR what is your routine?,None,598,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ku9jmw/people_who_are_intimidated_by_the_rr_what_is_your/,1610261597.0,"The RR is the recommended routine by this sub. And there are well-tested reasons for that. 

But, all humans are not created equal. There are many people in this sub who have asked before several questions regarding routines that can replace RR for their purpose. Many people find it too long, some find it too challenging for a beginner that they give up after a couple or more sessions. And they are genuine reasons because we can't judge others' lives. 

I am sure there are many people in this sub who started out with well-balanced routines other than the RR (even as a beginner) rectifying whatever was bothering them about the RR. Some may have created shorter routines, some split, some daily, and whatnot. 

Can you wonderful people share your such custom routines and what problems you had with the RR that made you start with a different routine? What was your status when you started (beginner/intermediate/advanced/...)? And maybe your age. More like mini progress posts kind of thing. And obviously what tangible results you got out by following the not-RR routine?

I hope this thread turns out to be relieving for beginners who back off after someone suggests the RR on Day 1."

~2.5 years of mostly calisthenics (upper) bodybuilding.,None,594,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4f6ac6/25_years_of_mostly_calisthenics_upper_bodybuilding/,1460893454.0,"[Pictures](http://i.imgur.com/HhqqIBo.jpg). The first one is toward the end of September, 2013, and the second one was April 16th, 2016. I weigh 180 lbs. in both at 6'1.

Disclaimers: I (now, and for most of the 2.5 year time frame) use mostly weights for legs. 

I use *some* weights for upper body as well. I started doing calisthenics because I lacked equipment (although I ended up enjoying it as well). I have a pretty unpredictable life, and in those 2.5 years equipment availability has come and gone more times than I can count. Unfortunately, for long periods of time I had either no access to gym equipment at all, or just enough that I decided to do legs with weights and calisthenics for my upper body. If I had to guess, I've probably done about 75% calisthenics and 25% weight training... again, for upper body.

Now that that's out of the way... Training:

I started doing strength based calisthenics around the time of the first picture. I had very little money, so I bought a door frame pull up bar for cheap, and used chairs to do dips. This is still most of the equipment I have for my bodyweight routine. I eventually bought a pair of high push up handles to increase my ROM on handstand push ups, but that's it. I think I spent maybe $20 on fitness for the first 2 years.

My first routine was something like the recommended routine here, but a bit split up. I did push ups, dips, L-sits and handstand practice on one day, pistol squats, pull ups, bodyweight rows and eventually front lever training the next. I just alternated days and did this about 6 months.

After 6 months I started having on again-off again gym access. Since exact exercises varied so much based on what equipment I had, I have to be general here. I changed my ""split"" up from what I had been doing to PPL, and did this for about 6 months.

One day it dawned on me that I could do push and pull on the same day. Since there is little carryover between many push and pull exercises, I tried supersetting them. I made a PPL - upper/lower hybrid with the volume of PPL and the frequency of a full body split, and have been doing that ever since.

On an upper body day where I only use bodyweight, I will typically do these movements:

Planche training

FL training

Push up progression

Pull up progression

Handstand push up progression

Bodyweight row progression

Dip progression.

On days where I have access/decide to use weights, my routine will look something like:

DL

Bench

OHP

Pull ups

Dips

Bodyweight rows

Incline bench

Rows on incline

miscellaneous isolation for arms and shoulders.

Regardless of whether or not I use weights, work outs are usually between 20-25 sets for each group (20-25 each of push and pull on upper days, 20-25 sets of legs on lower day).

Diet: I do cut/bulk cycles. I prefer to eat around 1g/lb of bodyweight of protein, about the same number of calories from fat, and the rest of my calories from carbs, per day. If my weight stalls for more than 2 weeks I adjust my calories (usually carbs) accordingly. I am a fan of relatively steep cutting, and slow bulking.

Between the pictures: After the first pic, I cut, because I did not want to get fat. I got down to almost 160, and had abs, but was just tiny and looked borderline emaciated. But the plan was to bulk up eventually, which I did for about a year and a half, going from 160-200 lbs. I started cutting again in early February this year, and took the second picture yesterday when I noticed I had reached my original weight again, and wanted to compare.

I injured myself being an idiot while deadlifting in summer of 2014, and it has just gotten better the last few months. This kept me from doing a handful of exercises which aggravated my injury.

The future:

I finally have stable gym access (home gym), and have for a few months. I still do just as much or more calisthenics than weight training for upper body, because I just love it. I plan on cutting down a bit more and then doing another long, slow bulk.

For legs here is my current routine in case any of you are interested:

High bar back squats

Deadlifts

Front squats

Barbell hack squats

Romanian DLs

Straight leg DLs

Floor Glute Ham raises (gotta do a bit of bodyweight, right?)

Calf raises (though these don't count towards the 20-25 sets!)

Today I did my first (actual) overhand grip pull-up!,Lastrevio,599,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qke1dm/today_i_did_my_first_actual_overhand_grip_pullup/,1635773460.0,"After 2 other times I did ""my first pullup"" this time I actually did it. The first two times where I had my first ""pull-up"" I didn't actually do the full range of motion so the first time I thought I did my first pull-up I only did the second half and the second time my arms were still very slightly bent and I skipped the first ~20% of the movement or so. Today is the first time I actually managed to do it with full range of motion, starting from a deadhang and getting my chin above the bar with perfect form (legs straight, no kipping, no momentum, slow and controlled).

I started dieting and working out about 6 months ago. I was at the very limit of being overweight (BMI-wise) and I had no muscle at all. I was 80kg at 179cm height. I didn't get out of the house almost at all for the entire pandemic, so I was very out of shape. Even walking was hard, and walking at a moderate to fast pace for more than 15 minutes was near impossible.  

I started eating in a calorie deficit and in the first month I did random training without any program just to get myself back in shape and somewhat healthy. I used to do pushups and planks and those 4 minute tabatas, mixed with some ""dumbbell workouts"" I found on YouTube with my 4.25kg dumbbells, as well as walking.

In the second month I started lifting weights with two of my friends but I didn't enjoy it that much so after a month I stopped.

From the third month on I started doing calisthenics and I made my own PPL routine (6 days a week) because at the gym we were also doing PPL so I was just used to that. I did pushup variations for my push days (incline and knee at first), on my pull days I only did inverted rows with knees bent since that was the easiest thing I could do with two chairs and a metal bar on them and I couldn't even do one of those with perfect form (bar to chest) at first. On my leg days I experimented with various leg workouts I found on YouTube.

On my fourth month (so for the past 3 months) I started taking it even more seriously and started doing the RR on this subreddit. The only problem was that I didn't have a pull-up bar so I couldn't do the vertical pull progression, therefore the only solution I (thought I) had was doing the horizontal pull progression twice as much. It only hit me recently that I could've done jackknife pull-ups with partial ROM on those two chairs (or L-sit pullups with partial ROM in case I get stronger) but it's too late anyway since I bought a power tower recently and I can actually do proper pullups now. Other than that I think my routine was pretty much the same as the RR, with the exception of the ab exercises of course which aren't as important anyway. 

Today my routine is still mostly similar to the RR but I recently had to split it into push/pull 6 times a week due to schedule reasons. I went from 80kg to 67.5kg today. It took me 6 months to do my first pull-up because of my stupid mistake of only doing horizontal pulling. Now I'm at a point where I can do one pull-up and 21-22 pushups. Either way, it's better late than never.

What's the best method to improve core strength?,bazk88,595,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/wcm34h/whats_the_best_method_to_improve_core_strength/,1659265146.0,"I've found that my limiting factor for nearly all skills seems to be my core. I've virtually never trained my core mostly because I had always done isolation movements where the core component was really for stability in things like squats or deadlift whereas moving to Bodyweight training, you realise it's not just stability, it's a primary mover. It's virtually impossible for me to attempt L sits or handstands with a weak core because you just can't get you body rigid enough. It just flops around.

Now obviously this means more core work, but what's the best way to go about that. Would it be direct core work as part of a workout such as RR, or would it be more frequent direct core work daily or would it just be continue to work on the skills and the core strength will develop as part of the skill progression?

I wondered if direct core exercises such as V ups etc, may fatigue the core too much meaning there isn't enough in the tank to practice skills after that. If so would it be best to stop all skills practising until you get to a base level of core strength first and then start practising skills when the foundation is in place?"

Need help finding a Habitual EVERY DAY routine. Rest days mess me up!,kalebshadeslayer,597,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n3cc69/need_help_finding_a_habitual_every_day_routine/,1619979417.0,"Hi all, I am looking for some advice on building my routine.


 I suffer from depression/anxiety, but I am finally healthy enough to build habits. I am 1 week into a daily routine and my main issue has been with rest days.  I need to create a system where I can get enough exercise EVERY DAY to counteract the depression. Rest days have been hell so far due to the lack of accomplishment/ serotonin release. I know rest is important and I  am willing to change exercises so that worked muscles can rest, but my overall body MUST have a workout every day. I am honestly terrified of falling back into not working out. 


In the past when I have tried to develop a workout skill, rest days were always the days that I would fall off the train. I am unwilling to let that happen anymore. The plan is to get this skill ingrained as a habitual act, so that when I inevitably wake up depressed randomly I won't have to rely on willpower ""which is at that point nonextant"" to exercise, and can instead rely on habit. This process should take about 3 months based on my habit development for meditation.  


My first week of training has been as follows:
4-3 sets x10 BAD FORM 

* Inclined pushups 
* Squats 
* Bench dips 
* 30s no-named plank 
* Rows using rope attached to my wall at belly button height. 


Been doing this 3 days on 1 day off. 


Yesterday I went researching as I kind of like the exercise and I wanted to figure this no rest day thing out. I discovered my terrible form, and have switched over to Antraniks' routine following good form. Talk about a difficulty increase. So I am switching over to 
GOOD FORM 

* full set of planks, 
* 3x8
* incline pushups, 
* rope rows, 
* 1leg L-Sit 30s, 
* Squats.  


He recommends 3 days a week, for this. So what do I do on the rest days? Cardio? a different set of exercises? Sweating seems to be a good indicator that I have exercised enough to help my head. 




I of course want to get stronger/ look better too, but the main goal is to stay out of the rut. 

I am 6'1-2"" 132lb, Been a thin wretch like my dad my whole life, so trying to GAIN not lose as losing would be no bueno. 


/r/EOOD is cool and all, but hasn't been super helpful for me. Seems to be mostly support.  


Thank you in advance for any insight! This sub has already been immeasurably helpful to me.

EDIT: Thank you all for this unexpected and honestly overwhelming response!!!   
Lesson learned: ACTIVE RECOVERY not rest day.  
Light exercise is fine and helpful like walking, Yoga, general stretching, Skill work or some light riding/running.  Splitting exercise up into push/pull/squat can work, but general fatigue can still sneak up here, so maybe still add stretching or walking in too. 

Reframe rest days in my head or I will burn out."

Maybe this goes in sunday show off or whatever. But I did my first muscle ups last week, and was able to repeat today. And I wanted to thank the sub and the RR.

Most of my training has always been crossfit (4-5 sessions a week for \~6 years on/off), and I had progressed ""enough"" in the usual weightlifting and gymnastic movements over there. But last year with the gym's closures I started looking at alternatives and found this sub.

It motivated me to get a pullup bar and a pair of rings and do the strict movements in the RR. I could do maybe 3x5 pull ups and 3x4 dips already, but went to 3x8, and 3x7 in some weeks... And when I went back to the gym this year, I was lucky enough that a weekly strength/technique session was programmed for muscle ups, so we worked on transitions as well (I couldn't have done that at home because of space/safety).

After maybe \~3 weeks of those sessions, I was able to do 2 last week, and 2 more this week, singles each time, but I'm super happy about it . Now I just want to hang from rings at all times XD. As said, I just wanted to thank the community and all of the people that post regularly including the video creators.

By the way, I also got pistols last year, by doing split squats and progressing from there. This sub really rocks.

Has anyone else been in my position?

I had some background in the gym in high school before 2011. Just the average “wanted to pack on some muscle so I did bench press and biceps curls 2 times a week”.

I could also do handstand walks and wall assisted handstand from playing around on my trampoline and back yard. Other than this I did football (soccer) for a long time, but skateboarding was my main thing from middle school through high school. 

I am 179cm tall and in 2011 I weighed in at about 71kg. I am now 82kg. Body fat % never measured, never cared.

Here are the yearly milestones achieved from when starting Calisthenics in 2011:

Starting stats:
3 pull-ups, about 40 push-ups and dips (don’t remember the number)

2011:
Somewhere between 5 and 10 pull-ups (remember I didn’t achieve 10), 1st wall assisted handstand push-up, one arm push-up.

2012:
First free standing handstand, 10+ pull-ups, tuck planche, dragon flag and 10 leg raises.

2013:
1st freestanding HSPU, improved handstand (maybe around 30 sec hold and started working in form), back lever, human flag and 1st muscle up.

2014: 
1st 90 degree push-up, improved handstands, hollow back handstand, 1st shitty straddle planche hold.

2015:
Improvements everywhere, first one arm pull-up (barely and lost it later due to injury), started training for one arm handstand.

2016:
More focus on mobility, improved strength and rep numbers for HSPU, 90 deg, MU, etc. And started working more on explosive HSPU work and creative strength sequences.

2017: 
1st one arm handstand holds (10s best, but inconsistent), 1st straddle Planche press,

2018:
Focused a lot on street workout for my last year of competing, started training different OAHS shapes (flags, tuck, full etc.)

2019:
1st inverted muscle up (bar), 1st OAHS to croc, 10 reps of 90 degree push-up, started training for the one arm handstand push-up (due to an injury preventing me from training the 90 degree range).

2020:
More creative strength work and improvement in most strength exercises. One arm handstand improved a lot (very consistent holds and shapes).

2021: 
1st full planche, 1st full front lever, 1st time 2 reps of one arm chins. Improvement in everything else too. Big improvements in one arm handstand push-up training. 

It may also be of interest to you guys to know about the injuries I have sustained through the years😅

Tennis elbow (maybe 4 rounds on each side), golfers elbow (2 rounds left arm), tendinitis of long biceps head, partial separation of AC joint (what had me start my OA-HSPU training), labrum tear of left shoulder, 2 MC joint sprains (had to do my HSPU training in knuckles for a few months), wrist sprain from twisting my hand, forearms splints (on and off for 2 years in the beginning of my journey), the occasion pulled muscle (mostly chest and lats).

As my training has grown smarter and I have focused more on preventative work and mobility, injuries are less frequent the past few years😊 

Hope this can of help for some of you and happy New Years🎉

*EDIT 1: regarding questions if I use weights in my training 

No, I don’t and I haven’t since I started Calisthenics. This is not because I think using weights is inferior, but because it is not in line with my goals. Specificity is key and it has been the most efficient way of reaching my goals. Yes, you can get a stronger HSPU by doing strict press, but you get an even stronger HSPU by training your HSPU (or it’s regressions). In the same manner, you get a stronger strict press by training HSPU, but an even stronger strict press by training strict press. 
Using weights is however easier, especially regarding programming and forcing progression. There is however many ways of creative programming that works well with Calisthenics too and I have found this challenge to be very interesting and fun 😊

*EDIT 2: regarding questions in my diet

I have tried most diets and with the realisation that there is no such thing as a best diet, or a magical diet, I have ended up with what you can call conscious eating. 

I don’t count macros (but I have at some point which I think can be a good idea for a limited time to get better knowledge about what different food contains), I don’t eliminate any kind of macro, and I eat wholesome, healthy food. Based on experience and knowledge, I obviously make sure I eat enough protein, I stay away from refined sugars and also make sure my diet is rich in micro nutrients by including plenty of greens and nuts. 

I also eat a lot of fats from a variety of sources. Animal fat, omega 3 from fish (If I don’t eat fish I supplement with fish oil), and fat from nuts. 

Regarding carbs, I generally consume mostly slow carbs (but not exclusively) and make sure my meals are low GI to stay satisfied for longer and prevent blood sugar dips throughout the day. 

If I find I am gaining weight, I cut down a bit to see the weight normalising within a couple of months. 
I eat about 4 meals a day because that’s what I feel most comfortable with.

I am not at all saying that this is the best diet, but for me it’s a way of eating that makes me feel good and that I can stick to and fell good about 😊 

That being said, I also think that waaay too many people over complicates their diet and end up spending more time and energy on their diets than on their training. I think that old saying that fitness is 80% diet is BS, especially if training is skill and strength based. Training hard and consistent is your best bet. Diet can optimise your training for sure, but if you eat generally healthy and get your macros, there is not much magic to be gained by following super strict and specific dieting. Everyone is also different and react differently to different diets, so spending time (and will take a long time) finding the diet that works best for YOU is probably the best 😊 If main goal is body building, things may be a bit different, but I don’t have enough experience with this to make an educated comment."
Train lightly nearly every day vs. training harder but less frequently,babyAlpaca_,589,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/x1y0l8/train_lightly_nearly_every_day_vs_training_harder/,1661902341.0,"Hey guys,

I wanna know your opinion about something I found to work well for me.

In the past, when I started with body weight training (roughly 4 years now)  I trained 3 times a week and did around 6 exercises for 3 sets close to failure. I also focused on learning some skills besides. The training became kinda unpleasent for me, as I was sore pretty often.

&#x200B;

Now I switched up my routine. I do 3 basic exercises every day. Mainly Push-up, Pull-up and squats and some variations. Roughly a 30 min workout. This helped me gain some muscle after I had hit a plateau with the method described before. I was also able to reduce body fat and I am not sore much at all.

&#x200B;

I feel that this goes against anything ever recommended. Thats why I wonder what are your experiences with working out more frequently and focusing on the basics.

Edit: it’s great to see so many people share their experiences and delivering YouTube channels and papers on the issue. Thank you guys. This community is so valuable!"

Sprinting instead of 'leg day'?,None,592,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/blmeoi/sprinting_instead_of_leg_day/,1557203821.0,"Does anyone here include sprints in their workouts? Do you do it before/after a bodyweight workout or on a separate day?

I’ve been training calisthenics for about 6 months but mainly do upper body. I practice Kung Fu a couple of times a week which is pretty leg intensive with a lot of isometric holds (horse stance etc) and linking various stances together in our forms (taolu).

However, I was wanting additional leg exercise(s) to do on the days that I workout as I usually only ever do upper body (gymnastic rings).

As far as exercise goes – I'm all about 'getting the most bang for your buck'.

My research lead me to sprinting. I feel like I haven’t seen sprinting discussed much within the bodyweight community?

It is an amazing exercise that works a whole range of muscles (including a great core workout). With the added benefit of burning fat and increasing Human Growth Hormone production to boost muscle growth.

I tried one of the recommended sprint routines post-workout recently from this article (6x100m sprints with 30sec rest). I could only manage 4x100m sprints.

[https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/combine-sprints-and-weight-training-for-accelerated-gains](https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/combine-sprints-and-weight-training-for-accelerated-gains)

It worked my legs and core really well, I had some serious DOMS for a couple of days – and I would consider my legs to be relatively conditioned from training Kung Fu for a year a half."

Why do pullups on my gym's power cage feel better/stronger than pullups with my door frame bar?,None,589,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mt58u2/why_do_pullups_on_my_gyms_power_cage_feel/,1618716539.0,"Hi all,

Been bodyweight training on/off the last couple years and have been consistent the past 8 weeks. My first time back in the gym in a long time (several years) was today and for some reason, it felt like my pullups on the power cage were effortless. The only real differences between the two experiences are: 
1) At home I have to account for/think about my legs because otherwise my legs would hit the ground before completing each rep (whereas at the gym I had to hop up to the bar and my legs just dangled the whole time). 
2) At home, my bar is probably a little thinner in diameter, maybe by 2-3mm. 

My reps were higher per set and my form felt better at the gym. Is this in my head?

edit: I don’t do kip pull-ups, just hollow body, tucked knee, or attempt L-sit pulls. I do experience some flexing in my bar at home as well. I think I’m experiencing a combo of all of the commented issues, haha."
"Nordic hamstring curls are the ultimate bodyweight hamstring exercise, here is a simple setup that can be used at home. Also progression tips in the post.",RockRaiders,587,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7f1u6e/nordic_hamstring_curls_are_the_ultimate/,1511464514.0,"**Update: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/88cvqe/the_nordic_curl_the_ultimate_hamstring_bodyweight/) is an improved tutorial for setups and progressions, making the information below obsolete.**

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91UPKI01cs) is the video demonstration.

**EDIT:** Thanks to /u/Fittritious I remembered that the simplest setup is [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNFN5_mvsZk/hqdefault.jpg), just a sturdy board, some padding like a towel, and a belt. I think I'll do a better post about home hamstring training in the future.

A great exercise for powerful hamstrings. Also known as Russian curls, natural hamstring curls, harop curls or glute-ham raises. Will carry over to your sprinting speed, reduces hamstring strain risk and balances the strength of your quads.

**Before trying it, make sure the setup you use is stable and robust**, I warned you. A safe setup will reward you with awesome hamstring gains.

**Some clarifications:** this exercise mostly uses hamstrings, the glutes only play a small isometric role. That is why I would also recommend you having a glute dominant exercise like deadlifts or hip thrusts in your routine to stay balanced. Also some have mentioned that if you anchor yourself at the balls of your feet you can get calf cramps, so be careful. And finally, be aware that if you are a beginner when descending you can suddenly lose control because of the difficulty, so if you are not using a counterweight or bands, spot yourself with your hands or build up your hamstrings with other tools before attempting this.

**POSSIBLE SETUPS**: 

If you are strong enough to go back up, you will need plenty of counterweight, around your bodyweight. A good test is starting from the bottom and seeing if the anchor point does not move when you try ascending.

It is possible that you already have sturdy furniture where you can anchor your feet, or you can use a partner, stall bars or even the underside of a car if you take some pillows or something soft to put under your knees, you will need it to relieve the pressure. If you are at the gym, you can use the [lat pulldown machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9okm0qEywAI) to do Nordic curls with very scalable assistance.

The video shows an alternative setup that requires little material. You will need a sturdy board, narrow and sufficiently long, a loop or belt or something similar to anchor your feet, pillows or a soft surface for your knees, and some weight to keep the board on the floor. If you don't have dumbbells like me, be creative and use furniture, books, water bottles, sandbags or rocks etc.

**PROGRESSIONS:**

This exercise requires at least intermediate strength, around level 5-6 on the [Overcoming Gravity charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit#gid=2032740838). 

The straighter the line from your knees to your head, the harder this exercise is. If you hinge at the hips you make it easier, you can see it a bit in my video.
Arms back reduce the lever arm and difficulty, while arms forward are the hardest version, but if you are still a beginner keep your arms in front of you in case you lose control, I don't think you want to risk slamming your chest or nose against the floor.

I think the simplest progression is through a counterweight like the lat pulldown machine or a pulley system. The second best option is a resistance band, it will assist you mostly at the bottom, the hardest part where you need it the most.

If you don't have those things, you can use a swiss ball or your arms, as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHaHI48D8lw), to assist yourself until you can go up by yourself. If you have a scale, hand assistance can be measured precisely, the highest value shown during the movement is what you want to reduce with time.

Also you can approach this exercise by keeping your thighs vertical and only bending at the waist, and gradually making the angle of your thighs more horizontal.

Another good supplementary exercise/alternative/progression are floor sliding hamstring curls. You need a smooth surface, for example socks on wood.

A [single leg sliding curl](https://youtu.be/L5ljNgP5KQY?t=30s) can require similar strength to a Nordic curl concentric, depending on floor surface. This was true in my case and they served me well.

If you are strong and already find Nordic concentrics easy, make sure your hips are fully extended, and you can extend your arms forward or keep a small weight on your chest for harder leverage.

I'm Screwed: How can I win a 20 push-up contest against an adult in 4 days? I'm a teenager who can barely do 15.,ButterFront,588,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/19aatfh/im_screwed_how_can_i_win_a_20_pushup_contest/,1705639492.0,"My class, unfortunately filled with many friends, voted me to do a push-up contest with my teacher whom enthusiastically accepted. In reference, I can do 15 pushups after a minibreak after the 10th one. So in 4 days of prep time, how am I supposed to do 20 pushups in a row, fast, and not lose face in front of my entire class? Also there are girls in the class so losing isn't an option.

For reference, if you're still reading, I'm 17 and am borderline underweight. No muscle and although I could do 25 pushups half a year ago, after the sports season is over I could barely do 10 without panting.

Thanks for reading. My current plan is to do 100 pushups everyday, broken up til failure, and drinking lots of milk.

Edit: It's not a shitpost"
Pulling strength on a featureless plane with zero equipment: the reverse planche family (and a few other exercises).,RockRaiders,589,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7spycu/pulling_strength_on_a_featureless_plane_with_zero/,1516824571.0,"**Note from the future:** before giving up on rows make sure you have read [this more recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/857cqj/no_idea_where_to_do_pullups_and_rows_here_are/), it's very likely you'll find a way to do them.

Are you stuck on an infinite plane with no bars or tables or overhangs or doors where you can stick a bed sheet? Well, too bad, since rows are a really useful exercise and even the humble inverted row can be progressed to the challenging straight body one arm version.

But if you are too lazy to find a setup for rows or you ended up in a bare prison cell, you can still train your back muscles, potentially to very high levels, but it will be less efficient without a bar or rings or weights.

So what are your options? All these variations have you supine on the ground, with a focus on **shoulder hyperextension** (your arm goes behind your body line, mostly thanks to the rear deltoids), **scapular retraction** (mid and lower traps, rhomboids) and **depression** (lats), **posterior pelvic tilt** (abs and glutes) and in the later variations **elbow extension** (triceps).

First exercise variation: the **[reverse pushup](https://youtu.be/cszJcRz5UB0?t=2m17s)**. As Jeff demonstrates, for good range of motion you need the luxury of something like two chairs, but you can also do it on the floor with two stacks or books (or [some carpets](https://youtu.be/cszJcRz5UB0?t=4m6s)) or even nothing, just pressing your elbows down (range of motion will be limited). To scale the difficulty, the absolutely easiest version has your butt on the ground, then there is the version with bent legs, where you are straight from the knees to the head like in a tabletop bridge, and the straight body version which is the hardest.

The advantage of this variation is that you get some range of motion, while most of the following exercises will be isometrics, where strength carries over to around 30° around the joint angle and you get less stimulation for muscle growth.

Next variation: the **reverse planche lean** from a tabletop bridge position. As explained [here](https://youtu.be/7hdh5BjsRuQ?t=10s), do not contract the calves and hamstrings to reduce the load, rely only on the rear deltoids. If this gets easy, do the lean with straight legs.

After this, we have the dragon press and forearm manna/reverse planche/Victorian variations, where your lower body is not in contact with the ground, so depending on how extended your legs are, you have the usual **leverage progressions**: tucked body, l-shaped/piked, advanced tuck, one leg out or half straddle, straddle, half lay, full lay.

**Dragon press**: this is sort of a harder dragon flag variation, with the advantage of working your shoulder extension through some range of motion if you do it dynamically instead of only holding the bottom position. A [full lay dragon press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRmtTxwBlsY) is around front lever level of difficulty, and it can even be done with [one arm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6009QVxS4Us) to really load one side's rear deltoid and tricep. The [wide dragon press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzZvQXvnXeo) is also hard because shoulder transverse extension is another way of isolating the rear deltoids.

**Forearm Victorian (or manna/reverse planche)**: this is an isometric hold, where only the forearms and hands touch the floor and your body is horizontal. Even the tucked version is difficult, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrNTTN77648) is a tutorial to get started. On parallel bars or two objects it is easier because your body can sink down lower. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgGbFp4EMbc)'s a full lay example on chairs. On [parallettes](https://youtu.be/O4btB6ChdCU?t=1m1s) or any support where only part of the forearms is in contact it's harder, and the [floor full lay](https://youtu.be/t6y8aULZpvA?t=3m43s) is insanely hard, even harder than a one arm dragon press and around the level of an actual [ring Victorian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdKkH5ZAE-A).

**Reverse planche**: the second hardest skill, I have written about it in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7eehfv/the_victorian_cross_and_reverse_planche_are/). Harder than the dragon press and similar to the forearm floor version, the least impossible variation is [on parallel bars or parallettes](https://youtu.be/t6y8aULZpvA?t=34s), while the [floor version](https://youtu.be/t6y8aULZpvA?t=1m31s) is at the limit of human performance. Now imagine how hard it would be on rings.

**Floor Victorian**: nobody has managed to float above the floor while only supported by the hands for more than an instant. The closest thing, and arguably the hardest street workout element that's been achieved, is the [hold with one forearm's support](https://youtu.be/2--aR6RAAv0?t=7m12s).

So these were the hardest pulling elements requiring only the floor or a few stacked objects like books. If you trained only these your progress would probably be much slower than if you had access to bars and rings, but it's interesting to see that these options exist.

**Bonus**: for vertical pulling, you can do **[floor sliding pullups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWzI5yWLAZI)**, and to make them harder use one arm or increase friction. Similar to an ab wheel rollout, there is the **[floor pullover](https://youtu.be/DyoUqDzpVko?t=1m37s)**, which can be done on knees or feet. For the **side deltoids**, there is [this dynamic exercise](https://youtu.be/ZzjSbsPm85k?t=3m31s) and [this isometric exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfNrWMWmBTI).

**Edit:** worth mentioning that [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7sde7m/piss_off_rbodyweightfitness_with_one_sentence/dt3x8he/) inspired the title, so it was helpful for the creative process."
Bwf skill tree (like in an RPG),neerg,588,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5btde0/bwf_skill_tree_like_in_an_rpg/,1478614052.0,"Does anyone know of a resource that documents all (or most) of the different bwf skills in a tree form, such that basic moves are at the top, and as you move down the tree, you get to advanced moves. Connected nodes would represent prerequisites. I'm imagining like in an RPG where you have multiple skill paths, this tree would have a path for pull-ups, dips, push-ups, etc. Eventually there would be a merging of pullup/dip for the muscle up, but each path would still continue independently too (eg one arm chinup).

This has probably been asked before but I couldn't find it via search. I think it'd be fun to track accomplishments this way, a gamification of sorts.

* Age: 30
* Height: 188 cm
* Calisthenics: 3-4/week
* Cardio: 1-2/week

Why I did it? Increase relative strength for calisthenics and to look better.

Some notes/tips:

* I use 7-day average kcal data to get way more flexible in what/when I eat. Master those compensation tactics! So you can eat shit food and drink alcohol whenever the occasion presents itself.
* I created a custom kcal sheet because I think it's more accurate than diet apps and and takes me less time to use (formatted for easy mobile use). The columns can collapse so I can see detailed daily kcal and macros if I want to.
* Besides skipping breakfast for coffee I did not do any fancy diet - I just ate what I like and made sure it was satiating and full of protein.
* I got in 3 weeks of below 2000 kcal a day (750-950 kcal deficit), those were tough but felt rewarding!

Calisthenics level:

* Cleaning up my muscle ups
* Progressing from bent arm stands to handstand push ups
* Holding 45 degree human flags

Strength progress was slow during weight loss so I can't wait to eat on/above maintenance again in the coming months and unlock those super strict muscle ups and handstand push ups!

*EDIT - adding workout routine details:*  


* In these 4 months I mainly went to an outdoor calisthenics park with friends in the evening. That's the best 'routine' I can recommend to anyone: combine working out with hanging out.
* I bring resistance bands, a weight belt, kettlebells, rings, and parallettes to the park.
* Warm up: I ALWAYS do the recommended routine warm up of this subreddit.
* Then I decide if I go pull, push, legs, core or a combination of those, depending on what I did earlier that week, the state of my body, time available, what my friends do, etc. I like to be flexible in this.
* I picked exercises I want to progress on on-the-go from this sheet and I keep track of progressions: [https://imgur.com/a/P18GhFZ](https://imgur.com/a/P18GhFZ)
* Muscle ups and handstand push ups were my main skill goals - I always start with training those. Followed by some weighted work using kettlebells, then bodyweight work, then finishing up with human flags and/or basic mobility work.
* For cardio I mainly did running: trying to get faster at 3.3km (1 round of Vondelpark in Amsterdam).
* I pickup up bouldering in september, doing that once every 1-2 weeks now.
* In the coming winter period I go to the gym but I will keep doing calisthenics - currently programming a new routine/exercises for solo morning sessions before work."

I'm extremely broke right now and probably at the lowest point of my life. But, yes, I will buy equipment when I get the money which some may think it'll take a month, but it'll take me way more time than that.

So to cut it short, I'm looking for a routine that takes no equipment. I'm sorry once again because this sounds annoying, but thank you for reading my post. Please reply your suggestions, thank you.

EDIT : Thank you all so so much for the replies. I'm trying my best to thank everyone personally but there's way more replies than I ever imagined. I will take every suggestion into consideration, thank you very much!!!"
So apparently I haven't trained my back at all,KptRex,583,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/sarp70/so_apparently_i_havent_trained_my_back_at_all/,1642937406.0,"I always done pull ups and chin ups without feeling my back, and thought that this is how it has to be, got to around 30 without additional weight and now I'm doing 7-8 with 25kg as the progression, It was similar story dumbbell rows, my arms would just give up first without any feeling coming from my back  


And there is also the thing that for the guy that has fully visible 6 pack and obliques lats are barely visible and anything below them just non existent  


Cable rows seem to be what most people recommend for ""feeling your lats"",  but then I always trained at home so buying gym membership just to train the back seems kinda weird, Got any tips to help me?"
Exercise Library Update: In-depth Form Guides to All The BWF Strength Pairs in The Recommended Routine!,Captain_Nachos,584,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/akrtb6/exercise_library_update_indepth_form_guides_to/,1548708236.0,"Hi guys!

At the beginning of the year some of you might remember I started developing an exercise library, and shared that with you once I had a few entries into it (By then I'd only finished the squat, pushup and pull-up, I believe). Since then, I've still been working on it, and now have completed entries on all the main strength pairs in the RR, apart from the core triplet!

[Click here to check out the exercise library's main BWF page](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/)

&#x200B;

The total collection is now:

**Pair 1:**

* [The Pull-Up](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/the-pull-up/)
* [The Dip](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/dip/)
* [The Pike Push-up](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/pikepu/) (Not in the RR but a good alternative to dips for those that may get sternum pain from dips/want to work on overhead pressing for handstands/have the strength to work on them)

**Pair 2:**

* [The Inverted Row](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/row/)
* [The Push-up](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/pushup/)

**Pair 3:**

* [The Squat](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/squats/)
* [The Hinge](http://www.nick-e.com/exercise-library/calisthenics/bodyweight-hinge/)

Apart from the core triplet, these guides should give you all the basic fundamentals of each movement pattern in the RR. Progressions from these basic patterns in the RR will not tend to deviate much in the main aspects of the form (e.g. a ring dip will have the same fundamental form benchmarks as a PB dip, but there will be other things like ring lockout/turnout to take into account on top of that, or a wall HeSPU has the same fundamental form benchmarks as a pike pushup, but you are fully laid out rather than compressed, etc. etc.)

&#x200B;

I made a full RR tutorial on my site 3 years ago now (which is so stupidly outdated its not even funny lol) yet people still check it quite regularly. I was thinking I could update that to fit the current iteration of the RR, if anyone would be interested? Aware there's been a lot of RR help resources released in the 3 years since I made my first guide so it might not be the most relevant or needed. Comment and let me know if you'd like that and if there's enough desire for it I'll do it.

Hope you enjoy the guides!

Best Ab Movements for Weak Abs and a Bad Back,BigN1374,583,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/uiy7ds/best_ab_movements_for_weak_abs_and_a_bad_back/,1651759506.0,"I used to be really in shape, but after college I let it go a bit. Been wanting to get back into working out and get fit again so I've been doing bodyweight workouts everyday. My problem is my abs have never been the strongest, and when I was lifting in college I hurt my back. So now when I do certain movements like say planks my back starts hurting me (I am clenching my abs and body to the best of my ability) after a very short amount of time (like 20 seconds after I start on the first one, and 15 seconds on 2nd+). And its not exactly light pain either.. So I'm looking for more back friendly ab movements until I can get my abs strong enough to do other movements without pain."
Calisthenics School: Back Lever,workout37,584,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lky33t/calisthenics_school_back_lever/,1613457972.0,"Hi guys! My name is Arthyr Morozov, Im from Chelyabinsk, Russia. Here I'm owning a calisthenics school where I train people (mostly kids and schoolers), and from my several years of experience I have developed some really working programms towards different advanced calisthenics elements like human flag, back and front levers, handstand push-ups and etc. So I decided to share them with you, since they may help you to progress faster. Please leave a feedback comment if this is needed, and I will post more.

**If any exercise will be unfamiliar to you, feel free to write in comments, I will try to find a video/gif/jpeg to illustrate. I'm not pretty good with english exercises names, sorry.**

Today I will share my routine for Back Lever, but first, **Warm up!** ALWAYS warm up thoroughly in order to prepare your body for the load and protect it from injury. A good warm-up option from Maxim Trukhonovets (**@max\_true** on Instagram) can be seen on the link - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYoAnPWZgdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYoAnPWZgdA)

Before starting the program, I want to remind you of a few important points:

&#x200B;

1. Hands should always be straight at the elbows.
2. Exercise no more than once a day.

&#x200B;

**Stage 1 (3 workouts per week, 1-3 weeks to complete)**

At this stage, your main task will be to learn how to properly maintain the position of the body in space, in particular, to learn how to properly work the upper back and core muscles. In parallel, we will strengthen the ligaments and joints, especially the elbow and shoulder, so that you do not injure yourself in the later stages.

&#x200B;

Hanging on the bar with rolled shoulders

2 sets of 30 seconds

&#x200B;

Hanging with rolled shoulders with a round back

3 sets of 30 seconds

&#x200B;

Hanging lifts with rolled shoulders

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Push-ups from the horizontal bar

3 sets of 15 reps

&#x200B;

**Stage 2 (3 workouts per week, 1-3 weeks to complete)**

We continue to master the control of the body in space, adding several new approaching exercises, including such a rather difficult one as closing the shoulder blades in a closed back hang.

&#x200B;

Skin the cat

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Tucked backlever

2 sets of 30 seconds

&#x200B;

Shpulder shrugs in tucked backlever position

3 sets of MAX reps

&#x200B;

**Stage 3 (2 workouts per week, 2-4 weeks to complete)**

A key step in this program that will likely take you longer than you anticipate. Because we are going to study the transition from a closed grouping to a semi-closed grouping, which is the most difficult part in all static horizontal elements. Your task, as in the previous levels, is to learn to understand the work of your body, in particular the rectus abdominis muscle.

&#x200B;

Transitions from tucked backlever to semi-tucked backlever 

2 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Semi-tucked backlever (knees on the other side of the bar)

2 sets of 20 seconds

&#x200B;

Inverted hanging on the Swedish wall

2 sets of 20 seconds

&#x200B;

**Stage 4 (4 workouts per week, 2-4 weeks to complete)**

This stage is a sophisticated version of the previous one.

&#x200B;

Muscle-ups (using momentum)

5 sets of MAX reps

&#x200B;

Slow lowerings from top inverted hang to backlever with bent legs

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Slow opening from tucked backlever to backlever with bent legs

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

**Stage 5 (4 workouts per week, 2-3 weeks to complete)**

Quite a difficult stage, but necessary for the study of the posterior hang. I also added some new exercises to it.

&#x200B;

Slow lowerings to the backlever with straddle legs from top vertical inverted hang

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Slow openings from tucked backlever to backlever with bent legs

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Core Exercise: Superman (belly to the sky)

2 sets of 40 seconds

&#x200B;

Core Exercise: Superman (back to the sky)

2 sets of 40 seconds

&#x200B;

**Stage 6 (5 workouts per week, 2-3 weeks to complete)**

The most difficult stage, on which I would like to dwell in more detail. Here we will also add some new exercises to our workouts.

&#x200B;

Slow lowering into backlever legs together from top inverted vertical hang

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Slow openings from tucked backlever to full backlever legs together

3 sets of 10 reps

&#x200B;

Once again, I would be glad to read your feedback/questions, so feel free to share your thoughts!"

Constantly stretching your traps may make your neck pain worse over time!,m092,581,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8vzfip/constantly_stretching_your_traps_may_make_your/,1530685379.0,"After reading this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8vrvft/quick_reminder_stretch_you_stiff_neck/

I just wanted to share some things I've seen in my clients, and have learnt from clinical practice.

But first, a disclaimer! This is not to be taken as medical advice, the neck is a complex structure that holds many communicating structures, muscles, and connective tissues in it, any of those may be causing you pain. If you're concerned about your pain, particularly if you're getting radiating pain or other symptoms such as tingling or numbness, then seek the advice of a professional!

With that out of the way, I see a lot of neck pain in the people I train, and the people I treat. The vast majority of them are desk-bound workers, and have tried the traditional stretch your pain away approach, and it hasn't had much success for them.

**The situation I'm about to describe is by far the most common neck pain presentation I see.**

Joe has neck pain. It's a generally mild thing, it's annoying, but it's not something so bad that it's his first priority, it's really just a bother. Joe works at a desk, and says he just needs to fix his posture, and it will all be better.

Joe stretches his neck habitually. He doesn't make it a big thing, he just stretches it when he feels tight at work. The stretch feels good, but his pain is nearly always back the next day.

Joe mentions his neck pain in passing to me while we're training. I can see it, his shoulders are dropping, and they often roll forward during training. I give Joe some upper trapezius **strengthening** exercises. **Shrugs with about 30 degrees of abduction with a pause, shoulders back.**

Joe says the exercise feels a bit relieving, but it doesn't change his pain after for long. However, a few weeks down the track, I check in with Joe about his neck, he says he still gets the pain, but it's better and less frequent.

##Is tightness painful, and is tightness even tightness?

Generally, the Joe's of the world can touch their ear to their shoulder, or get pretty close. They can drop their shoulder blades down towards their back pockets without too much issue. Certainly, they're not restricted as if their upper traps are too tight.

When you look at Joe, often his shoulders are down, collarbones slanted towards the ground. His upper traps are **long**. If they were tight, wouldn't they be short?

When Joe stretches his traps, or moves his neck, he doesn't get a grabbing pain, so it doesn't seem that his neck is getting painful due to a short, tight limitation.

When Joe is cued to pull his shoulders up a bit, or he does a shrug to centre his shoulder blades on his ribs, he actually gets a bit of relief. It seems that the tightness is position dependent. Joe's shoulders and neck feel sore and tight when his traps are **lengthened**.

##What does stretching do?

If his motion isn't restricted, what is stretching actually doing?

Passive stretching generally inhibits muscles. It inhibits their contractibility, which is generally why you can drop into a longer stretch after you hold a stretch for a while, because you've fatigued the muscle's ability to contract.

It also inhibits the sensory input from the muscle, which also contributes to your ability to push past an uncomfortable position in a stretch. It also explains why stretching an uncomfortable muscle feels good, it masks the discomfort.

Long-term passive stretching alone may reduce the strength of the muscle, and increase its propensity for being long.

##So why strengthen?

If Joe's shoulders are always dropped, his upper traps are lengthened, and he isn't getting any relief from stretching, I suggest he might have **weak upper traps**.

Strengthening his upper traps will do a few key things:

* Promote a shorter upper trapezius position for his day to day posture.
 *  This should reduce the feeling of tightness
 * Reduce the pulling of his traps on his cervical spine, and associated fascia, which will reduce the incidence of **Cervicogenic headaches** and/or **tension headaches**
* Increase the endurance of his upper trapezius muscles, in order to maintain this new position for longer.
* Have knock-on postural effects. Remember Joe's forwards shoulders? Well, it's actually really hard to get your shoulders back when they're dropped as well. Try dropping your shoulders hard and then retracting them while keeping your shoulders down. Hard isn't it? Lifting your shoulders allows for better forwards/backwards movement of the scaps as well.
* Strong upper trapezius help with your scapulohumeral rhythm. Movement of your arm at about shoulder height requires your shoulder blades to move to best facilitate it. Having your shoulder blades locked down means that overhead movements are going to be limited, possibly caused impingement and pinching in the shoulder, and decrease your overhead strength (goodbye handstand).
* Makes the upper trapezius more resistant to nagging pains. Imagine your upper traps are a rubber band. If you always stretch it, day in and day out, you can see it's going to get pretty worn out and ratty quickly. Muscles aren't too different. However, if you build up the traps, you'll be promoting muscle healing, as well as building up a much thicker, resilient rubber band too.

##The exercise

Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNsF730kUdM

I train my clients against a wall, to cue their shoulders staying against the wall, very slight retraction and no rolling forwards. Arms are about 30 degrees away from your body, as this lines up with the fibres of the upper trapezius, maximising the line of pull. I'll generally use light weight, about 2-5kg but water/milk bottles or no weight at all still works. I also make sure they pause at the top, this is about endurance after all!

I generally program about 3x10-20 reps, and put them in every workout, but this certainly a good every day exercise."

But I wanted to thank this sub for all of the information and knowledge that you all share. It has been such a great experience and I continue to make progress while following the RR.

&#x200B;

 So I wanted to make a post after just finishing up a BodPod assessment and share my experience with my fitness experience in 2021.

Unfortunately I don't have any before pictures since I was too ashamed and embarrassed to even take them. Here is a link to my current physique and a picture of the BodPod numbers (7.1% bodyfat)

[https://imgur.com/a/wSLlPdZ](https://imgur.com/a/wSLlPdZ)

**Background**

Growing up I have always been active. I got into weight training at age 15 and played a lot of basketball throughout high school (never at Varsity level but a lot of pick-up games). Basketball fell off a little after I finished college around age 23 but I kept up with weight lifting. At that point I wanted to get as big and strong as possible and got really into powerlifting. I maxed out at 305 bench, 385 squat, and 465 deadlift at around 180lb, and in 2018 after several injuries (hamstring, pec, shoulder impingement) I had to call it quits and figured it was not worth it to me. I continued to lift functionally but wasn't tracking anything and started playing basketball again just to get some cardio in. I remained at this level of activity and stuck around 170lb and I'm guessing around 15-18% body fat at that point.

**Enter divorce and Covid**

In late 2019 I went through a divorce which was difficult enough for me, then Covid hit and my fitness and overall health went to shit. I didn't do anything active from March 2020 - January 2021 and jumped up to 190lb and gained a whole lot of fat while losing muscle.

January 2021 I decided to turn it around and started following the Bodyweightfitness subreddit since I was too embarrassed to go back into the gym. I pretty much stuck with their recommended routine while throwing in various exercises I found on YouTube (FitnessFAQs mainly), and also picked up basketball again. I tracked my calories almost obsessively and ate around 1,200-1,500 calories a day. I would have my cheat days where I drank a lot of alcohol/beer and ate like crap so I have no idea how much I would take in on those days but I would make sure to get back on track the next day. One thing to note with pick-up basketball is that you never really get a consistent amount of exercise with it. Some days you play 3-5 games and can burn a shit load of calories and other days you may only play one game and it's almost a waste of time.

A couple of months ago I started adding some cardio exercises at the end of the recommended routine from the BWF subreddit, while also doing more cardio at the end of basketball days where I didn't play as much as I would've liked. I also cut out all drinking and didn't really have any cheat days. I would have some cheat meals but tracked it as much as I could and still tried to remain under 2k calories on those days. Throughout this whole process I thought I was maybe undercalculating my calories as I never really felt exhausted or low on energy during my workouts. I felt like if I was at such an extreme caloric deficit I would've felt the impact and be near passing out while exercising, but that never happened.

Going into the BodPod I thought I was at maybe 12% bodyfat at best, but the results say I am at 7.1% which in my eyes which still doesn't feel right. Due to Covid they didn't have the breath tube thing setup for the BodPod so it may be a bit more inaccurate than normal but we can't be sure how much of a discrepancy that would be. It could also be some bad lighting where I'm currently staying but it's crazy how much impact lighting and bloating has to do with how you look. I swear there are some days where my abs aren't even visible and I feel like I could lose more fat in general. I'm sure this has to do with my very low self-esteem.

**Reactions**

Even now knowing my bodyfat % I still have some weird obsession to lose more fat and want to keep up with my low deficit. However, I know this will end up being not healthy if I drop any further really so I intend to increase my calories by around 300 calories/day and see where that gets me in a few months. I don't intend to do another BodPod assessment for a while, but just keep track of my progress in the mirror, which again is difficult to do with some lighting."
a powerlifting-style calisthenics strength cycle from Strongfirst,JBredditaccount,587,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jaf8z9/a_powerliftingstyle_calisthenics_strength_cycle/,1602601560.0,"Hey, peeps. I thought I'd share this link. It's a powerlifting-style strength cycle from Pavel's people at Strongfirst and we all know Pavel from his fighter pull-up program and his Grease The Groove method.

https://www.strongfirst.com/simple-strength-plan-for-difficult-times/

I'm excited to do this workout after my current strength cycle. I recently purchased GMB's integral strength and, while I like a lot of the concepts, I'm not as happy with the exercise selection. This program lets you do whatever exercise you want.

In this program, you pick a squat, a pull and a push that you can do for 8-10 reps (to technical failure, not muscular failure) and hit them in a heavy, light, medium fashion over the course of a week. Over 8 weeks you build up the volume and then test your maxes again.

On the rest days you can do aerobic recovery, corrective work, stretching, etc. I plan on doing aerobics, yoga and Original Strength resets (something I recently started playing with and have been really happy with). I may add light ab and spine work on the rest days.

The guy who wrote this created a follow-up program if you want another 8 week cycle that follows the same principles.

If you guys haven't looked into the Strongfirst calisthenics stuff, you should give it a shot. They also have Karen Smith, whose pistol and pull-up progressions are really fantastic and underrated. I highly recommend her articles and youtube videos.

I'm posting this because I've always wished there was more powerlifting-style programming in the bodyweight training world and I've seen several other people on here express the same sentiment. It's challenging training with percentages in calisthenics because you can't easily adjust the weight you're moving, but by having you select exercises at the desired percentage (your 8-10 rep max) it's a pretty easy and brilliant solution."

#You get a rush from planning just how good you’ll be and how much progress you’ll make

You plan how you’ll start an exercise plan, how you’ll diet on Monday, how you’ll be *so good* when you have a perfect week. This sets off all sorts of lights in your brain that leads to a hormone cascade that feels so *great*. Unfortunately, this is often the rush we get addicted to, rather the rush of actual accomplishment. The rush of your imagined perfect week becomes satisfying enough that the effort of actually following through isn’t even necessary any more. You could become addicted to chasing that planning high and making the most elaborate plan ever, potentially leading you down the path of analysis paralysis.

This leads to a cycle of planning; feeling good; becoming complacent and inadequately following through; feeling disappointed in your effort and disillusioned with the process; convincing yourself that the either the plan wasn’t good enough (leading to more planning wankery) or that you just “need to try harder next time” and never getting anywhere.

**How do you turn this to your advantage?** 

Planning is good, it helps you organise your efforts. But preparing is better. Preparing is planning backed with action. You still get that rush from planning, but you actively engage yourself in the process, meaning you’re more likely to continue to with action. Preparing reduces the friction and inertia in actually starting.

Some key examples are:

* Don’t plan to go to the gym tomorrow. Prepare by laying out your gym clothes ready to go and putting the appointment in your calendar.
* Don’t plan on going to bed earlier to get more restful sleep. Prepare by putting a reminder to start your pre-bed ritual.
* Don’t plan to eat healthier. Print out the recipe and write out your grocery list.

Put these preparations in obvious, in-your-face places. Stick the prepared lists to your fridge, the clothes by your door or on your bedside table. Make sure you can’t trick yourself into missing your earlier efforts.

Obviously this tip doesn’t always work, but it’s a good thing to consider if you can.

#You have an All-or-Nothing approach.

“I’m going to go to the gym every day this week”. Then you miss your session on Thursday, so Friday, Saturday and Sunday are a write off.

Now this approach has some obvious drawbacks, but it’s hard to get out of this subconscious trap. The key advice here is to be more forgiving to yourself and set more flexible and realistic goals. That’s easier said than done.

**How do you turn this to your advantage?**

People who live by this philosophy I’ve found often hate breaking a winning streak, so once they’ve got going with a habit, they’ll find it harder and harder to drop it, which is great when that habit is exercise! 

So how do we get a habit in the first place if it’s so easy to drop it early with one early setback? Set gateway goals. Set goals that are so easy to complete, but you’ll often go ahead and do more anyway:

* Go to the gym for at least 5 minutes
* Put a bottle of water and a glass on your desk at work
* Write one sentence of your essay

These goals are so minuscule you’ll want to just knock them out of the park early, they’re so easy you’ll beat yourself up for breaking your streak by not just going to the gym for 5 minutes, they’re forgiving, because you really can go to the gym for 5 minutes and then leave if you’re not feeling it, and you’ll still have your streak. But the main point is, you’re likely to do most of what you want to accomplish once you’ve started, so make it your goal to just start!

Mark it on a calendar, count the number of days in a row, and don’t cheat!

#You take days off training because factor x means training won’t be **OPTIMAL**

We’re always looking for excuses to avoid hard shit. We’re convinced our time training isn’t worth shit if we aren’t in peak physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual condition. We’d rather take a day off and try to catch up, probably eventually deciding our catch up day wasn’t optimal either and forever fall behind.

**How do you turn this to your advantage?**

Your brain is so good at finding all the reasons something is hard, don’t try to fight it, turn into the wind. Let’s list all the ways something could mess up your training:

* You didn’t get enough sleep
* You slept in and now you’re rushed
* You haven’t had your coffee
* You’ve had too much coffee and you can’t focus
* You’re too hungry
* You ate too recently
* You’re too bloated
* You haven’t had enough carbs
* You haven’t had enough calories
* You haven’t had enough protein
* You’re still sore
* You’re feeling a bit clumsy today
* You’ve an important project
* You have people coming over later
* You haven’t done all your chores
* It’s the anniversary of your dog’s death and you’re too sad
* It’s too hot
* It’s too cold
* You have a blister
* You got sunburnt
* It’s too late to gym now
* It’s the wrong time to gym, it’s too busy
* Your training buddy is busy
* Your favourite training tank is drying
* You can’t find any shorts
* You’re just not feeling it
* You really should be practising flute
* You think your rings might be haunted
* You’re a bit constipated

There really are a lot of reasons your training could be sub-optimal, and I’m willing to bet that every single session you’ve had has been sub-optimal. A lot of them are legitimate too. So what’s the worst that could happen, what are you really worried will happen?

* You might not get all your reps
* You might have slightly sloppy form
* You might not feel great

Fly into the wind with your excuses, but then ask yourself what you’re afraid of. Maybe it’s nothing."
Am I obsessed with fitness to an unhealthy degree?,Grand-Employer912,580,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1648c7v/am_i_obsessed_with_fitness_to_an_unhealthy_degree/,1693283180.0,"So my wife recently has been complaining to me that I’m obsessed with fitness and that it’s affecting our marriage.

I work double shifts three days a week, so I only train 4 days a week. Monday-Thursday I do a full body calisthenics workout that includes a ten minute warm up, about 35 minutes of calisthenics and then 30 minutes of zone 2 cardio. I usually wake up and eat a pre-workout snack, workout, then shower and eat a post workout meal. The whole process takes about two hours total including training, showering, and eating. 

My diet is pretty clean. I eat a Mediterranean style diet and avoid processed foods 90% of the time but do usually eat some junk food as a treat once or twice a week. My wife thinks I’m too strict with my diet but I personally enjoy it and it keeps me feeling good. I don’t feel great when I start eating lots of junk food or take out so I do try to stick to healthy eating. She said my eating interferes with normal life because I don’t eat out at fast food places and like to cook my own food. 

At bed time I usually take 20 minutes to wind down with some breathing exercises and stretches because it really helps me manage stress and l get a good night of sleep. She feels it’s excessive and interferes with us relaxing together and talking before bed. 

The truth is I’m very passionate about living a healthy lifestyle and doing so has really made me feel great and has improved my quality of life in so many ways. But I’m feeling a bit confused because from my standpoint I feel that I have a pretty reasonable lifestyle and I don’t think working out for 1 hour or so 4 days per week is obsessive and I also feel that eating clean is something that can be challenging sometimes but is a worthwhile goal. 

Not really sure how to handle this as I can’t see myself ever giving up my fitness habit but I also don’t want to hurt my marriage. She tells me that all I think about is fitness and my health and that I have no other interests in life. I definitely am very passionate about it but it just seems a bit overboard to say I’m obsessed."
The most comprehensive front lever tutorial,Yaad_Mohammad,577,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10dk3ic/the_most_comprehensive_front_lever_tutorial/,1673888738.0,"The most comprehensive front lever tutorial. I remember my first post ever on this subreddit actually being a front lever tutorial that I made 9 years ago. After 9 years I've decided to revisit that ol' tutorial and come up with something that covers it all! 

&#x200B;

A little background on who I am. I'm Yaad, I've been doing calisthenics for over 12 years. I've managed to do a 50 second front lever, which is really close to the world record! I'm extremely passionate about calisthenics and have even studied medicine to further develop my understanding of how the body works and how to treat injuries when it comes to calisthenics. I'm currently a medical doctor practicing internal medicine and cardiology as a resident. The goal is to eventually specialize in sports medicine! 

&#x200B;

In this video I'll go through several topics:

\- What is the front lever? (going through the form requirements)

\- What is strength? (explaining what strength, and apply that information to calisthenics)

\- How to build muscle (explaining what muscles are used in the front lever and how to best train hypertrophy)

\- How to do skill work (one of the most important things when it comes to any calisthenics movement)

\- The program (a guide for the free program that I've included in this video)

&#x200B;

If you guys have any questions regarding the program, please go ahead and ask. I will do my best to answer them!

I (67 kg, 21yo, 172 cm) am from Syria and the situation here is very dire economically, I can't really control my diet (live with family) or afford high protein foods (rarely eat meat, egg, milk or high protein vegetables). 

I started working out in March, I was at 74 kg, 0 pull-ups, 4 push-ups, all in all, very weak. 

I didn't really control my diet (living with family, so I eat what is for launch), I just started working out, cutting sugar and extra olive oil (high in calories and very common in our food) and running 3 times a week. 
3 months later I was down to 64 kg, and that's when I stopped the 'dieting' and cardio and sort of ate what I can, I wasn't at my target BF%, but I was tired of the very slow progress. 



Fast-forward to now, I am at 67 kg, didn't progress as fast as I should have, but I am getting stronger (now at 5 pull-ups, 8x3 dips, working on one-armed push up and L-sit).





I am in this weird limbo where if I want to bulk (progress faster, utilize the winter month), I might be able to increase calories (bread and olive oil are stable in our diet and high in calories) but I rarely hit +20g of protein per day, maybe once a week I may hit 1g per 1 kg of my weight and that's it, so I think this will gain me just fat and no muscle since my protein intake is so low.

Or I can start cutting (dying to get finally lean and see my abs), but I am terrified of losing too much muscle due to skinny-mosquito levels of protein. 





I am really confused on what should I do, and any tip would be greatly appreciated.

TIA

Greasing the groove saved me (34M) post surgery.,sonaked,583,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/rs42lf/greasing_the_groove_saved_me_34m_post_surgery/,1640877379.0,"WARNING: long read. So almost a year ago now I went into surgery for multiple injuries to my bicep and shoulder. It all started as a result of a 10 year old workplace injury, but as time marched on it led to more issues. I got bicep tenodesis surgery, shoulder labrum surgery, and had my collar bone shaved so they could clean up my ACL along with the bursas drained.  

Frankly, post surgery was awful. I’ll save you those details. It’ll suffice to say when I was cleared to start working out regularly (after following my physical therapy to a T) I did. But I was so embarrassed at my strength. I left the gym one day and cried in my car because of how weak I became compared to others. I couldn’t go back.

The toughest part was losing pull ups, my favorite exercise. I majorly struggled with pull ups, one because all that upper body strength was gone, but two because mentally I felt I couldn’t start over again. And then, as if a light bulb turned on, I remembered greasing the groove. 

So that’s what I did. I started hanging from the bar a few times a day. Shit, even that took work. Then I’d attempt one pull up. Then two. Then three. Then four. And so on. Knowing I wasn’t going anywhere near failure gave me the space to accept my weakness, because I knew I’d just try again later. And it felt so easy, so accessible, that not only was that mental block gone, but the strength to do full pull ups bounced right back. 

I still have some issues. Push ups are taking a long time to recover. And some exercises still feel funny. But without greasing the groove, I don’t know if I’d ever have gotten the confidence back to just…try. 

So with that said, thanks. I don’t know where I’d be without such a simple concept. 

TL;dr: GTG helped my recovery

Edit: just wanna say thanks for the kind words, and for everyone else who’s in recovery you can message anytime. I know I had trouble talking to people about how I felt so if I can spare someone that feeling so much the better"
3 things I learnt | From 0 to 8 strict muscle ups in 12 months (continued),eatsleephustle,582,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/d6suty/3_things_i_learnt_from_0_to_8_strict_muscle_ups/,1568974843.0,"You may remember from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a9fkad/3_things_i_learnt_from_0_to_8_strict_muscle_ups/) where I shared my 1 year journey from not doing one muscle up to doing 8 of them in a row. I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrZQ_tRoIrk&t=1s) a while ago on how I learnt the muscle up and why I think it is effective to follow the method I proposed.

>***Tl;dr - don't bother training the transition, do EMOM to get to 10 pull ups, after that train for power and not endurance.***

&#x200B;

**1. Don't bother the transition**

Most beginners think they can't do a muscle up because they can't handle the transition. But the reality is that only advanced trainees who are looking to clean up their muscle or learn slow muscle up would train specifically for the transition. For beginners, your first muscle up must be one with kipping (unless you can already do oac or other advanced pulling moves). And kipping means you pull and kip so high that you skip the transition entirely. So don't bother the transition, focus on training high pull ups and kipping.

&#x200B;

**2. Getting to 10 pull ups**

Most people say 10 pull ups is your entry ticket to a muscle up and I certainly agree. For myself, that's the most pull up I can do when I did my first muscle up, and those pull ups aren't even that strict. I used the [every minute on the minute method (EMOM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrZQ_tRoIrk&t=1s) to get to ten pull ups. The method is like this:

A. Do 2 pull ups at the start of a minute

B. Then rest

C. Do another 2 pull ups at the start of another minute

D. Repeat A to C until you get 30 pull ups

The above parameters are set on the assumption that your max pull up is 5. You can adjust the intensity (number of reps per min; rest interval; target reps) according to your max reps. For progressive overload, either adjust your target reps, e.g 40 pull ups, or adjust your rest period, e.g. 2 pull ups per 50 seconds or even 40 seconds.

&#x200B;

**3. Do low reps high pull ups for power**

Once you get to 10 pull ups, your max repetitions become less of a concern. There's little point training for 15 or even 20 pull ups cos you would be training more endurance than strength that way. Muscle up is a power/strength movement. Instead, you should be training high pull ups (at least chest to bar). The rep range for training power/strength should be kept to 2 to 3 reps per set as your explosiveness will usually drop drastically after 2 to 3 reps. Do more sets (7 to 8 sets) per workout and less reps per set.

Working out in a well frequented calisthenics park was a game changer for me,chubby_charlie,580,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/c8su2s/working_out_in_a_well_frequented_calisthenics/,1562184023.0,"I have worked out with BWF and weights for some time, about one year each. Back then I almost strictly trained for hypertrophy which didn’t work out because it’s really hard for me to gain weight. I did not actually enjoy working out a lot after some time (never got a body „high“) and mostly went through with it with discipline, then stopped when I moved. Half a year later, and I have been doing calisthenics for the last month or two, seeing the biggest improvements I ever had. This might be partly due to muscle memory, but I believe that the main reason is that I’m now training in a popular park in my area that changed my entire perspective. It’s the most fun I’ve ever had working out, and it’s not because I actually changed a whole lot.

The thing is that working out before was a pretty lonesome ritual for me. I went to the gym and Went through my plan, then left. I sometimes talked a little to people, but it was nothing compared to what it’s like now. In the park, there are almost at any time of the day at least 3 people, with around 10 - 20 at busy times which is similar to a gym. But the thing for me is that everything feels so much nicer compared to that. The people are nice and open for conversation and because everybody tries to learn similar drills (muscle ups, handstands, flags), you already feel like you have a lot in common without even talking to anyone. In a matter of weeks I found a workout buddy (without actually trying) and we now share equipment and give each other tips. Someone let me use their resistance bands and chalk which gave me a huge boost in performance after I bought them for myself, and for the first time in my life, I’m actually close to getting a muscle up, and my handstands got a lot more consistent. My motivation is higher than ever before and I love going out (especially now with amazing weather) to the park. 

I can only recommend you to check out if there are local parks near you (https://calisthenics-parks.com) and if so, definitely go there, you’ll probably have a great time!"
An underrated benefit and progress of a different kind,quite_worried,578,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nie6ch/an_underrated_benefit_and_progress_of_a_different/,1621672758.0,"Bodyweight exercise is of course so great for your strength and mobility, but something I don't see mentioned too much is how well it trains your awareness and control of each muscle / movement. 

I love seeing the crazy progress you guys make and the really difficult skills, but for me it's a lot slower and more basic. So to have gained so much control over my body is really rewarding for me when I think back to where I started. 

A few years ago, if I was told to ""tighten my core"" I had no idea what to do. Do I tense my pelvic floor? My glutes? Suck my stomach in? All of the above!? But doing exercises like dead bugs, hollow body, etc has taught me to individually control them all. I used to think it was impossible to tense your core with no glute activation but now I see that they can all be separately controlled. It probably sounds really dumb to you guys but as someone who was sedentary for many years it's such a cool thing to me. 

Similarly with your shoulder blades, just being aware if they are up / down, forward / back is awesome. When I started pull-ups I didn't even think about it, I just grabbed the bar and pulled. But now I can choose if I want to use my forearms or my back more, I recognise when my shoulders are down for pulling, whether I'm rounding my back at the top, etc. 

Lastly, and possibly the most important, pelvis position. I have quite bad anterior pelvic tilt which has made some exercises tricky. When I first started, I genuinely thought doing a hollow body hold was easy (which for many of you it probably is, but for an absolute beginner no way!). Turns out I was doing it with a massive arch in my back, so I could hold it but I was putting so much strain on my lower back that I hurt it for a long time. When I finally went back and learnt how to do it properly, with my pelvis forward (or neutral at least) I couldn't believe how difficult it was. Suddenly that position forced my core to do all the work, it feels great to do it the right way and no more injury. 

Well, I think most of these things would be fixed by having a trainer or a friend with this knowledge, but it's been quite a journey on my own. This sub has been awesome and inspiring, thank you."

So here I am trying to share some of my progress and maybe inspire someone :)

( I tried to write as clearly as possible, English is not my native language )

**Start:**

All started with a free app on my cellphone a 7x4 challenge(7 days a week for 4 weeks, no equipment required), was a really good start to gain some general arm and core strength, at first I couldn't do any diamond push-ups for example, and barely do 10 push-ups but as time passes I started to see some really good progress.

**Resume from these 4 weeks:**

1. Push-ups from 4-8 to 15 at least
2. Weight went from 46kg(101lbs) to 49Kg(108 lbs)
3. Starting to see some abs and a few defined muscles.

**Some pictures:** [https://imgur.com/a/LeSuKia](https://imgur.com/a/LeSuKia)

At this point I was starting to get motivated, seeing people on youtube doing things like the planche, front lever, and those advanced moves got me really hyped so at this point my new goal was to train hard to reach some of these movements.

What now, I finished these 4 weeks and didn't know what to do, so I started to investigate I found this youtube channel and app with I think a really good progress overload and seems very challenging so that's when it started again but now with a certain routine.

**First mental lock:**

I thought that strong enough to jump into the intermediate program and that I was able to do at least 5 pull-ups/chin-ups or 5 dips, not even close, couldn't do any, and 3 miserable dips, I got frustrated, was a painful reality, they were very difficult days for me since I thought that I had improved much more.

Determined to improve I started from the lowest program of this application.

**Beginner Program 8 Weeks:**

Doing basics, a lot of push-ups, abs, started doing legs workouts for the first time, but the best was Australian pull-ups, and at this point, I started to learn and do negatives of every exercise and that's when I started to see some really good progress and get strong.

3 weeks into this program and I do my very first pull-up and not 1 but 3, I've never felt so happy in my life.

**Resume from these 8 weeks:**

1. 2-3 dips to 8-10.
2. 0 pull-ups to 7-10.
3. Weight went from 49Kg(108lbs) to 53Kg(116lbs).
4. My back got bigger, I could see a V shape on my body, abs more defined, shoulders, biceps, and forearms too.
5. The first thing that I learned was L-Sit(on the floor), the best time around 14-18 seconds.
6. Starting to learn Handstand and V-Sit.
7. Doing many stretching exercises in parallel

**Some pictures around week 6:** [https://imgur.com/a/kz2VRWS](https://imgur.com/a/kz2VRWS)

**Intermediate Program 8 Weeks:**

This is where I'm currently at(week 3), a very challenging first 2 weeks.

2 days ago was my first free handstand for 15 seconds, after around 1 month of daily training against a wall.

Link of the handstand: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMG2aXYm2Ak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMG2aXYm2Ak)

Record of 13 pull-ups, 12 dips, and 15 chin-ups, at this point, I can do at least 30 push-ups.

Very happy with the overall results, and want to train more!

**Pictures of the actual me:** [https://imgur.com/a/elS8srX](https://imgur.com/a/elS8srX)

**Conclusion:**

If I can you can! start always with the basics, don't rush and be progressive, focus more on quality and not quantity, it is better to do 1 perfect pull-up than 10 bad ones, everything comes with time and effort. No equipment? excuses, be creative, grab what you can, and do your best! negatives are the best thing you can do to achieve an exercise according to my experience.

The best of my luck to everyone out there!

Neck Training With Calisthenics: A Guide To Building a Stronger Neck With No Equipment,Prowland12,576,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10yop1u/neck_training_with_calisthenics_a_guide_to/,1676025400.0,"**Intro**

Strengthening your neck muscles is an overlooked part of a training regimen. It insulates you from injuries during high-impact activities, and affects your upper body aesthetics. With the right bodyweight exercises, you can build a strong and healthy neck without the need for any equipment. In this post, I'll go over best practices for safe and efficient progression in your neck training. 

**For Best Results**

Neck and upper traps have a lot of overlap,  I suggest training them both at the same time to maximize results. Make sure to stretch your neck and traps after exercising them to avoid being tense. [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/viayu5/upper\_trap\_training\_with\_calisthenics\_a\_breakdown/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/viayu5/upper_trap_training_with_calisthenics_a_breakdown/)

**Important Things To Know** 

* **Equipment is not needed.** The muscles of the neck are actually some of the easiest and most convenient to train, since you can do all the key exercises with no equipment, while either laying on the floor or hanging off the edge of a bed. 
   * This no-equipment style of neck workout was a staple of training for old-time strongmen and wrestlers such as Martin ""Farmer"" Burns, famous for a stunt where he survived hanging himself due to his absurd neck strength.  I am not always one to claim that ""old school"" did it better, but in this case the old school athletes seemed to have figured it out. [https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2019/08/27/the-pioneers-martin-farmer-burns-the-godfather-of-pro-wrestling/](https://lastwordonsports.com/prowrestling/2019/08/27/the-pioneers-martin-farmer-burns-the-godfather-of-pro-wrestling/) 
   * This should be obvious, but **do not try to replicate that stunt.** 
* **Neck bridges are not needed**. Neck bridges put extra strain on the fragile vertebrae of your cervical spine, while being entirely unneeded to have consistent neck strength gains. They are uncomfortable, risky, and are harder to progress/regress than other options. Instead I'll be showing some much lower risk exercise options.

**Adding Resistance**

Progression for neck training should be focused on fatiguing the muscles rather than maximum load.  Therefore, prioritize *training volume, slowing tempo and pauses, increasing ROM, and shortening rest periods between sets.* 

 If you do still wish to load the neck, a light resistance band and/or resistance from placing your hands on your head as muscular resistance is  very simple and easy to implement. Add load very *gradually.*  Here is an example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWKMy4BETQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWKMy4BETQM) 

Highly advanced trainees can feel free to use small weight plates (2-6 kg), but if you're someone with a large and heavy head it's unlikely you'll ever need anything more than just bodyweight and perhaps a light band.

**Gold Standard for Progression**

Slow sets of 15-20 reps at a paused tempo of 1-3-1-1, perform all neck exercises as a giant set running through each exercise 1 time with no rest between for 2-4 rounds. 

The majority of people, if they are strict with form and not allowing their neck to relax during the giant set, will find this quite challenging. If you still manage to progress beyond this, then you should consider adding load.

**Neck Exercises** 

Regardless of the variation you use, make sure to train all the key movements of the neck like you would the muscles of your core: rotation, side bending, forward bending, and backward extending.

My proudest moment in my bodyweight fitness journey. 100 navy seal burpees in 16 minutes.,---Tsing__Tao---,578,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/pelew8/my_proudest_moment_in_my_bodyweight_fitness/,1630340414.0,"Hello everyone,

I posted a couple of weeks ago describing my journey in the burpee and bodyweight fitness world. My ultimate goal was to be able to do 100 perfect form navy seals in under 25 minutes. I initially broke that and did it in under 21 minutes. 

But strangely enough I felt like that wasnt even close to where I can get so for the next two weeks I trained solely to improve that time. I used a lot of motivation from this group and some other fitness groups because it was hard.

I ended up absolutely destroying what I thought was possible and did it in 16 minutes. I went as hard as i could from the start and solidified my progression.

If you want to watch the video its on my youtube channel, as always if anyone can critique my form and let me know at any point where I can improve I would greatly appreciate it!

I successfully starting doing multiple sets of wall assisted pushups, and got to where I could do over 100.  So I moved to doing pushups using my kitchen/bathroom cabinets.  I've now worked myself up to over 100 of those. (Not at one time, mind you, but 5 sets of 20)

I'm also doing bodyweight cardio using YouTube videos by Joanna Soh, who has some wonderful bodyweight exercise videos.

I know that many people may say ""big deal...it's a push up"" - but i'm well on my way to doing a regular, good form push up on the ground.

In the video, I get a lot of aerobic exercise, along with squats.  

Oh and I've been walking just about every day for at least 30 minutes.  I feel better than I've ever felt!"
My three year progression on the salmon ladder,Mapes,573,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7g5hyn/my_three_year_progression_on_the_salmon_ladder/,1511887958.0,"This progression post will be slightly different from the typical progression submissions to /r/bodyweightfitness, but I really wanted to share my progress as well as answer any questions dealing with American Ninja Warrior or the salmon ladder!

For the unaware, the [salmon ladder](https://i.imgur.com/Gp6Cbzj.jpg) is an obstacle made famous by both [Sasuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_(TV_series) and [American Ninja Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja_Warrior).  It is a bodyweight obstacle in which an athlete must move up a set of rungs with a moveable bar.  It requires technique, strength, and endurance.

Three years ago I was encouraged by friends to apply to American Ninja Warrior.  I started a bodyweight fitness workout regiment and went to work!  Over the years I've progressed greatly and have competed on the show.

I was always intrigued by the salmon ladder.  It's the one obstacle I train the most on.  It blends calisthenics, endurance, and coordination.  The first day I attempted the salmon ladder I failed 40+ times... I eventually made it up successfully, and have continually progressed my salmon ladder skills over the years.  Here are a couple quick progression vids:

I tend to push the boundaries with the salmon ladder and I continually develop new techniques and maneuvers that have never been performed before.   I owe a lot of my calisthenics gains to the salmon ladder.  Once you get the technique down, it's an incredibly fun obstacle to train on!  I understand many of you don't have access to a salmon ladder, but with the increased popularity of the show many ninja gyms are popping up as well as established gyms are building their own salmon ladders.

Sandbag Training: An Alternative to Free Weights,Prowland12,576,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/w5ns7q/sandbag_training_an_alternative_to_free_weights/,1658530045.0,"# Sandbag Training: An Alternative to Free Weights

*For the sake of clarity, I will be referring to the duffel-bag shape of sandbag, as seen here.*  [*https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a757400/sandbag-exercises/*](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a757400/sandbag-exercises/)

Calisthenics is a great way to train, but there are many gaps in pure bodyweight training that can be easily filled by using some sort of external load. Generally, it's recommended to train with what I will call the ""Big Three"" of free weights: barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells.

The Big Three are excellent. They're highly effective pieces of weight equipment that have stood the test of time. The problem is that each of them is specialized. If you do not have the benefit of accessing all three, you miss out on a large number of exercises.

However, there is a reasonable alternative for those who are training at home, traveling, or who simply want a cost-effective and space-saving piece of equipment. The humble sandbag. Below I'll explain why a sandbag is a piece of equipment that I would pick on a desert island if it was the only thing I could train with. I'll also give advice on how to get the most out of sandbag training.

# Benefits of Sandbags

* *Unstable Load*
   * The primary benefit of sandbag training comes from working with a shifting/unstable load. I often think of sandbags as being similar to the gymnastics rings in that their instability lets you  get a strong stimulus with less weight than a more conventional option like a barbell. The load is quite challenging, forcing you to engage your stabilizers and postural muscles to keep it in place.
* *Exercise Versatility*
   * The shape and properties of a sandbag make it versatile enough to replicate nearly all of the exercises available from the Big Three, while also giving access to unique sandbag-specific exercises.
* *Carryover* *to Calisthenics*
   * Sandbag training can improve your grip strength, core stability, mobility, scapula strength, and coordination.  All of these are immediately useful in taking your calisthenics strength to the next level.
* *Benefits of Free Weights*
   * Sandbags can be used for legs and posterior chain training, compound lifts, isolation/accessory work, explosive strength, anaerobic conditioning (HIIT workouts), and unilateral exercises.
* *Convenience/Affordability*
   * Sandbags require merely a sturdy container (bag) and sand or a similar filler material. The bag can be made [DIY style](https://youtu.be/HTM89cD8I0c) from materials at home, or purchased from a retailer online.
      * Make sure your sandbag has handles, it gives you more options for exercises (See Grip Options Below).
* *Non-Rigid Shape*
   * Because a sandbag is softer and more pliable than a rigid metal weight, there are certain ways you can load the sandbag that normally would be very uncomfortable or require additional padding.
   * Common examples are loading the hips during hip thrusts, the knees during a bent leg calf raise, and the shoulder during shoulder squats.
* **Note:** I recommend a sandbag that weighs somewhere from **40 lbs/18kg to 80 lbs/36 kg** as a ""starter sandbag"".
   * I recommend using playground sand or an equivalent for the filler material, it is dense and very cheap.
   * A sandbag lighter than 40 lbs/18 kg will quickly become too easy for many exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and lunges.  A sandbag heavier than 80 lbs/36 kg will instead be too heavy for the lighter accessory exercises, and may be too bulky to use for some exercises, depending on how large you are.
   * Ideally, fill the sandbag with 2+ filler bags (smaller sealed bags within the sandbag) so you can quickly load and unload the bag in increments. This will give you more exercise options and make transporting the bag easier.
   * 80 lbs/36 kg seems like a low amount of weight, but the sand is constantly shifting and unstable, making this much more challenging than the equivalent amount of weight in a solid piece of equipment. Trainees who have become very strong and accustomed to the starter sandbag can graduate to a heavier one in between **80 lbs/36 kg to 160 lbs/72 kg**.
   * Any sandbag beyond that weight (**160 lbs/72 kg)** is extremely bulky and is mostly useful for very heavy exercises and strongman training. [An example](https://youtu.be/07xQXw--QQs) (yes I know it's a Rogue ad, but it demonstrates my point).

# Training with Sandbags

**This section contains advice on how to hold the load during sandbag exercises, as well as how to make them more challenging.**

**Sandbag Holds**

* There are many different ways to hold a sandbag, but here I will list the most common ways to hold the bag. Different positions allow you to make the same amount of weight more or less challenging, and can be used for different exercises.

1. [Bear Hug](https://youtu.be/eMJ4g9eQ5vs): This is a hold unique to the sandbag, where you hold the bag against your chest and squeeze it in place with your arms.  The weight is close to your center of gravity, similar to the [goblet](https://youtu.be/MeIiIdhvXT4) position with a dumbbell or kettlebell. The Bear Hug is easy to load heavily, and is great for lower body pressing movements (squats, lunges, calf raises), explosive movements, and carries.
2. [Front Load:](https://youtu.be/1Nl6CYG5zgc) This hold position is where the bag is loaded on the front of your body. The weight is front-loaded onto your upper body in a position similar to the [zercher](https://youtu.be/vpy4ADmlo1E), [kettlebell double front rack](https://youtu.be/4FSpYh2NS8I), and [barbell front rack position.](https://youtu.be/icXpnebjmMU)  The Front Load can be used for the same exercises as the Bear Hug, as well as a few other exercises such as hip hinges. It is usually a more challenging position than the Bear Hug.
3. **Grip:**
   1. [Neutral Grip](https://youtu.be/Gm_fcT0yL4w): The default grip for sandbag exercises. The hold is similar to the neutral grip variations for [dumbbells](https://youtu.be/9Izvhvyz4vo) and kettlebells. Most sandbag [pulling exercises](https://youtu.be/zlPDMykne5w) use a neutral grip, unless otherwise specified. If you choose to use a closed grip for [pressing exercises](https://youtu.be/OZT20vP92ls), neutral grip is generally recommended. If you are uncertain how to grip the sandbag for a specific exercise, neutral is a good starting point.
   2. [Pronated](https://youtu.be/28yKo5s2xww) **(Overhand):** This is the second most common grip after neutral grip. Pronated grip can be used on most pulling exercises such as [pullovers](https://youtu.be/Bj9UTtNT6bU) and is also used for [snatches](https://youtu.be/e5F9C5pfW-Q) and similar explosive exercise exercises like high pulls.
   3. [Supinated](https://youtu.be/ENnazvm1R6o) **(Underhand):** This is the the least common of the three main grips, but still used for bicep-heavy exercises such as supinated rows or [curls](https://youtu.be/DzsUZh9UUk0).
   4. [Offset Grip](https://youtu.be/qT1TXslRcOo)**:** This is the first specialized grip. The purpose of the Offset Grip is to shift *more of the load to one side of the body,* making it a challenging unilateral exercise. Think of it as being similar to an archer row or archer pushup, where one side is forced to work harder than the other.  Offset Grip can be used for most of the exercises using the three main grips. The benefits of the Offset Grip are that it can make an exercise unilateral and much more challenging.
   5. [End Grip](https://youtu.be/0uRANy1kcSI):  This is the second specialized grip. The End Grip is another way to make an exercise more challenging because the leverage is worse, the center of the bag is further away from you. Generally I see this used with pulling exercises, such as rows.
   6. [Crush Grip](https://youtube.com/shorts/7dCRwWNkL4c?feature=share) The third specialized grip. The Crush (or Squeeze) Grip is like the Bear Hug, except the sandbag is out further away from the center of your body. It can be used as a more challenging neutral grip alternative for certain exercises like hammer curls or overhead extensions, and also as a starting point for [pulling the sandbag into Bear Hug](https://youtube.com/shorts/Y5sE9Tdf62w?feature=share) in some explosive movements.
   7. **Open Hand (Press):** The fourth specialized grip. The Open Hand grip is an alternative option for pressing the sandbag instead of the neutral grip. Put your hand under the sandbag in the same position as you would for a pushup or handstand pushup, with an open hand and spread fingers. This grip does not make a difference in terms of how much weight you can lift compared to the neutral grip, but it may be more comfortable to press this way. It is also used in some exercises like the [toss and chase](https://youtu.be/iwIpR4btKbs).
4. **Suitcase:** This is one of the two positions used to load the sandbag for unilateral exercises. The suitcase hold is used for exercises such as lunges, suitcase deadlifts, and farmer carries. There is a different in the difficulty when loading on the same side as the working muscles versus the opposite side. The suitcase hold is generally the less challenging unilateral hold compared to the shoulder hold.
   1. [Same Side](https://youtu.be/OVDsMRuKkVM): Less cross-body resistance.
   2. [Opposite Side](https://youtu.be/S4Kmq1wR0Uk) More cross-body resistance.
5. **Shoulder:** This is the second of the two positions used to load the sandbag for unilateral exercises. It can be used for similar movements to the suitcase hold. Generally, the shoulder hold is the most challenging way to unilaterally load a lower body movement or a carry.
   1. [Same Side](https://youtu.be/dsaA6o0uqE4): Less cross-body resistance.
   2. [Opposite Side](https://youtu.be/vIgxtKrieto): More cross-body resistance.
6. [Overhead](https://youtu.be/fHI6LXbo2E8): This position is how you hold the sandbag for things like overhead squats, carries, etc.

* **Avoid Loading on The Upper Back:** I recommend to not load the sandbag [in this position.](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a753971/sandbag-squat/)  This is something I see quite often, because people are so used to loading barbells this way for exercises like back squats. The size and awkwardness of the sandbag means the load ends up dumping forward and putting unwanted stress on your upper back and neck.
   * I have found the side shoulder position to be a pretty similar load without the drawbacks of pressure on my neck/upper back. When trying to replace back-loaded barbell movements, try the side shoulder position with the sandbag.

**Leverage**

Besides the various ways to hold the sandbag, we can also alter our body positions much in the same way we do with calisthenics to make a sandbag exercise more challenging.

* Standing: Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart is the ""default"" standing body position.
* [Staggered Stance](https://youtu.be/OImOfyvdirI): Put the feet in a slightly staggered position to increase difficulty, back heel is elevated. Good for lower body exercises like the deadlift, as well as upper body exercises like the overhead press.
* Wide Staggered Stance: Like the staggered stance, except the gap is 1.5 to 2 lengths of your feet between your front feet heel and your back foot's toe. Useful for all the exercises used for a Staggered Stance. This is a more challenging progression of the staggered stance.
* [Kneeling](https://youtu.be/jlY_8U8Agts): Instead of standing, you do the exercise on both knees. This is a method to take some of the lower body's power away during exercises like overhead presses, forcing you to rely more on your upper body and core. This is the same principle used for barbell exercises like the [Z-Press](https://youtu.be/0fHdnBH9Gdo), an overhead press accessory that makes the load more challenging.
* [Half-Kneeling](https://youtu.be/LJGoELRJOAA): A lunge position with the back knee touching the ground. This is a more challenging progression of the kneeling position.
* Lying: Lying on ground with back and legs flat, the ""default"" prone body position.
* [Bridge:](https://youtu.be/maRRqZxOifI) Lift your hips off of the ground like you are doing a glute bridge. This is more challenging than the lying position.
* [Unilateral Bridge:](https://youtu.be/aLS7Tx92q1E) Same as the bridge position, except you lift one of your legs off of the ground. This is more challenging than the bridge position.

**Progression**

* Because sandbag training works with many different variables, it is best to think of progression in terms of *increasing complexity.* You'll make better progress moving from simple variations to more complex variations than you will if you are just adding weight. Once you have mastered the most complex progression, add weight and restart the cycle.
* An example of a typical progression cycle would be with squats, shown below. I am also providing a progression cycle for exercises that are either very technical and/or an explosive movement. I generally recommend 2 sets of 10 reps for these exercises, because it can be very hard to hit 20 reps in a row without form breakdown.
* Unilateral Exercises are 1x20 reps or 2x10 reps *per side.* Take a break as needed to recover.
* **Progression Cycle (Standard)**
   * Exercise 1: Bear Hug Squat, progress to Exercise 2 when you can hit 1 set of 20 reps with good form (1x20).
   * Exercise 2: Front Squat, progress to Exercise 3 when you can hit 1 set of 20 reps with good form (1x20).
   * Exercise 3: Shoulder Squat, progress to Exercise 4 when you can hit 1 set of 20 reps with good form (1x20).
   * Exercise 4: Shoulder Staggered Stance Squat, after you can hit 1 set of 20 reps with good form (1x20), return to Exercise 1 and add weight to the sandbag. Repeat the cycle.
* **Progression Cycle (Technical/Explosive)**
   * Same as standard, except test at 2x10 reps instead of 1x20.
* **How Many Reps to Add/Test Days**
   * My rule of thumb is to add *1 rep per workout* for technical/explosive exercises, and *2 reps per workout* for all other exercises. The goal is to gradually increase *total reps* until the deload and test week, where you test your max reps for each exercise.

**Example Progression Chart**

|**Week #**|**Sets/Reps**|**Rest Time**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Week 1 (Workouts 1-3)**|1x2 , 1x3, 2x2|1.5 to 2 mins rest between sets|
|**Week 2 (Workouts 4-6)**|5x1, 3x2, 3x2+ 1x1|1.5 to 2 mins rest between sets|
|**Week 3 (Workouts 7-9)**|4x2, 3x3, 5x2|1.5 to 2 mins rest between sets|
|**Week 4 (Workouts 10-12)**|5x2+1x1, 6x2|1.5 to 2 mins rest between sets|
|**Deload Week**|Do Not Train on Deload Week|N/A|
|**Test Week**|Goal of 1x20 (standard) or 2x10 (technical/explosive)|2 to 4 mins rest between sets|
|***If You Do Not Hit Progression Standard***|Record total number of reps you hit on Test Week, divide that number into 4-6 sets. Retest when you feel ready. *Example:* 1x15 on test day, 3x5 on next workout|1.5 to 2 mins rest between sets or 2 to 4 mins rest between sets on Re-Test.|

**Pairing with Other Equipment**

* Depending on the design of your sandbag, you will be able combine the sandbag with several other pieces of equipment.
   * **Resistance Bands:** Resistance bands can be attached to your sandbag for adding variable resistance, in a way similar to [a barbell.](https://youtu.be/JC2OI9Jr4xo)  It also can serve as a portable anchor if you need something heavy for your bands to attach to.
   * **Weight Sled Alternative:** Sandbags can be dragged as an [alternative to weighted sleds](https://youtu.be/Jt7bj71dsck) If you have a dip belt that has a long enough chain, you can attach a sandbag to the belt for drags [Example 2.](https://youtu.be/MaZKK6aWzWg)
   * **Weight Vest:** You can wear a weight vest [while using a sandbag for additional load.](https://youtu.be/8RKlT9m6ZyI)

"HANDSTAND MOTIVATIONAL MONTH 2017! Join us today, and get INVERTED.",iwillbemyownlight,570,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/73l3wu/handstand_motivational_month_2017_join_us_today/,1506856885.0,"**Welcome to Handstand Motivational Month 2017!** 

We're back! Regardless of whether you’re just starting out on your handstand journey, or you’re increasing that one minute figa to three, join in the various activities we have planned for this month. Discover why the world is prettier upside down, and let’s have fun standing on our hands together!

This week, we are looking at the mechanics and progressions for the handstand. Moreover, we’ll be setting personal goals for the month. 

**Introduction/Background Reading**

* [The Anatomy of a Handstand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGhGnk3l6-o) and [Hands as Feet and How It Relates to Balance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3v69_AFzZ8)

* [Comprehensive Handstand Tutorial](http://antranik.org/comprehensive-handstand-tutorial/)

* [Crow Pose MM](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5lgudw/welcome_to_the_crow_pose_motivational_month_the/)

**Warm Ups** 

We recommend performing some light warm up activities to get everything nice and warm, and to reduce risk of injury. Do your warmups, mobility work (especially for the wrists!), and progress safely.

* [Shoulder Openers](https://emmetlouis.wordpress.com/2014/10/04/fixing-arched-back-in-handstand/)

**Progressions**

Here are some progressions for your handstand practice. Please ensure that you’re comfortable with each progression in the list before moving on to the next.

1) 	[Front Support/Plank (60s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ScXWFaVBs)

2)	 [Hollow Hold (60s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ScXWFaVBs&feature=youtu.be&t=5m18s)

3) 	[Wall Plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jm4R3K4sJA): While wall planks are one way to build strength for HS, the goal is to [transition slowly to a CTW HS](http://bodyweightcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tyler_handstand3.png) with your shoulders directly over your wrists, rather than increasing hold times here. 

4) 	[60sec Chest to Wall HS](https://i.imgur.com/buP4BKG.png) 

 * How to exit a chest-to-wall HS? Walk your hands out or do the [""Pirouette Bail""](https://youtu.be/fOy7sE1_vI0?t=2m59s) (Protip: Don't hold the CTW HS to absolute failure so you have energy to exit safely.)

5)     [60sec Back to Wall HS](https://i.imgur.com/pbX2lbe.jpg)

 * How to enter a back-to-wall HS?  [Split Legs Kick up to HS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcXy4wzCF50&t=70s).

----

At this point, when you're comfortable with both a chest and back to wall facing wall-handstand, you could do re-balancing drills such as Toe Pulls and Heel Pulls:

6. 	[Toe Pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-7QXCsPL0) & [Heel Pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYehg2ruMN0).

7. 	[Freestanding HS (10-30s+)](https://i.imgur.com/2db5VD5.jpg)

8. 	FSHS Leg Changes: e.g. Straight legs to Tuck + vice versa. Straight to Straddle + vice versa.

11. [OAHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBg25G5ksbg) [+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B50c3TinDCQ)

----

**Goal Setting:**

• Improve your form 

• Increase your hold time

• Try different entries/exits

• Try different HS shapes/positions

• Improve pressing strength 

**Beginner FAQ**

*Can I do this even if I’ve never done a HS before?*

Yes! Read the progressions above and find a suitable level for yourself to work at. Post form check videos and ask if you need any help.

*But I'm too scared*

That's why you start with the wall planks and practice HS bails/exits.

*But my wrists hurt*

Then maybe your focus should be on the wrist mobility and hollow hold for now, so your wrists and core get stronger.

----

**WHAT TO DO**

DO practice getting comfortable in a chest-to-wall handstand. When you're comfortable there, you can start playing with kicking up into a back-to-wall HS.

DO practice your [kick up to handstand technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcXy4wzCF50), either against a wall, or freestanding if you're comfortable with bailing out and already have decent consistency. 10 reps per session is a good start.

DO choose a progression from the list that you're comfortable with to work on.  

DO NOT ever neglect the wrist warm up. Your wrists are the weakest link and your entire body weight is going on them, so please, respect them!

DO NOT only train banana back-to-wall handstands if you're just starting out. Aligned handstands will make it easier to transition to other skills. 

----

**DO leave a comment below with the following info:**

1.	Stats: What is your gender, age, height, weight?

2. 	Goal: What is your goal for this month? (e.g., Freestanding Handstand for 10 seconds)

3.	 Current Progression: What progression are you at? (e.g., Chest to Wall Handstand with fingers far from wall for 30s) What will you be working on? (e.g. Kick Ups + Heel Pulls)

4. 	Have a Form Check Video? They are highly encouraged. Every week, on Monday, we will have a check-in thread where you can tell us what's going on and get your questions answered.

My 2 Month Pike Press to Handstand Journey,Uninformed1diot,573,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/h9jhf8/my_2_month_pike_press_to_handstand_journey/,1592238111.0,"So I've been learning handstands for a little over a year now. I got to the point where I could do 30-60 second holds basically every time, along with having a (reasonably) nice looking bodyline. I also managed a few basic bent arm presses like the frogstand to handstand and tuck to handstand.


However, I could never get anywhere near any sort of straight arm press into the handstand. Even a straight arm tuck press was too much for my shoulders and I just didn't understand how to control the balance at all. 


But on the 12th of April, I decided that had to change and it was time to commit to getting some straight arm presses to handstand, with the pike press being the final goal.


I made a little video of my progression here:
 [My Pike Press Progression Video](https://youtu.be/HDc6WzonG7A)
I'm really pleased with how it turned out but don't feel like you need to watch it if you don't want to :)


Initially I just decided to mess around a bit and see what I could do. It turned out that that was not very much. I could do a messy looking jumping tuck to handstand and an even messier looking jumping straddle press but I was basically 100% reliant on the momentum, and even if I elevated my feet really high, I still had no idea how to statically lift them up. I thought maybe I had picked a slightly too ambitious goal here.


But after the first couple of days I decided to pay a visit to the land of YouTube tutorials and see what Gabo Saturno and Tom Merrick had to say about it. It turned out I had been thinking about it completely wrong. While I thought it was a move of shoulder strength, it turns out it's actually much more down to hamstring mobility and core compression strength. The basic idea is that you make the move as efficient as possible by trying to stack your hips on top of your shoulders and compressing with your hip flexors to allow your feet to float up seemingly (although not really) effortlessly and naturally. 


From then I knew that I had to work on my Pike and pancake stretches. My [initial pike](http://imgur.com/gallery/Yk9toKC) wasn't terrible. I could get my fists to the floor, although with a reasonably arched back. My pancake however was really terrible. I struggled to even get my legs wide enough to try it properly while sat on the floor, never mind trying to lean forward in the position.


I did low intensity stretching in my rests whenever I did a workout, along with pushing it a bit harder about 3 times a week at other points. I had never really done stretching before and I learned a lot about it, like not arching your back but trying to keep it straight to target the hamstrings more effectively. 


I found the pike stretching a lot easier to do, and as a result I focussed on it much more and made some very substantial pike stretch progress in a fairly short amount of time I could get my palms to the floor without too much arching after about 3 weeks.([3 weeks pike stretch progress](http://imgur.com/gallery/f2K4Szy) ) The pancake on the other hand was a completely different story. My pancake now is only marginally less bad than the one I had 2 months ago (I'm gonna try to work on it more I promise).


On the 2nd of May I managed my [first static straight arm press](http://imgur.com/gallery/BP4UtWA)  (with bent legs). Although admittedly I think I managed to brute strength it a bit. The pike and straddle presses still seemed impossible. At around mid-May, I lost motivation for these presses and decided to work on the planche instead. I kept up with my stretching just in case though.


I made some decent progress with the planche over the next month. I went from a decent tuck planche to a really bad form 1.5 second straddle planche. I worked a lot on my general shoulder strength with lots of pike push ups and tuck/straddle planche negatives. Over this time I still managed to improve my Pike flexibility and on the 9th of June I decided that even though I was nowhere near flexible enough for a straddle press, maybe it would be worth just trying the pike press and see what happened.


I watched a YouTube video for motivation and they mentioned very consciously compressing with your hip flexors to take your feet off the ground. I tried it about 30 times that day, getting closer and closer each time but almost always being too far leaned forward and falling. After about 20 failures, I finally had some success and [this happened](http://imgur.com/gallery/HKjYALH). I had managed my first pike press to handstand! After that I managed it a few more times and got a few much cleaner presses [like this one](http://imgur.com/gallery/rsa3dDv).


This is definitely the handstand skill I'm most proud of. I was so happy that I managed it after the hard work I put in. 


Thanks for reading about my little journey, I wish you the best of luck on yours :)"
I did my first muscle up!,elslyknight,572,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gd7qqy/i_did_my_first_muscle_up/,1588581030.0,"Hello Bodyweigthfitness fam! Hope you all are doing doing good in these days.

I just did my first muscle up yesterday! And I feel soooo amazinggg. [Check it out](https://i.imgur.com/PHL7yZ5.mp4)

It was shabby, with a kip, and kinda ugly, whatever describes a fresh new step. And I'm onto getting more and more, and better.

Background: Before lockdown I had been lifting since some 9 months now, whilst simultaneously being in my college soccer team, which had me doing super over-cardio with practicing 6 days a week. But my gym life was pretty nice where I worked out with a strength-training inclined regimen with lots of Squats, deadlifts and Pullups. 

In the past month, I discovered High Volume calisthenics and Prisoner style workouts and have developed a thing for the same. My current workout includes 6 Days a week push pull legs split as follows:

* Pull: 10X10 Pullups super set 10X20 deficit pushups, accessories (Pullups comprise of broken sets at 7+3 reps after 2-3 sets, I incoporate some 6-7 pullups grips/variations)
* Push: 10X15 Dips super set 10X10 Body rows, accessories 
* Legs: 5X10 Pistol squats (Assisted and clean both), 4XMax each of weighted Deep Step Ups, Lunges, Squats.

I believe the high volume here has helped me a lot in getting a higher threshold strength. Having all the Bench press, barbell rows, cable rows put to loads of pullups and dips, it has helped me a lot. My current BF is at around 18-20%, and I aim to cut slowly whilst having a decent hypertrophy regimen and developing body control too.

MY QUESTION IS, how do I take it further from here. I have decided to simply add 7-10 muscle ups to all 6 days (I don't mind a 10 sets of 1 muscle up, working out robustly has got me good results). I aim to get a clean strict muscle up. I want to know and discuss how do you suggest to format my routine for better results. All suggestions and criticisms are welcome.

I aim at having a good hypertrophy routine while cutting slowly, and not ***primarily*** prioritizing planche and levers and clean muscle up progressions, but I do wanna develop strength and control for those too. I currently am at a 15-20 sec strict low Dragon Lever, 3 and a half minute plank, but I don't practice those while still having a flab bulked physique. I do a good jump rope session 3-4 days a week.

EDIT: For many of you think that I do a pretty rigorous workout and achieved a MU after so long...well actually I never followed a MU progression 😅
I only tried a MU for the second time in my life that day when I achieved it. I only trained for strength-athleticism and hypertrophy."

**Introduction:**
>[Apathy](https://youtu.be/9J6J5BcHFCs?t=45s)

Most of it is covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3km2md/neos_progress_check_q1_3_months_of_bwfcc/). The usual stuff; depressed, weak, thin, not confident. When I was at school, I was the shortest guy in class. I was weak for 27 years of my life. And then I decided I don't want to be like that anymore. Exactly a year ago, the man in the mirror was weak but he had the courage to take action. I respect him for that. [I thank him for that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) And what I am doing now is for the man in the mirror 25 years from now. He *will* thank me for it.


**Training Routine:**
>[Without sweat, there is no Victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bD5TmyAKBU)

Very minimalistic routine. Push day with Dips and Pushups, Pull day with Pullups and Rows. (Leg days [??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFEoMO0pc7k)) Handstands at the beginning and Hellsits at the end of every training session. One rest day between each session. Every 4th week is deload week. 3x10 sets and reps and 3 minutes rest between each set.

Absolutely boring as fuck. I made this to see if I could follow a structured routine with discipline and handle the 4x per week, frequency of training for a couple of months. It has worked for me. But I don't recommend anyone follow this. There are better routines than this. ^^Hint: ^^Recommended ^^Routine

Everything I did, I recorded. And it is here on [my channel.](https://www.youtube.com/user/NeoN73T/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&view_as=public&shelf_id=3) Transparency ftw.
 
A word of caution. Chains make high pitched sounds when they are swinging around. And a bit of occasional horns from traffic nearby. Reduce or mute volume if you are a pussy and/or you are afraid that it might give you tinnitus. If you are a real man like me, enjoy the most beautiful sound you will ever hear. Heavy metal (puns) !

The chains and the metal rings have inertia and resist movement and twisting to certain amount. The same friction less plane of movement still exists but it is like doing them in a tank of molasses. I don't know how this changes the mechanics of the exercises, (by making them harder or easier) but I am making progress. And that is all I care about.

A tip to keep in mind while training. Try to move around the rings and not the other way, ie, move the rings around you. The are called still rings for a reason.

About handstands. Shoulder opening stretches are helping me get closer to the wall without falling over. Straighter the handstand, the easier it is. That awesome floating feeling, is so fleeting.



**Equipment:**
>[Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains](https://youtu.be/hUAie-X3u8I?t=1m22s)

>[Through Victory, my chains are broken](https://i.imgur.com/yY5Lijg.jpg)

>[And now I'm free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Sl2dAEh4w)

I absolutely love the fact that now I see this concept of breaking chains, everywhere. And here's the kicker, I'm achieving it with the help of *(drumroll please)* chains ! 

[Current](https://i.imgur.com/uPv5Wju.jpg) bwf equipment. My dad and I built a support frame. 2 concrete poles planted in the ground and a wooden beam connecting both at the top and chains hung from it.

Metal rings made by a local blacksmith and S hooks to connect them to the chains. Bicycle tire inner tube cut and taped for gripping and bike handle bar grips cut open for grip training à la fatgripz . Parallettes made with the usual specs found on the internet.

A couple of weeks ago I got a set of wooden rings made at a local carpenter to ""Olympic specs"". They turned out thicker and bigger than expected. But I don't really care. I'm gonna make a lightweight rings set with them and hang them from a daisy chain type nylon strap. I'm gonna use this for skills that require grip to move around. I'm gonna keep the heavyweight chains and metal rings set and use it for weighted stuff.

^*Whoops* Did I say weighted stuff ? Hell yeah I did. I got [these](https://i.imgur.com/rMF3iyW.jpg) also a couple of weeks ago. A 6 foot barbell, 2 adjustable dumbbells and 45kg of weight plates from a gym in my district hq. No more chicken legs. More info on what I'm planning to do with them, is in the goals section.


**Costs:**

Concrete posts and wooden beam - My dad ~~nicked~~ borrowed them from his office. He works as a pole to pole lineman in the local substation. - 0 Rupees

Metal rings with s hooks and bike grips - 200 Rs

2x10 feet of metal chain - 700 Rs

Wooden rings - 500 Rs

Parallettes - 1000 Rs

Barbell and adjustable dumbbells (new) and 45 kg plates (Used at 100 Rs per kilo ) - 5600 Rs

So 8000 Rs so far. Converted to freedom units it is around 120 Dollars. 1/3 on bwf and 2/3 on weights. Not bad. My family has decent financials but I don't like blowing money unnecessarily on things that can be made, and not bought. DIY FTW.



**Nutrition:**
>[Reject weakness](https://i.imgur.com/y7mPbXe.jpg)

I train on empty stomach right after waking up. If I feel like I don't have enough energy during training, I eat some dates or a banana. Post training, I eat a big meal of rice and potatoes with a fist full of roasted peanuts. And before sleeping, I eat another big meal of rice and yogurt, also with a fist full of roasted peanuts. I snack on dates if I get a bit hungry in between the meals. A couple of days a week, when I go out with friends, I eat whatever least processed/ most healthy food they have. Usually Gobi Manchurian or fruit salads.

I went on my first ever cut since mid March. Switched out peanuts with chickpeas and kept everything the same. Tried to cut out other extra stuff besides the big meals. Cutting is hard. I felt hungry and weak all the time. I don't think it affected the training but the psychological effect of being on deficit is really tough. Felt like being me a year ago. I'm so glad that it is now over. Fuck abs. If anyone needs me, I'm gonna be over at #permabulk4lyfe


**Training philosophy and other stuff:**

The way you think is the way you act. I am not ""working out"". I am training. Training to improve on what I already am. No other force on the face of this earth can stop me from training but me. I will stop the session only when *I want* to stop the session. That is how you build consistency and the discipline to stick to it and that consistency in turn became a habit.

Some of the best training sessions I ever had were the days when I didn't even want to train that day. I would just tell myself, lets just do warmup and then decide. After warming up, it would be like I already did the warmup why not do a handstand. Trust me when I say this. Handstands are the best caffeine shots/ pre workout you could ever get. And I don't even drink coffee. It wakes you the fuck up, right away. And then even if I didn't achieve any milestones that session, I was victorious in a way. Turned a lazy day into a training day.

The thing that I do with my mouth when doing Lsits and other stuff is my ""in the zone"" face. Or as I like to call it ""Rumination Mode Engaged""

I get a weird feeling when training sometimes. I don't know how to explain it. Like I'm on auto pilot. Watching from the third person. I get the same feeling when I used to go on hour long drives on my dad's bike through nearby villages. Very zen and in the zone. No other thoughts. I feel empty and at total peace. I'm sort of addicted to this and try to chase it session after session. 


When I went to the district hq to buy weights, I also checked with a PT about left shoulder clicking and pain at the bottom of pushup. She diagnosed it as rotator cuff tendonitis. And prescribed treatment is the usual stuff. Stop doing exercises that cause pain. Step down progressions and build it back up slowly. Avoid the range of motion where pain is present but keep mobilizing the joint. I'm gonna rest for a couple more weeks and start again carefully.

I am a bit bummed out that I didn't get to ride the puberty gainz train. But as they say, ""Its too late to workout only if you are dead"". And guess what, I'm not dead yet.

Turn your disadvantage into your advantage. My short height is now my strength in bwf. Shorter levers, lesser range of motion, more strength to weight ratio i.e, Manlets gonna manlet. 

Here are some good stuff about [training](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYdkxp9hJ4i7-gHy-Loh6lbxsLcsypuYN) and [nutrition](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYdkxp9hJ4i58l583rJV7r2LMAiYFJ9gm) from Team3DMJ that I found useful. Also [this](http://routineexcellence.com/)

**Appreciations:**

This thread (and my life really) is dedicated to my best friend Pavan. [Here he is.](https://imgur.com/a/0pSDG) He is strong as fuck from doing literally ""Farmer walks"". He used to carry 20 liter buckets of water in each hand from a overhead water tank to his home half a kilometer away, multiple times, every day. Massive forearms, [epic traps,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNbYUfuxKxI) excellent core stability, stronk legs. He likes doing epic stuff like kipups and backflips.

He is young, yet he has the wisdom and life skills of a wise old man. He has this indomitable mental fortitude aka stubborn as a mule. And he helped me when I needed the help most. He gave me hope when I was hopeless, joy when I was sad and most of all strength to fight life when I was weak. Every breath I take now is because of him. Thank you so much for everything you did dude.

And thank you to everyone who reads, contributes and moderates here. This place is awesome because of you. Yes. YOU :D

Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. Use only recycled pullup bars, and buy rings made from wood of sustainable forest management authorities. Don't waste water. Drink as much potable water as possible and piss it all back into the ground where it came from.

Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much."
"Let's all have a little moan, shall we? What's wrong with your local gym?",lastaccountgotlocked,570,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dmvb9r/lets_all_have_a_little_moan_shall_we_whats_wrong/,1571998111.0,"I had to join a gym. My tiny London flat ceiling isn't high enough for pull ups, and there's no kitchen corners for dips. The gym at work was cheap and nearby, but if you did a pull up, you banged your head on the roof before your chin even reached the bar. So I joined the 'proper' gym.

They've just refurbished the cardio section, to the tune of a small fortune. Same treadmills, same step machines, same exercise bikes - but [NOW THEY'VE GOT TELLYS ON THEM!](https://www.technogym.com/gb/run-personal.html)

Meanwhile, there is only one dip station in the entire gym, one set of rings (which are fixed in place and too wide for anyone to use). There are five pull up bars, but three of them are built into multigyms, so if someone is using weights, they're out of action, and a fourth is built into the one dip station.  Want to do wide rows on a bar? You'll have to use the squat rack - but someone's squatting on it, obviously. 

I like my gym, I really do. I asked if they could spare a few quid to install some p-bars while they were updating the cardio. No such luck.

Fellow BWFers who want a good moan, how does your gym hate on you?"
"Guinness world record for weighted chin up is 90kg. I did an 82.5kg chin up yesterday, a couple inches away from getting 85. I now realise I could potentially break it if i put my mind to it.

My bodyweight is a lean 89kg (10-12% i think, full 6 pack but don't have veins popping out everywhere so i'm definitely not less than 10) i've been doing heavy weighted chin ups as my sole back and bicep exercise for years now, i stopped doing rows about a year ago because I just hate them and feel I get enough lat work from regular weighted chins. Just did 5 heavy sets, usually 3x5 with whatever i could manage then 2 or 3 sets of higher reps for form reasons. been doing that 2 times a week for the last 3 years, before that i did it 3x a week, which is when i got up to 50kgx5, now i'm on like 65kg for 5 and honestly i hadn't realised this was exceptional till a few days ago, assumed there were people in actual hardcore gyms bashing out heavier chins all day, but it turns out not. I must just have very good leverage. this is deadhang, very very slight kick at the top, which is allowed according to the rules. 

Anyway, I want to get a 92.5kg chin up as soon as possible really. what sort of programming should i be doing? would be cool to be a record holder. 

Also, i squat like 200kg, i basically do very simple low rep powerlifting training, just because i like being strong, i don't do competitions, i'm not strong enough. i have a heavy lower body but i don't want to compromise my squat training. squats are my favourite lift by far."
Body transformation 4 years,MyTraininArc,568,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/15z2atl/body_transformation_4_years/,1692793241.0,"https://imgur.com/a/TUmlOal

Same exact weight, same lighting, no pump, same angle tried to replicate each picture as much as possible! This transformation took me 4 years of consistency and my goal the whole time was to just be stronger not to train for more muscle

My routine was dependent on goals that I had at the time for example, planches, levers, ect… and the focus was never to build muscle. It’s very easy to transform yourself into the person you’ve dreamed of it’s all about consistency 

As for diet, there was non, I went from fat to skinny to what I am right now, all for the purpose of learning how do eat, once you learn how to eat and how all of that works you can eat what you want! And now how to loose or gain weight

MOST IMPORTANTLY NO STEROIDS!!!!!! CAFFEIN IS THE MOST IMPORTANCE! People always accuse of me this hahah

How do I prove to my mother that training won’t stunt growth?,Mico_ward,572,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/izfjkf/how_do_i_prove_to_my_mother_that_training_wont/,1601020785.0,"Around 5 months ago I decided to start calisthenics and I’ve really enjoyed the journey so far, seeing improvements in strength and size really quickly. 

However, ever since I started, my mother would keep telling me that it will make me stay short (I’m 5ft 5-6 inches @ 17, which is already above average in my country) and “bulky”. It doesn’t help that she’s a medical doctor and believes she is absolutely correct on the issue. 

Despite the several studies I’ve shown her, she is more concerned with the “practical” and anecdotal evidence seeing that I have 2 different cousins who started weight training at my age and ended up quite shorter than his sibling. She also points out how short and stocky bodybuilders often are, neglecting the fact that Strongman competitors are often well over 6ft. She also likes to mention that my other friends who are lanky are taller because of their lack of weight training/exercise and that I should be stretching instead.

One reasoning she also made was that training “redirects” the body’s focus of growing taller to making muscle instead. 

 I could just ignore it but she’s been constantly feeding into my height insecurity to the point that I want to be absolutely sure that I can gain a couple more inches while still doing what I love, training. I could probably just wait until I’m older or maybe even train once a week instead but I’d rather make that a last resort. Any citations of anecdotal evidence, studies and even just reassurance is welcome."
Three exercises to improve your shoulder function immediately - Strengthening the scapular muscles to help prevent and improve shoulder dysfunction!,berimbolosforsatan,566,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qi97f0/three_exercises_to_improve_your_shoulder_function/,1635501004.0,"tl:dr: https://youtu.be/T3G2JdmtLiI

There are three areas that are often weak or dysfunctional in people who are experiencing shoulder pain. So it stands to reason, if we have three exercises to strengthen each of those three areas then it will improve our shoulder mechanics directly!

The shoulder is commonly referred to as a ball and socket joint, but let's be real - it's more like a cup and saucer. The shoulder joint, or if you want to get technical, the glenohumeral joint, is the point of contact between the humeral head and the glenoid fossa of the shoulder blade. 

When we move the shoulder, we want the humeral head to sit in the glenoid fossa of your shoulder blade. What is supposed to happen is that the scapular muscles are meant to contract to maintain this alignment as we move the arm. There are only two options to maintain this alignment - the position of the humerus and the position of the scapulae, or both. Ok, that's three, whatever. 

Think of all the large, powerful muscles around your shoulder: Your lats, pecs and delts. The scapular muscles are fighting against them to keep the humeral head in the glenoid fossa as we move our arm. If our scapular muscles are not strong enough to maintain alignment in the shoulder then it's a fast track to pain.  

There are three areas in particular that we need to focus on: the serratus anterior, the lower traps and the rotator cuff, specifically the external rotators. Weakness in each of these three areas has been identified as a contributing factor to many cases of shoulder pain

## External Rotators
Grab a light dumbell and place your elbow on top of your knee. The reason why we are doing it this way is because moving the elbow away from the body mimics the demands of normal shoulder movement on the rotator cuff. Keep your shoulder blades retracted and a have a nice tall posture and then rotate your arm. Make sure the only thing that is moving is your lower arm otherwise muscles other than your rotator cuff will take over. Do a couple of sets of about 8-10 reps.


## Serratus anterior
Research has shown that movements that maintain an upwardly rotated scapula, while performing scapular protraction elicited the greatest EMG activity from the serratus anterior(4). So what that  means for us is that if we elevate the upper arm past the shoulder line, we will get more activation of the serratus anterior. A great exercise, with an even better name is the dynamic hug. To perform a dynamic hug, you can use either a cable attachment, or a resistance band, but make sure you set it up at a position lower than your shoulder, to allow your arm to travel upwards as you do it. At first glance this might look like  a chest press, but look what is happening at the shoulder.  Two of the functions of the serratus anterior are to protract and upwardly rotate the shoulder blades. The benefits of the dynamic hug are in the end of the movement, as the arm is extended out, think about bringing both arms around something by protracting your shoulder blades. For further activation, make sure your arms are reaching out higher than shoulder height, as this has been shown to increase activation in serratus anterior. 

## Lower trapezius
To strengthen the lower traps we are going to do scapular pulls. One of the actions of the lower traps is to depress, or pull down our shoulder blades, which is exactly what movement is happening in the scapular pull.  This is also known as the active hang, and is the correct way to start every pull up rep. To perform an active hang, grab a hold of a bar with an overhand grip. We are going to raise ourselves as high as we can without bending our arms - the only way we can do that is by moving at our shoulder blades, so pull your shoulder blades down towards your back pockets as far as you can . This movement will raise your torso, hold the top position for a second, and lower yourself back down under control.

So there you go, three exercises that you can do every day to improve your shoulder mechanics!

I try and mix it up with variations but the most difficult variation for me has always been the navy seal so I made it my goal to do 100 in under 25 minutes while keeping the best possible form. 

Well today I SMASHED what I was hoping to do and did it in under 21 minutes. It was right at 20 minutes and 58 seconds (I think). It was the most difficult 21 minutes of my life but I did it! I recorded it incase was interested in seeing them. Please comment on my form and let me know of any areas I can improve!

Thank you everyone for your responses and messages on the first post, I read through every one. 

About a week after making that post, I learned that I have to do a fitness test before I leave for Officer Candidate School, as well as once I get there. Last weekend I did the test and was able to do 48 pushups and passed the test. I’m super happy that I went from a maximum of 35 to now 48. And I hope by the time I leave in about 3 weeks I’ll be able to do even more. 

To train I did 3 sets of 30 (or to failure) pushups, 3 times a day. The next day I would do 20 pushups at random points throughout the day, totaling around 200-250. I alternated these two workouts and took two days of rest per week. I made sure to stretch my arms and eat a lot of protein. 

Thank you so much for your help. I was very worried I wasn’t going to be able to do enough for this test since it was so soon after I made the post."

I‘m 26M, 186cm, 75kg. 

I work a desk job, mostly until the late evening, so morning workouts work best for me. 

I‘m not completely new to working out. I‘ve been doing parkour on a mediocre level for a few years. Since the pandemic this isn’t possible anymore, but I do have a small morning routine (~30 mins/on weekdays) before work. 

I‘ve been doing mostly bodyweight exercises, but I do also have modular dumbbells (up to 15kg). 

I want to take my workout to the next level. My goal is to make progress, which means building muscle and strength. I want to get out of status quo and see som progress. 

I read the FAQs and the recommended routine seems to be a good starting point, but I‘d appreciate some more recommendations on what else I could do. Also I don’t really have the opportunity to do rows. What would be the best way to solve this problem, since I can’t use any furniture here. Rings maybe?

I appreciate your help. Thanks!

EDIT: thank you so much for all the great comments! And my first ever rewards. I ordered rings and downloaded a nutrition app. I‘ll put together a plan and adjust as I go. I‘m very excited 😄"
It seems like Im getting bigger/stronger but stay the same weight,Juan-punch_man,570,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/o8u93l/it_seems_like_im_getting_biggerstronger_but_stay/,1624788300.0,"Im going to take you through my calisthenics journey in the past months.

Around september last year I was around 67kg and I was pretty weak - 15pull ups, one leg fl. Then I trained my brains out and around january I was 72kg. I looked at lot more muscular and was a lot stronger - half assed oac/oap, straddle fl. All seems fairly logical - I got stronger, bigger and put on a few kg all at the same time.

Then around april/may I got a lot better at FL and managed to do a full hold for a few seconds in good form. I even almost could do a full ROM row. But I was still at 72kg and didn't look visibly stronger. Which was strange. After that I got ill and I lost a lot of power and muscle mass.

And now in June Im at 70~71kg and I have almost regained all my FL strenght plus that I started training HS pushups and planche and have become a lot stronger in these moves. My arms and shoulders seem bigger too. 

This is really confusing for me. Im both stronger and more muscular BUT have lost weight? I've had the same amount of body fat since sept. I've always had trouble eating enough, only when I jumped from 67 to 72 was I able to eat properly. Is this normal or is my weight an indicator that Im undereating and hindering my progress?"

I am going to officer candidate school soon for the military, and I need to be in better shape. I leave in November, and unlike boot camp, they test you right as you arrive and if you fail to meet the minimums, you are rolled into a much later date. 

The struggle for me is pushups. As it stands the absolute max I can do at once is 35, and the minimum I need is 47. I have been slacking on training for them, and now I only have 1 month to get better. 

What would you guys recommend? I was thinking of doing 200 pushups throughout the day, every other day to give time for recovery. Is there any faster method?

Edit: I appreciate all the responses. I did not respond to a lot of them but I have read every single one and I am now very motivated to do some pushups. Thanks for all the tips."

**Tricia Woo**

A Nutrition Science major, Tricia did what we all joke about - she ran away to the circus. As seen in [16x9’s “Getting into Cirque”](https://youtu.be/PbVFDiijedk?t=1), she finds her way from college gymnast to Cirque du Soleil performer.

Despite her success as a performer, a ligament laxity contributed to serious injuries throughout her career. Multiple dislocations resulted in a double shoulder surgery in 2014 followed by a third surgery in 2018. Tricia understands the mental and physical difficulties of recovering from injury.

Although her shoulder may never fully recover, she continues to see the benefit of an active lifestyle and refuses to be limited by her physical restrictions.

**Chris McGreevy**

Chris is an acrobat, circus performer and artist. He represented Great Britain’s Sports Acrobatics team as a competitive athlete across multiple disciplines before transitioning into a career on stage.

Performing as a part of Cirque Du Soleil’s ‘Paramour’ and Franco Dragone’s ‘The House of Dancing Water,’ Chris is a specialist in hand to hand, aerial straps and has coached various other circus disciplines.

During his time at ‘The House of Dancing Water,’ Chris also assumed a role as part of the artistic management team. Due to this unique position, he can provide an insight into on stage, training and behind the scenes workings of a large scale theatrical production.

A case for sandbags,fabbe134,564,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ghriou/a_case_for_sandbags/,1589216484.0,"**The sandbag is the perfect addition to bodyweightfitness if you want to keep your home gym on a budget.**


So what is a sandbag? A sandbag is a bag with sand
There is a couple of different kind of sandbags you can buy/create. There are [sandbags with handles](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81B4u0%2BeckL._AC_SL1500_.jpg), my personal favorite [strongman sandbags](https://www.roguefitness.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1500x1500/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/t/strongman-sandbags-h1-new.jpg) or heck you can even make a [diy sandbag](https://beastlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/How-to-Make-a-Dirt-Cheap-Sandbag-to-Workout-Step-by-Step.jpg)


**How to make/buy them**

So making a sandbag is actually quite simple (and cheap) [here](https://vitals.lifehacker.com/how-to-build-the-best-weightlifting-sandbag-1830076035) is a great article on how you can make one for yourself.


Most rogue or big brand ones tend to be pretty expensive but definitely worth it if you think you’re going to use them for a long time in my opinion.


**Sandbags are extremely versatile**

So how can you make use of sandbags? I’ve used my sandbags for: 
[hip hinge strength](https://youtu.be/MDW78HRIc5s?t=126), [squatting](https://youtu.be/MDW78HRIc5s?t=156), [vertical pushing](https://youtu.be/8mZFYZycI84?t=7), [horizontal pulling](https://youtu.be/MDW78HRIc5s?t=86), and [carrying](https://youtu.be/mxtv4AnMk3k?t=15)


There is an endless of opportunities with a sandbag if you just get creative. 



**Unstable load = Gains**

So what’s the main difference between using a sandbag and a barbell? Well a sandbag that weighs the same is going to be a lot harder to lift because it is unstable. Just like how you can make dips or push ups harder with rings you can also, because a sandbag will roll and shift around in your hands, make squatting or deadlifting harder with less weight needed. 



**“Functional”**

As much as I hate the word “functional” fitness I must say that a sandbag has a closer resemblance to something you might pick up in real life compared to a barbell.


“If you can pick up a 300 lbs sandbag you can pick up a 300 lbs absolutely anything else” - [Brian Alsruhe](https://youtu.be/FyvZc0A0muc?t=15)


**How to incorporate in the RR**

Coming from a background of mainly doing squats, deadlifts and bench pressing the alternatives for squats and hip hinges haven’t been doing it for me. So in my case I have switched out all squats and hinges into sandbag front squats and sandbag rdls. And I tell you. Amraping a set of sandbag squats will exhaust the hell out of you. 
Other then strength training I have also used the sandbag for conditioning work. I have been doing timed carries plus timed sandbag “loads” (didn’t have a place to load them so just dropped to the ground) and these have been gassing me out pretty hard.


**What is a good size for me?**

The sizes I would recommend getting would be either an 150 or 100 lbs sandbag. It all depends on your bodyweight and strength. However if you can deadlift over 4 plates you should definitely be able to clean a 150 lbs sandbag. Otherwise I would recommend a 100 lbs one.


And if the sandbag is too heavy you can just pour out some sand(Wouldnt go less than 85% of weight though). So i would still recommend you to get a heavier if you're on the fence. 


**Downsides**

But my progressive overload? Yes progressing with a sandbag is a little more inconvenient compared to a barbell. Other than putting in more sand you can also make the movements harder by, just like in bodyweight fitness, changing the leverages. You can for an example: change your stance(bi-lateral), grip (shouldering, off-set) or tempo."
HANDSTAND: What did I learn during a year of training and struggling,Djanko_,563,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/w3peg1/handstand_what_did_i_learn_during_a_year_of/,1658331380.0,"Hi guys, I would just like to share with you my experience of learning the handstand in a year. I'm far from being the best and I've struggled a lot, so if you're in the same situation maybe my experience can be useful.

When I started working on handstand over a year ago, I already had a relatively solid “shape” thanks to several years of gym that I stopped to dedicate myself 100% to bodyweight. To give you some context, when I decided to start handstand, I was already able to hold a 10 seconds front lever and rep 10 muscle ups with strict form. Exercises that most part of you will find harder than a simple handstand...

However, it was a lack of strength that was a problem for me at the start of my progress. Add to this that I had never tried to stand on my hands, I was terrified of kicking it against a wall and you have one of the people who had the most trouble holding a damn handstand on this earth (ok I may be exaggerating a little but you get the idea).

That’s why, after a year of struggle, I think I can allow myself to share with you some advice that I would have liked to had when I started, in the hope that it can help some of you in their quest for the perfect handstand!

**The importance of straight arm strength**

My years of musculation have allowed me to acquire a correct strength, however in the majority of cases, this strength concerns bent arms movements (even more if you don't use the whole range of motion as I did…). This is how we end up with non-existent straight arm strength. I was simply unable to keep my arms straight and push off my shoulders in handstand position. Even against a wall I ""underwent"" the movement. You can see it here where my elbows are unlocked and my shoulders are sunk into my scapulars: [https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=29](https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=29) .

If you have this problem, I can only advise you to put the ego aside (which I obviously didn't do) and go back to easier positions like the pike hold and elevated pike hold to increase the difficulty, just to be concentrate on the fact of lock your elbows and push off your shoulders as much as possible.

I know that for most of you this may seem very easy or even natural, but for others like me it is really not the case and it is rare to work on straight arm strength in everyday life.

**Learning to fall**

The first times I wanted to try a handstand without any assistance I was confronted with my fear of falling. Although I knew how to fall and I had several times fallen without any problem but as you can see here: [https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=88](https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=88) , I don't kick hard enough. No matter how hard I try, a ""blockage"" in my brain prevents me from doing so.

Imagine that I was amazed to see people learning the handstand by trying directly free trials and falling forwards or walking on their hands, it was unthinkable for me!

I don't know if this problem concerns a lot of people, it's true that I'm not very reckless… However, if this is your case the only advice I can give you is to force yourself to fall by kicking too hard (yes I know at first it's complicated to cross the ""barrier"") but once you have it, do it several times in a row so that the brain integrates there is no danger. You can even do it with a mat or in the sand if you're a sissy like me there is no shame!

**Work on your shoulder mobility**

Ok so if your only goal is to stand on your hands regardless of your form, this step can be ""optional"", but as many calisthenic skills when we reach our goals we always want more, constant dissatisfaction when you hold us!

Because yes, there is a good chance that once you have mastered the balance you will realize that your handstand is not as straight as you hoped and looks more like a banana than anything else... You guessed it obviously it was my case! Look at this beautiful banana shape: [https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=105](https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=105) . Except that I had no idea where the problem came from, the majority of people told me that it was due to a lack of core strength. It is true that naively, when you can’t manage to stand straight you can easily think that the problem comes from there. But think again, this is rarely the case, it is much more likely that your problem is a lack of mobility in your shoulders.

Just do the test by leaning against a wall and stretching your arms upwards. You will see that it is much more difficult than it seems to have your arms in line with the rest of your body. This is why when you are in handstand you will compensate by going forward with your shoulders and then breaking the line of your handstand. You can see here a before/after work on my shoulder mobility: from [https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=118](https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=118)  to [https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=332](https://youtu.be/aioNvFafPTE?t=332) . I know that my form is still far from perfect and that I could have more open shoulders so I continue to work on it.

I can only advise you to work on your mobility as soon as possible, you will be able to work on your handstand in the best possible shape and progress more quickly towards more advanced figures such as the hollow back, the flag or even the one arm. So yes, I grant you it will surely not be the most ""fun"" part of your handstand learning, but even if you can spend 5 minutes a day to it, believe me you will see the difference!

That's about all I would have liked to know at the start of my journey, which would have saved me a lot of time... I think these are not the most common tips found in all the online tutorials. I hope this will help some and I just have to wish you good luck guys!"
I have bigger Triceps with banded pushups now compared to chest press in the past.,chinawcswing,562,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lp5gtm/i_have_bigger_triceps_with_banded_pushups_now/,1613938311.0,"Several years ago, while weightlifting I would do bench press regularly, and tried different triceps specific exercises like triceps pull downs, dips, skull crushers, etc. However, my triceps **never** got big, and I was always unsatisfied with them.

I stopped going to the gym for several years, but since Corona virus I have been using body weight fitness and resistance bands. In regards to triceps and chest, I am in particular doing pushups with resistance bands. I get the feeling that the resistance bands do more for your triceps while doing a pushup compared to your chest, because the band doesn't really get a stretch until the final half of the pushup.

Now, my triceps are the biggest they have ever been in my life. When I flex my bicep, my triceps gives the illusion that my biceps are huge just because my triceps make my arm look bigger. It's very cool. On the other hand, my chest is really not that big; I'm not that satisfied with my chest.

**My question is if this makes any sense: is there anything about a pushup that might lend itself to resulting in a larger hypertrophy of the triceps, and a smaller hypertrophy of the chest; likewise would a bench press tend to lend itself more to the chest, compared to the tricep? Or am I just some weirdo who can get big triceps from pushups but not from other exercises?**"
What fitness equipment and equipment hacks are you using for well-rounded workouts in isolation?,ABrotherAbroad,560,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fydjoa/what_fitness_equipment_and_equipment_hacks_are/,1586514989.0,"I want to start a discussion about what equipment and hacks we each use to get in a balanced (push/pull on all planes) bodyweight workout and continue to progress with limited equipment.

I’m all about bodyweight fitness and minimalism in fitness, but I’ve found that if I don’t have a pull up bar or dip bar handy (which most of us don’t at home) it can be difficult to get in a balanced workout (push/pull on all planes) at the level of resistance I strive for, so I wanted to share the gear I use and my hacks, and find out what everyone else uses.  I travel constantly so this is the gear I always keep anyways to make sure I can get in a workout anywhere.

I’ve included pictures and links to how to make/adapt/substitute most of the items in [my list on this post](https://abrotherabroad.com/essential-workout-gear-for-home-and-travel/), but I’ll give a shot to sharing as much as I can here and walk anyone through hacking gear with what they’re stuck with at home right now (one of my favorite ways to waste time).  I’m interested in the equipment and hacks everyone else is using.

Sorry in advance for the text wall.  I seem to be trapped inside with lots of time on my hands...

**My Essential Home/Travel Fitness Gear**

* **Compact suspension trainer:** I recommend making [this DIY gymnastics rings styled suspension trainer](https://abrotherabroad.com/diy-gymnastics-rings-for-the-perfect-travel/) as I swear by this thing and you can make it in 30 minutes with $30 worth of supplies, or improvise completely with a couple carabiners, paracord, and PVC pipes for handles. Its essentially a simple set of gymnastics rings (pvc pipe handles plus tubular nylon webbing and a cheap, SAR grade buckle, plus a carabiner and runner for the anchor). If you’re not comfortable sewing, look up how to tie a Figure 8 knot and use that instead of stitiching. If you can’t find the style of buckle I’ve used, look into using a clove hitch knot on a carabiner for a secure knot that allows you to easily adjust the length of the rings. To anchor, use a carabiner and a sewn loop (aka runner) wrapped around a pole or thrown over a door. Either tie a figure 8 knot in the runner and throw it over the door pulling it closed, or wrap it around a pole/tree in a girth hitch knot, clip the carabiner in, and clip your suspension trainer into the carabiner.  If you can't find webbing for the straps, try braiding strands of paracord (for a single stronger strand) and build the same design with knots instead of stitching.  -- I've found that every exercise imaginable (even a variation on levers) are possible with this thing, with a little creativity
* **Sandbell:** Similar to a heavy duty dry bag with a cushioned wrap for the handle. Doubles as a sandbag weight (for the backpack) adding weight to normal calisthenics. The particular sandbell on my list is a heavy duty dry bag with a neoprene pad that wraps around the handle, but any dry bag will work as a sandbell/kettlebell/weight as long as you’re not slamming the weights. If a drybag isn’t available, consider using a doubled up pair of pillowcases. Simply put one pillowcase in the other (for extra strength), fill with stand, roll the top as you would with a dry bag, tie the ends, and you have an easy sandbag and makeshift kettlebell. If your wife/husband/mom/gf/bf gets mad about you appropriating pillowcases, just tell them the future body is worth the sacrifice. The excuse likely won’t fly, but it may make a good quarantine story.  Either sandbell (drybag or pillowcase improvisation) makes a great weight for a backpack and adding weight to calisthenics.
* **Heavy Duty Backpack:** For weighted calisthenics and rucking. I use a GORUCK rucker because its built to handle the loads, and the handles on all sides make it functional for sandbag workouts. The Spec Ops T.H.E. pack is a great, fairly cheap alternative.
* **Speed Rope:** Easy addition for cardio and tons of cheap ones on Amazon. I honestly get extremely bored with jump roping, but it gets my heartrate up enough while staying in a single space that this is worth having.
* **Short Resistance Bands (12”):** Just an excellent and cheap piece of gear I keep in my kit that I for recreating the deadlift movement without weights. Its not bodyweight…but no one is perfect, and it’s a valuable exercise to add to the routine. Rogue Fitness offers the best short, heavy resistance exercise bands I’ve found at 12” and 140lbs resistance. For a handle, look for a large carabiner (D-Ring or O Ring). I use the Omega USA ones from REI. To anchor, either step in these, or use the anchor from the suspension trainer above
* **Long Resistance Bands (41”):** Great for stepping on or laying on to add resistance to upper body pushing and pulling movements, or create the movements if no pull up/dip bars are around. Anchor these by stepping on them, or using a runner (sewn loop) and carabiner to anchor in doorways or on trees/poles. Add the carabiner as mentioned above for a handle. Rogue Fitness is the cheapest and best option for these that I’ve found.

**Mobility Gear**

* **Foam Roller:** Focusing on foam rolling on off days, and using it as a way to avoid working out too much. If I have any pain issues, I simply go to Youtube and search “Mobility WOD + \[painful spot\]” and I can use the foam roller to fix any issues.
* **Lacrosse Ball:** A cheap, tension relieving massage that will help mobility/flexibility (research myofascial release with a lacrosse ball). I use the mobility WOD stuff for this too.

That's my kit.  Looking forward to hear what everyone else uses, ideas for good. compact fitness gear and learn some hacks."

How could I achieve more wrist strength?,MKSasu,556,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ia4jkn/how_could_i_achieve_more_wrist_strength/,1597484441.0,"I am trying to learn the rings muscle up and for that I need to get comfortable with a false grip. My problem is that when I try to do a pull-up with a false grip my hands slip (I guess I lack that kind of grip strength). Because of that, I started practicing holding my body on the rings on a false grip, but when I do I cannot move my hands from the most comfortable position (perpendicular to my shoulders) and my wrists hurt after a few seconds of hold. 

Is this normal? (It didn’t hurt so bad when I got used to grip with my fingers)

What exercises should I do to improve my wrist strength? (apart from static holds) And how often should I ""train"" wrists?

Is it better to do the false grip with or without wrist support? I normally do them with it but today I tried without my wirst wrap and felt like I had some more flexibility, but I am afraid this could lead to injuries.

I’ve been a longtime lurker on this sub, and have found it super helpful for my own personal training. 

I hope posting this is okay. It’s not for any personal gain - more for sharing it in case anyone is looking into doing the same. I know I’ve had a couple of friends reach out asking me how I built it.

Back in July, I ended up building a [calisthenics gym](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CCwgTmxjiir/?igshid=5cfs9l144iq2) based on Benjamin Uyeda’s (YouTube: HomeMadeModern) [A-Frame Pull Up Bar](https://youtu.be/YgeWd5-CFIY). 

I made some modifications on his design (with the help of my dad) in order for me to have the parallel bars installed as well. Since then, I’ve also added rings, and will be screwing it down to the deck with some brackets so I can do some muscle up training.

I hope this helps anyone thinking of doing the same thing. I’m more than happy to share how I made it too, and the differences in how I built mine compared to Ben’s.

Cheers everyone, and thanks for helping me train better."

Hey guys,

My friend's not familiar with Reddit but he's made some gains that I think you guys would appreciate, so I thought I would post for him. My friend Kelvin recently went through a fitness journey and thought you guys would appreciate it. I got his full consent to post this link and all of the following information. Some background on him: he's 5'10 and currently 23 years old. When he started his fitness journey he was around 155 pounds, then went down to about 150 pounds, then up to around 160 pounds at the end.

His philosophy was to try a more minimalistic approach to the whole fitness thing and surprisingly got results faster and more effortlessly than ever before.

Workout/diet routine: He worked out 3 times a week and his split was chest, triceps, legs and back, biceps and shoulders.

He did a hybrid training style incorporating both weight training and body weight training with reverse pyramid training on my big lifts.

He started out with easier variations but towards the end some of the exercises he did in my routine include incline bench press, one arm push ups, weighted pull ups, muscle ups...etc
For nutrition he did intermittent fasting - eating 2 meals a day. Generally one around 2-3ish and 7ish. He estimated his calories.

The video provides more details of his journey and some of the workout exercises he did.
I hope this video and story inspires you to take action and start.

All love here, everyone!"

3 months ago I started my journey towards a healthier body.
I was at the lowest point in my life, physicaly and mentally.
I was 65kg, at slightly above 180cm, skinny and no muscle at all. (29 years old)

This was me, on the 20th of march 2017
http://imgur.com/a/Iggke

This is me now, 17th of june 2017, 10kg heavier
http://imgur.com/a/BRFXE

I have been working out roughly 3-4 times a week.
Using a full body program.

3-4 cycles of:

Pushups

Plank

Lying leg raises

Bicep curls (didnt have any bars to begin with so I used weights for this, when I have a bar i do Chin ups instead)

Started out with chair dips, then transitioned into normal dips

Mountain climbers

Diamon pushups (eventually)

Assisted pistol squats

Hollow Body hold.

Pike Pushups

Weighted calf raises

Pullups (when im at the park, otherwise i do the inclined pullups with the sheet trick, Thanks Antranik)
Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rloXYB8M3vU

First week i was in so bad shape i had to do most of the pushups on my knees, I couldnt even get past the first 8 repetitions.
Now im doing 10 reps with 15kg on my back.

Ive started doing all sorts of various exercises now, I usualy change it up every week, just to keep myself entertained, so its hard to write down a specific program at this point.
But plenty of pull exercises has been added.

I now weigh 75kg, I actually hit that goal last month, but at the same time, my weight would bounce by quite a bit, I would say its pretty steady at 75-76 now, a goal I originally set for myself for christmas.
My goal was to hit 70 before summer, and then 75 before christmas. 
The most I have ever been was 71 kg during my period in the army, I probably worked out more then than I do now, but at the same time im eating alot more now.

I dont have any special diet, I eat mostly healthy foods, and lots of it, fruits, fish, chicken, oatmeal and plenty of meat. I use creatine and the occasional protein shake if im not having anything protein rich for dinner.

When I started out i tried to eat between 2500-3000 calories a day. Ive stopped counting calories but im pretty sure im at around 3000 a day now, with the occasional binge to 3500.
I make sure to drink plenty of water.

I do most of my workouts at home, but there is a calisthenics park not far from where I live, so I go there when the weather is nice, I plan to use it alot this summer.

The main reason I want to post this is because I have found so much motivation and tips from this community, and what I have learned is this stuff actually works... it works so well!
So hopefully I can motivate some of you, like many of you have motivated me.
And most of all, to show everyone that this type of workout is fun and..... literally life changing!

Diet: 
While I dont follow any particular diet I can shed some light on what I would eat on a normal day.
I would also like to mention that I highly recommend picking up a bucket of protein powder if you are just starting out, make sure you get enough protein, and if you are like me, who struggle to eat enough, it can be really nice to get that extra protein from the shake.

Breakfast: 2-3 Slices of bread with butter and ham/cheese/liverpaste/eggs

Lunch: 2 slices of bread with butter, eggs, avocado, salmon, shrimp, mayo and some dressing
then 2 more slices with jam or something simple

Dinner: I quite enjoy making food so Ill just make whatever im in the mood for.

Before bed: 1-2 Bowls of oatmeal with apple and banana

I allways snack between meals, fruits, nuts, cottage cheese.
I try to aim for 2g of protein per 1kg of mass, so if you are 70kg, aim for 140g of protein per day.
I dont know whether or not that is optimal, its just what Ive read and what ive been doing.
So whenever im not having a protein rich dinner, or i know ill probably wont hit my protein goal for the day, ill have a protein shake aswell.
Also, make sure you get enough water, i guess probably 2-3kg of the weight ive gained is water weight, I carry a waterbottle with me at all times.

Im no food nazi, and can easily pig out on a giant cheese burger with fries in the weekend, food is food.
But i do try to stay away from sweets, I have one weakness which is bake goods, and it happens where I pig out on that aswell, but 9/10 when I want something sweet, ill grab some fruits or cottage cheese instead.

So thanks everyone, keep working hard!

edit: Feel free to message me aswell, if there is anything you want to know. Ill gladly share my tips and what Ive done, but remember that im just 3 months into this, so while I can say that what Ive been doing has worked for me, it might be far from whats actually optimal. There are probably people with 100 times more knowledge about exercising than me, on this subreddit alone."

But some months ago like you see in the picture, many times i didnt went to the gym and my eating habits were like shit (my parents are both fat, not obese, but eat tons of crap) In january 2017 i move in to my own department to study for college (architecture). Since then i took advantage of this huge change in my life and decided to try bodiweight fitness.

I have been using the begginer's routine and added some other exercises on this site. 

The workout i did, and i do is an entire body workout that lasts exactly 1 hour 30 mins. Ex: I train on monday's, rest on tuesdays, train on wendsday, rest on thursday, train on friday, rest on saturday, train on sunday, rest on monday, and so on. If i dont feel like training one day for ""x"" reasons i just train the following day.

Believe it or not this really helped me develop to another level my routine.

Im not done yet. I plan on keeping this training for some months and will post more updates. Remember most of the muscle i have on the after pic was helped by the training i had before. In 4 months i couldnt have made such magical progress. My weight in the before pic is 66 kg and after around 68kg.

From 4 to 8 pullups...out of the blue,Ganceany,558,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jd6hvt/from_4_to_8_pullupsout_of_the_blue/,1602981009.0,"Hello bwf, I started doing bw training about 7 month ago, I was severely overweight, probably just getting into the obesity range. Lost about 40 pounds and now I gained 5 pounds because I took care of my grandma for a few weeks (and we all know grandmas cook a lot and want you to eat).

I used to have an issue with pullups, I felt a nerve in my right arm moving and it did hurt a bit. But during that time with grandma I found out the issue was that I had my elbows pointing foward. So I went through a ""relearn"" face of the pullup. Where I did them slow and controlled. 

Now its been about 2 weeks, im on weightloss again and havent lost much (about 2 pounds more or less) still got a long way to go. (Im about 20% bodyfat i believe).

I could only do about 4 pullups max. (Im proud of it because I coudnt even do one at the begining.) And out of the blue. Today I could do 8 Fairly easy.

What the hell its going on?. I didn't expect that at all. I was doing rep after rep expecting the failure yet no. I did 8 but I felt a few more in the tank, yet I was losing form and I didnt want that.

Why switching up your exercises a lot is a bad idea,eshlow,557,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4oddzi/why_switching_up_your_exercises_a_lot_is_a_bad/,1466084863.0,"I realized the FAQ doesn't really explain this concept in depth, and there are a lot of new people on this subreddit. Thus, I figured I would introduce one of the basic concepts on why training is highly systematic.

-----

You may have heard the term ""muscle confusion"" where you constantly switch up your exercises to confuse the muscle so that you get bigger and stronger. It's BS marketing. Ignore it.

The reason why there is **one** recommended routine as opposed to a split or infinite variation such as crossfit is intentional and important. And if you look at most competitive CFers they rarely do random workouts anyway. There is a scheduled and systematic method to the madness. That reason is based on the strength equation.

* **Strength = neural adaptations * cross sectional area of muscle**

Let me explain this equation.

1. Cross sectional area of muscle is simple: muscle hypertrophy
2. Neural adaptations include factors such as rate coding (firing rate of muscles), muscle recruitment, muscle synchronization (intra-muscular coordination), contribution (inter-muscular coordination), antagonist inhibition, motor learning

-----

Some of these neural adaptations are **non-specific**. That is they apply broadly. For example, doing dips will give you the strength to do pushups because the body learns how to recruit and synchronize muscle fibers as well as increase the firing rate.

However, some of these neural adaptations are **specific**. For example, contribution and motor learning. You may have heard the term that ""strength is a skill"" before. That is true. The more you practice an exercise the better you will get at it in both quality of movement and strength. 

For instance, if you can bodyweight squat 10 times a in row your weighted back squat may be mediocre. But if you can bodyweight squat 100 times in a row while your weighted back squat may not be as good as if you did weighted back squats, but you would definitely be able to weighted back squat more than someone who can only do 10 reps of bodyweight. A personal example is myself. I never thought about trying weighted dips until I could do 30 dips in a row. Once I did weighted dips, I could do 90 pounds for 5 reps.

-----

Now that we understand the basic concepts, why do we do the same exercises over and over?

I explained it in terms of strength being specific. Thus, training a specific movement over and over allows you to improve at it significantly. When you systematically improve on one particular exercise this is called **progressive overload**. Progressive overload does not simply have benefits for strength but also hypertrophy. 

If you go to any gym or watch people workout, you'll notice that the people who are the strongest are usually also the biggest. This is no surprise given the strength equation. Hence, the way you train both at once is through progressive overload principles. You are improving on specific strength by doing an exercise frequently (specific factors), AND you are improve on strength and hypertrophy by increase the intensity by moving up in progressions, reps, and/or volume (non-specific factors and progressively overloading the muscles).

Therefore, if your goals are strength and hypertrophy, switching up your exercises often is a bad idea. Stick with the same exercises and progressive overload. This is why most beginner full body routines have all of the same or similar exercises. They are the best bang for your buck to progressively overload. This is why training is typically very highly systematic and planned.

The end.

**edit**: since there has been some confusion, this post is mainly meant for **beginners** to be used in **full body routines**. If you're past the beginner stage and/or using a split there is more room for isolation work and changing exercises around to hit specific weaknesses.

Day 14 (Today!)

Hey folks! If you've made it this far, congratulations! You've just done 2 absolutely jam packed weeks and hopefully learned a lot about some fundamental exercises and theory about training!

This is your second rest day this week, so today we'll be doing:

\- Nothing,

\- Some more nothing!

# Today's Learning: Nothing. You've earned a break!

Simply bask in your achievement.

Or, If you missed anything this week reading-wise, today would be the day to go back and read (or re-read!) that.

# Workout #14:

&#x200B;

Rest Day.

&#x200B;

# Final Remarks, and What to Do Moving Forward

So now that you've completed the 'Build-Up' phase of the Primer routine, you can move on to the normal, full capacity BWF primer.

This means now you are going to be only training 3x per week, but you'll be doing 3 sets of every exercise instead of 2, and you're finally going to start progressing to harder exercises once you reach the top rep range of an exercise!

For Clarity, this means your training days will look like this:

|Exercise|Sets/Reps|Rest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[Birddog Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/bird-dog)|3x6-10 reps each side (or 3x10-20s for Static holds)|60-90s|
|[Deadbug Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/deadbug/)|3x6-10 reps each side (or 3x10-20s for Static holds)|60-90s|
|[Push-up Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/push-up/)|3x5-12|60-90s|
|[Rows](https://www.nick-e.com/row/) (Or [Reverse Push-ups](https://www.nick-e.com/reverse-push-ups)) Progression|3x5-12|60-90s|
|[Squat Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/squat/)|3x8-15|60-90s|
|[Glute Bridge Progression](https://www.nick-e.com/glutebridge/)|3x8-15|60-90s|

With the rep ranges (e.g. 3x5-12) meaning you start your first session with the first number (e.g. 5 reps) and every session you will try to increase that by one rep (or 2-3s), until you get to the second number (e.g. 12) at which point you will move up in progression to a harder exercise, and start back at 5 reps again!

This will be performed 3x a week rather than 6x a week, so if you want examples of what schedule that may look like, go back and look at [Day 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ksiox7/bwf_primer_buildup_community_event_day_7/) when we covered this very topic!

Has the penny dropped for my pull-up technique?,None,547,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bwnofw/has_the_penny_dropped_for_my_pullup_technique/,1559648218.0,"Hi,

I've been trying to get good at pull-ups for years, without much success. Over the last couple of days I think I've found out why, made adjustments, noticed an instant improvement and wanted to share in case it helps, or if I'm still doing it wrong...
I know what I'm going to write has been mentioned before but I guess when you see/feel it for yourself, only then do you get a real understanding. 

For years I've never really hit more than 7-8 pull-ups, dropping off in a heap at the end of the set, utterly exhausted and feeling like my arms were going to snap at the elbow.

While I know pull-ups are primarily a back exercise, it dawned on me that I just haven't been recruiting the back muscles enough, if at all.
Even though I was retracting the scapulae and lats, I was still using my arms too much to 'pull' up to the bar.

Yesterday I tried a different approach - instead of focusing on my arms pulling me up, conversely I let my arms almost go limp, just allowing enough tension to sustain the grip on the bar. I then kept my core tight, and tried to think of my back propelling my body towards the bar, causing the arms to bend. Almost as if the bar is pulling me, not the other way round, if that makes sense. 

I felt an instant change in smoothness, lack of pain, fatigue and overall just a general feeling of hitting good reps.
Instead of, at a stretch, 7 painful, swinging, uneven and fast reps, I've repetitively managed 7 slow, controlled, smooth reps for multiple sets today. It feels like there are more reps in the tank but I don't want to overdo it.

I'm going to see if I can get 10 reps in the next few days. (UPDATE 6th June - managed 10, 10, 10, 9 at different times today!) 

Anyone else experience this sort of change in feeling? 

Cheers"
Can we talk about pull ups?,SirVanyel,548,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/16ig4v8/can_we_talk_about_pull_ups/,1694691598.0,"I'm seeing a fair few posts regarding pull ups, as if they're an exercise you can make constant, linear progression on, like push ups. The thing is that pull ups are actually really tough.

Seriously, it can't be overstated that strict pull ups (from lock out to chin above the bar), are difficult. And that's not including the variations like hollow hold which are even more difficult. You have to work real hard to get good at pull ups, because pull ups themselves are real hard. You're literally defying gravity using inferior limbs.

Go a little easier on yourselves folks. Even doing 1 strict pull up sets you above the average. Doing 5, or 10? That's huge."
Not able to sleep more than 6 hours 30 mins when doing intense work outs on a regular basis,Stitches_littlepuffy,544,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mfnp1j/not_able_to_sleep_more_than_6_hours_30_mins_when/,1617018222.0,"I used to be able to sleep at least 7 hours 30 to 8 hours 30 mins every night when i was doing light weightlifting three times a week. But from around January, I started doing much more intense workouts which involve lifting heavy weights with 1 minute rest intervals (before I used to take anywhere from 3 to 7 min rests between each interval and the weights were lighter ofc) and doing HIIT and jogging 2-3 times a week on top of that. 

Then, I started getting sleep problems. I would sleep at 12:30 to 1 am every night but would wake up after 4 hours 30 - 6 hours 30 mins of sleep (too little for me). I tried to find out what was causing this on the internet and literally did most of the things that were recommended but to no avail. Exercise was one of the recommended things so I never even considered it as being the cause and in fact I upped my workout intensity, thinking it would help me sleep better. 

After several weeks of this life style i became very depressed and fatigued and I was mentally and physically at my breaking point. I could barely study and literally felt like I didn’t have enough energy to even live. Then, a couple days ago, I read an article which said marathon runners can get this problem from overtraining so I decided to stop working out and see how things went. On the day I stopped working out (I only did light stretches that day), I managed to sleep 8 hours for the first time in months and felt pretty good the next day. The following day, I just went for a 40 min walk and I  managed to sleep for 9 marvellous hours. When I got out of bed I felt sooo freaking good. The best I had felt in a really long time. I had so much energy and even just doing chores felt fun. I felt like I could do anything and even my friends were commenting on how much energy I had. But then I decided to do an intense workout session because i was feeling so good and lo and behold I only got 5 hours of sleep last night and feel like shit. I'm going to take a break from working out today as well and just do stretches and see how that goes but if anyone else has this problem I strongly recommend you take a break from heavy exercise for even just a day or two and see whether your sleep improves. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; I think my sleep got fucked from overtraining. I will stop working out again for a day and see if I can fix it."
Science and Push-ups,nunped,545,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aindcp/science_and_pushups/,1548167500.0,"## The science of Push-ups

This is not a comprehensive review of all the scientific literature about push-ups. It’s a compilation of recent articles and some others that I found interesting or that would be good for discussion. 

Feel free to ask for more details!

###TL;DR (edit 2)

* close push-ups use more triceps and pecs

* fast push-ups and close push-ups are more stressful for your elbows

* close fists are less stressful for your wrists

* energy drinks pre-workout don't increase push-up max reps

* push-ups activate the same muscles as bench press, but with my core activation, and induce similar hipertrophy (with bench press at ~~40% of BW~~ 40% of 1 RM)

* it's possible but rare to get injured doing push-ups



### Technique
[Kim et al, 2016]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792988/) assessed the difference of muscle activation using distinct palmar widths and concluded:
> Pectoralis minor, triceps brachii, and infraspinatus muscle activities were greater during push-ups performed with the 50% palmar width compared with the other palmar widths. Pectoralis major muscle activity was greater during push-ups performed with the 50% and 100% palmar widths compared with the 150% palmar width. Serratus anterior muscle activity was greater during push-ups performed with the 150% palmar width compared with the other palmar widths.

A great review by [Dhahbi et al, 2018]( https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14763141.2018.1512149?journalCode=rspb20) follows. They searched the literature to review all previous research on kinetic analysis of push-ups. They included 26 studies in their analysis. These are the conclusions:

* The force supported by the elbows flexed is significantly greater (8–20% BW) than that with the elbows extended. 

* The load supported by one limb ranged from 6% BW for prayer push-ups to 60% BW for one-arm push-ups.

* The clap push-up imposed the highest Peak Force.

* Fast push-ups and push-ups with the shoulder adducted (e.g., diamond push-ups) resulted in the highest peak elbow flexion moments.

* Suspended push-ups resulted in the highest vertebral-joint compressive forces, which can be relevant in people with previous lower back injuries.

* Except for suspended push-up variations, the lateral and medial elbow-joint force, the peak force and rate of impact force are greater on the **dominant limb** than on the non-dominant limb.

* The push-ups with less wrist and elbow-joint stress are the ones that adopt a neutral hand position (i.e., closed fists).


[Hinshaw et al, 2018]( https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=28426510) designed an interesting study to evaluate the effect of weighted plyometric push-ups on force and power. Their conclusion:
> Because peak power is produced by different combination of force and velocity, push-ups without external loading may be more beneficial when a quick movement speed is desirable, and push-ups with external loading may be more beneficial when a greater force production is required.

### Comparison with bench-press
[Kikuchi et al, 2017]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5812864/) found that push-up training induced similar increases in muscle thickness of the triceps and pectoralis major to the 40% 1RM bench press. Similar strength gains were also observed in both groups. 

[Gottschall et al, 2018](https://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/jab.2017-0063) compared different muscles activation on bench-press and push-ups and concluded:
> the common difference between closed versus open chain exercises for all three hand positions was the 50% greater activity in the anterior core muscles during push-ups. Thus, closed chain exercises may be preferred for functional training.
> While a push-up requires more activation of the core, it is not as easy to increase the activation of the primary muscle groups during this body weight exercise. Stated simply, the intensity and muscle activity during a push-up is limited by body weight as well as anthropometry. 

They also compared knee with toe push-ups, concluding:
> the ratio of activity for each individual muscle as a percentage of total activity for the exercise was not statistically different between the toe and knee push-ups. (…) Thus, knee push-ups are an effective substitute for individuals who cannot successfully or safely complete a toe push-up, and can be incorporated in these scenarios.

### Energy drinks?

[Magrini et al, 2016]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5154715/) showed no improvement in number of push-ups with the use of a pre-workout beverage (Redline) when compared with placebo, however both groups successfully increase number of reps.

### Safety

There are some case reports of injuries correlated with push-ups:

[Meena et al, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3961944/) report an ulnar fracture (forearm) in a 24-year-old cricketer that used to do daily push ups for about one hour in the morning and evening.

[Hassan et al, 2011](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10\)60677-0/fulltext) report an intraocular hemorrage (Valsalva retinopathy) in a 18-year-old man after a few rounds of push-ups.

[Keah et al, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4170373/) reported a rhabdomyolisis case on a 33 year old, sedentary woman, that during a company motivation course was instructed by the speaker to do 90 push-ups as a penalty for losing in one of the events.

[De la Fuente et al 2008](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735-6757(07\)00464-0) report a bilateral shoulder dislocation after a session of 100 push-ups.

I haven't worked out before in my entire life so I'm very weak and lack in strength, a lot.

Because of how unfit I am I find it really hard to keep myself motivated to workout. I get tired so easily. I don't know if I'm doing things correctly or if I even have proper form. There are days that I just want to give up. These stacked up feelings make me become lazy and I start to do everything half heartedly.

I was just wondering for those who workout consistently... What keeps you motivated to keep going? When you first started and knew nothing about fitness what did you start with? Was there anything in particular that pushed you to keep doing fitness? And how has fitness changed you for the better personally?

I'm only in high school (17), so I don't really know much. I became curious about fitness when I discovered this subreddit and now I really want to change.

Thanks for reading, I appreciate any type of comments so feel free to boast about yourself or about your fitness journey even! :)

Edit:

Hello everyone, when I woke up I never expected to have this much engagement on a post. I'm really grateful for those who commented, even if it was a short message.

Thank you for all the kind words and advice, I never expected to hear from so many people. I want to feel happier with my life so I'm really trying my hardest to change physically and mentally. I'm extremely underweight and weak, so my journey is starting off very slowly. I hope I can change since so many people took time out of their day to response to this post.

I try to read every comment, so even if I don't reply to a post please know that I've read it! All your stories are so interesting, no post is less interesting than another. I've read so many comments from a lot of different people. Everyone has different reasons to start fitness and I think that every reason that I've read has been special and unique. Thank you for sharing your stories even if they are a little personal, I hope you all continue to live a healthy life!

I know motivation can't be the main reason to start fitness, discipline is something I will work on. After reading so many kind comments I'm determined to work out more consistently. I'm still young and I don't want to regret not changing at an early age, I want to life a healthy life when I'm older, living life to the fullest.

This subreddit has inspired me a lot and I want to change just like everyone here, even if it takes longer than I expect. Anyone who changes to better themselves will always have my respect, you are a role model to those who want to change.

On day one it took me twenty six minutes to finish all 161 pushups, doing sets of 20 and doing another set when I felt rested enough. (Failure or very near failure on last few sets) My max pushups in one go was 40. On the last day, however, it only took me nine minutes and felt way easier. After resting for a few days, I tested my pushup max and I did 66 pushups. 26 more in just one month. I also noticed a huge improvement on one arm pushup and planche progress.

Basically the pushup challenge works insanely well and you should definitely give it a try. I'll try 100 pullups per day next and see how it goes."

I am 5'5 and currently weight 65 kg. My bent over row is 80kg, and I am adding an extra 15KG to do weighed chins (underhand grip).

The problem I am having is that I want to do wide grip overhand pull ups. However, I just cannot get past a certain part of the motion and wondered if anybody could tell me what I might be doing wrong. I struggle going from the active hang to the next portion. If I use a stool for assistance at the very lowest part of the exercise, I can complete it from about the 20% point. If I dont go all the way down to the bottom of the exercise (full arm extention) then I have no problem getting back up. Obviously I have no problems doing weighted chins, but feel as though (through a specific portion of the ROM) I don't have enough strength to do a pull up, which seems absurd to me...

I don't know if I have worded this very well, but if anybody can understand what I am trying to ask, and can help me, I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance guys...

  
\*\*\*\*EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everybody for the helpful advice that you have given me in this thread. Also thank you for all the positivity regarding the changes I am making in my life. The guy who said it can't have been easy gets the award for the understatement of the thread haha. But no matter how hard it's been, and how hard it's likely to get in the future, life is never going to be as hard as it was as an addict. Also, Slightly off-topic, and I'd be surprised if it actually applies to anybody who's likely to read this, BUT if anybody is in a similar position to where I was last year, and needs some helpful advice or motivation regarding recovery from addiction, feel free to drop me a message.

Why you can't do a handstand yet...,MovementTom,549,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5pj24w/why_you_cant_do_a_handstand_yet/,1485113820.0,"**Watch the video: https://youtu.be/S1Mj7BuSrN4**

Hello BWF people,

Wanted to raise a really important mistake (in my opinion) that I see many people doing when training the handstand and also something not explicitly mentioned in the FAQ/RR. This mistake is using the wall assisted handstand as your ONLY handstand training.

Wall assisted handstands get you good at holding a handstand against a wall. However, they lack one of the most important elements of the handstand, **how you get inverted**.  3 sets of 60s against a wall don't teach this. So here are some tips:

* Tip 1 - Spend 5-15 minutes, 3+ times a week (even daily) just attempting the freestanding handstand. Obviously, you want to be comfortable inverting and be confident with bailing but otherwise have fun. Focused and aware attempts at balancing a handstand whilst being critical of each attempt. **Learn from your attempts**, its the point.

* Tip 2 - When doing these attempts try to avoid the gymnastic's lunge. This is sacrilege in the gymnastics world but in reality it just makes the whole process harder. This lunge is taught to provide power to transfer into round off/handsprings etc but not for balancing. Catching and balancing from a lunge is much harder. Placing the hands closer to your feet and ""falling"" into handstand makes it easier to stack shoulders and balance the handstand, see the video for a more visual explanation.

All of this is just my opinion from teaching myself and clients to handstand. What do you think?

Sorry if this was a little ""ranty"" but I feel this needed to be mentioned.

Much love,

Tom

"Deltoid Training with Calisthenics: A Guide For The Anterior, Lateral, and Posterior Delts",Prowland12,543,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10o294i/deltoid_training_with_calisthenics_a_guide_for/,1674978499.0,"**Introduction**

Healthy and balanced shoulders are essential to continued progress in upper body training, and I often observe these muscle groups not being properly developed and isolated in most trainees. Regardless of whether your goals are for performance or aesthetics, a small amount of time dedicated to shoulder isolation work can have great benefits for injury prevention.

Many ideas from this guide are based on the work of Dr. Mike Israetel. Here are the links for context.

[https://rpstrength.com/front-delt-training-tips-hypertrophy/](https://rpstrength.com/front-delt-training-tips-hypertrophy/)

[https://rpstrength.com/expert-advice/side-delt-size-training-tips](https://rpstrength.com/expert-advice/side-delt-size-training-tips)

[https://rpstrength.com/expert-advice/rear-delt-size-training-tips](https://rpstrength.com/expert-advice/rear-delt-size-training-tips)

First, I should address a few common misconceptions.

* **Compound Exercises Alone Are Sufficient To Maximize Deltoid Growth**
   * Compound exercises are essential, but they do not give your lateral and posterior deltoids the stimulus needed to stay balanced. Many trainees have anterior deltoids that are far outpacing the development of their lateral/posterior delts. These muscles are built for endurance and constant use. Fatiguing them with enough volume from compounds alone is impractical, as they tend to respond best to higher rep ranges (10-30 reps)
* **You Cannot Easily Isolate Lateral/Rear Delts With Calisthenics**
   * Certainly not true, it just takes the right selection of exercises and (ideally) a pair of gymnastics rings. The free movement of the rings is able to emulate the movement of machines such as cables in the gym. Thankfully, the deltoid muscles are relatively small and weak, and can be trained for high reps with sub-maximal loads. With good training principles you can get comparable results to training with free weights.
   * **NOTE:** Almost all of the ring exercises presented can also be replicated with just an anchored resistance band. I have also included some non-ring variations

A few pointers for deltoid training

* **Strict Form:** Avoid the use of momentum or form cheating and you'll be able to get away with very light loads, use full ROM and leverage to your advantage.
* **Volume Over Intensity:** These are **isolation** movements, focus on training them with volume rather than a high intensity.
   * The average person can recover from lateral and rear delt isolation work 2-5 days a week, with 2 exercises per workouts of 3-4x5-30 reps.
   * However,  your anterior delts can't recover quite as easily from volume as your lateral and posterior deltoids, so use a lower number of reps and sets. Remember they are already being worked quite hard from dips, pushups, and hspu/pike presses.
* **Variety:** Alternate variations occasionally to avoid localized wear and tear. Use more than one exercise per training cycle.
* **Intensification Techniques:** Refer to the Renaissance Periodization articles above to make the most of these exercises and get a better training stimulus.
* **Leverage/Shoulder Structure:** I have found that different deltoid exercises can be very effective or ineffective based on an individual's shoulder structure. If an exercise is uncomfortable for you when done with correct form, and you can't explain the discomfort from an injury or lack of mobility, it may just not fit your anatomy very well. Experiment with other exercises until you find what you like. Individuals with longer wingspans and/or heavier arms may find some of these exercises more challenging.

**Anterior Deltoid Exercises**

Anterior Deltoid exercises should involve raising your arm away and in front of your body, either to a 90 degree or overhead position (shoulder flexion) and back for full ROM.

* Rings Pallof Press
   * A mix of core stabilization with some shoulder stabilization.  The most challenging option and you can train it unilaterally.
   * [https://youtu.be/YSN3rqhYlKU](https://youtu.be/YSN3rqhYlKU)
* Rings Press
   * Not what you think it is, isolation for upper chest and front delts.
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/ring-press/748](https://programme.app/exercises/ring-press/748)
* Rings Front Raises (I Raises): [https://programme.app/exercises/trx-i's/1044](https://programme.app/exercises/trx-i's/1044)
   * I Raises replicate the front raise anterior deltoid exercise with dumbells. Comfortable on the shoulders and don't have much impact on pressing or pulling work. Superset with Y, T and W raises.
   * Another Video Example: [https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidAnterior/STFrontRaise](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidAnterior/STFrontRaise)
* TRX Alligators
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/trx-aligators/1023](https://programme.app/exercises/trx-aligators/1023)
   * A unilateral variation of the I raise. Can be used as a secondary exercise.
* Suspended Hyperextension
   * [https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/STHyperextension](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/STHyperextension)
   * A hyperextension variation with a shoulder movement at the top similar to an I Raise. I prefer these as it is more time under tension.
* Plank Walkouts & Bear Crawls
   * Non-rings options, recommended to superset with T Press up for lateral delts and Side Kickthrough for rear delts. Perform slowly for high reps to fatigue shoulders.
   * [https://youtu.be/Nbg-aizDWnQ](https://youtu.be/Nbg-aizDWnQ)
   * [https://youtu.be/f9mA-V-PIDE](https://youtu.be/f9mA-V-PIDE)

**Lateral Deltoid Exercises**

Lateral Deltoid exercises should involve raising your arm away from your body in a lateral direction (shoulder abduction).

* Rings Lateral Rollout:
   * [https://youtu.be/xEowx2f7zfw](https://youtu.be/xEowx2f7zfw)
   * For obvious reasons they are likely the most challenging lateral delt exercise option. **Practice with caution.**
* Rings Y Raises
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/ring-y-raises/765](https://programme.app/exercises/ring-y-raises/765)
   * My personal favorite of the lateral delt exercises, it is very easy to adjust position mid-set and you can easily do a high number of quality reps and get a great pump.
* Ring Lateral Glides:
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/ring-top-of-row-lateral-glides/761](https://programme.app/exercises/ring-top-of-row-lateral-glides/761)
   * A good unilateral exercise option for lateral deltoid training. I usually do these immediately after a set of Y Raises.
* Angled Side Bridge:
   * [**https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Obliques/BWAngledSideBridge**](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Obliques/BWAngledSideBridge)
   * Non-Rings option.  Make sure to maintain full ROM, the shorter leverage on your delts means you can put a bit more load on this exercise than some of the other options. Even if you have rings these are still challenging enough to be worthwhile.
* T Press Up
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/t-press-up/965](https://programme.app/exercises/t-press-up/965)
   * Non-rings option, do for high reps to fatigue shoulders.
   * Best as a secondary exercise after something like angle side bridges.
* Lying Lateral Raise
   * [https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidLateral/DBLyingLateralRaise](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidLateral/DBLyingLateralRaise)
   * Non-Rings Option, Superset with Standing Lateral Raise
   * Use as a secondary exercise or finisher for high reps. Do not need a weight if you're doing multiple sets of 15-30 reps.
* Standing Lateral Raise
   * Non-Rings Option, Superset with Lying Lateral Raise
   * Use as a secondary exercise or finisher for high reps. Do not need a weight if you're doing multiple sets of 15-30 reps.

**Posterior Deltoid Exercises**

Posterior Deltoid exercises should involve moving your arm away from yourself and backward (shoulder extension).  I have also included some exercises for scapular retraction and depression.

* Rings Face Pull:
   * [https://youtu.be/P5nqOB5oq0I](https://youtu.be/P5nqOB5oq0I)
   * This exercise seems to be one people either respond very well to, or hate. I personally find it's a solid exercise, but more challenging than any other rear delt variation, and it can be easy to cheat if not careful.
* Rear Delt Row:
   * [https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidPosterior/STRearDeltRow](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidPosterior/STRearDeltRow)
   * Keep arms at 90 degrees to emphasize rear delts, you should not feel much in your lats. Able to load this a bit heavier than other rear delt variations.
* Ring T Raises (Rear Delt Flies)
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/ring-t-raises/759](https://programme.app/exercises/ring-t-raises/759)
   * Similar to the Y raises, these are great for high rep sets.
* Power Pull/Ring Row w/ Rotation
   * [https://exrx.net/Lists/ExList/BackWt](https://exrx.net/Lists/ExList/BackWt)
   * There is some back involvement in this exercise, but it is unilateral and not intense enough to interfere with much of your pulling work.
   * Other demonstration: [https://programme.app/exercises/single-arm-ring-row-with-rotation/857](https://programme.app/exercises/single-arm-ring-row-with-rotation/857)
* Rings W Raise or Shoulder External Rotation
   * Train external rotation
   * [https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/STShoulderExternalRotation](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Infraspinatus/STShoulderExternalRotation)
* Ring Scapula Rotations:
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/hanging-ring-row-scapular-rotations/427](https://programme.app/exercises/hanging-ring-row-scapular-rotations/427)

* Ring Scapula Pullup
   * [https://programme.app/exercises/ring-scap-pull-up/756](https://programme.app/exercises/ring-scap-pull-up/756)
   * Scapula depression exercise, can also be done on a bar.
* Suspended Pullthrough
   * [https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/STPullThrough](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/STPullThrough)
   * Focus on the shoulder extension position and hold for time.
* Suspended Twist
   * [https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Obliques/STTwist](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Obliques/STTwist)
   * A twist with some shoulder involvement.

The problem is I haven't seen any progress really and I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong.

I can manage about 4 chinups. Now those 4 chinups feel stronger but I still can't get past that number. I've read some posts about making sure I activate my back and shoulders while I'm doing the exercise but I have no idea what that even means.

Forgive me for being a complete noob but can someone explain to me what it means to activate these muscles while I'm doing the exercise?

Should I be focusing on that muscle? Like trying to shift my weight on to it? Or should I keep it contracted while I perform the exercise? Ir should i be attempting to isolate the muscle and perform the exercise using only those muscles? I'm not even sure if I'm capable of doing that but I'm just trying to figure out what that means.

Thank you for any advice and tips you can give me.

COMPLETE MUSCLE UP TUTORIAL,ilmattoh,543,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/f4tcqo/complete_muscle_up_tutorial/,1581872212.0,"**Complete MU guide pt.1**  

Hello redditors! Since the last post I did received a lot of appreciation and questions I decided to start this mini series of tutorials where I'll explain my way of training the basic exercises of calisthenics. I hope you enjoy it! 

 **Overview**  

Movement breakdown:

* Requirements
* Exercises progression
* First MU 
* Common mistakes 

**Movement breakdown**

 AKA. The king of the streetworkout exercises, the muscle up will train your last, chest, triceps and arms. It is an intermediate to advanced movement that you must be able to perform if you want to become a stronger athlete. 

This tutorial will focus on learning the muscle up in is basic form (no explosive, super high muscle up) and the proper tecniques to ensure you don't waist energy on pulling too high or too explosively, but rather being able to do many muscle ups with the proper form. 

**DISCLAIMER**: This content is to be intended as advice based on personal opinion, in no way or form it is meant to substitute the job of a real PT. 

**Requirements** 

 Muscle up is an intermediate to advanced movement, so it is ideal that you approach it after you have built proper foundations. You need to be able to easily perform pull ups, dips, push ups and handstand pushups - this last one isn't really necessary, but it ensures you have a balanced phisyque and enough strength in the shoulders. 

 There are no fixed numbers to reach because the muscle up needs specific training. Even if you are strong enough, if you don't practice it enough all you'll get is a terrible form. 

 Amongst requirements I'd like to list properly warming up your wrists, shoulders, lats and generally all the muscles of the upper torso (you're not gonna use legs, not even for kipping, amirite?!). 

**Exercises progressions** 

We are going to focus on 3 exercises that will help you get your first muscle up. They are fundamental for building your strength but, most importantly, learn to properly perform the movement with no kipping, proper rotation of the wrists and the chest on the bar (this will become clearer later as I'll explain it in detail): 

* explosive pull ups;
* MOD(ified) muscle ups; 
* Chest under bar rotations to bar dip.

 Before we proceed you'll notice I have not talked about using bands or using excessive swing (I mean the freestyle swing). I think that these ""practices"" are not necessary and I might even say detrimental to your training. There are instances where they are useful but we will not discuss them. 

**1) Explosive Pull Up:** This exercise is really important to develop the strength for pulling you higher than a normal pull up. The focus of this exercise should be to pull yourself as high as possible with your chest. The goal is to touch the bar while pulling  **vertically** and **as fast as you can** .

Contrary to common belief this exercise won't magically allow you to muscle up. What it does is teach you how to generate force fast and reinforce your back muscles. Learning how to properly curl on the bar or how to pull yourself in the correct position will be the focus of the other exercises. 

 You want to practice this with fewer sets but high quality; something like 5 sets with 1 up to 3 reps could be a way to start. Focus on the quality of the movement, rather than the number of sets. When this becomes easy, you can proceed to the MODified Muscle Up. 

Here is a demonstration: [https://imgur.com/a/f08L7ag](https://imgur.com/a/f08L7ag)

**2) MOD(ified) Muscle Up:** This exercise will be the gateaway to the first muscle up. The idea behind it is to progressively learn to curl and pull yourself over the bar, reducing swing as you get stronger, until you can do a proper muscle up. Doing this will avoid you do mistakes such as kipping, chicken winging or use a wrong trajectory of pulling.

The exercise consists in pulling yourself up and towards the bar using a swinging motion and trying, in the last portiong of the movement, to curl over it (without doing the dip). Key elements are **forearms perpendicular to the bar** , no kipping, not using too much swing and the final curling motion.

The first times you try you will only be able to reach the bar with your chest. This is fine, as you will progressively become stronger and be able to reach the bar higher (even as high as your waist!). What I want you to focus on is the forearms and the curling motion.

To train the MOD Muscle Up, you want to focus on quality: 6 sets of 1-2 reps will be good for starting and ,as you get stronger, you should try to swing a bit less rather than adding reps. 

Here is a demonstration : [https://imgur.com/a/0h1aaR1](https://imgur.com/a/0h1aaR1)

**3) Chest under bar rotations to bar dip:** This is more an accessory exercise, but will be good especially if you struggle with the transition. You can practice these on a parallel bar and really focus on pulling yourself towards and over the bar. Doing these will contribute to help you memorize the movement an get a bit stronger on the transition.

**First MU** 

 If you followed all the previous steps, this should be easy! To be honest I expect you already sneaked a few muscle ups in your Modified Muscle Ups. 

 Just for the tutorial sake I am going to show the complete movement on a bar. Remember: we want to keep energy waste to a minimum, so no super explosive pulling! 

Here is a demonstration [https://imgur.com/a/Ms01ulq](https://imgur.com/a/Ms01ulq)

**Common mistakes**

 Last but not least, these are the common mistakes I see people doing when trying to do their first muscle up:

1. Kipping
2.  Using Bands
3. Chicken winging
4.  Pulling themselves too high and far - forgetting to pull towards and curl
5.  Pulling vertically
6. Attempting to do the muscle up without the necessary strength

Kipping and chickeng winging are self explanatory: they are a shortcut to a movement you're not ready for and an easy injury. If you find yourself kipping or chicken winging, focus more on your basic strength, the 3 key movements, and reduce the reps to focus on quality. 

Using bands is also another shortcut that won't be useful for learning muscle up - they can be used in some instances, but I don't like using them to train muscle up. This is just my opinion so you can decide on your own on this one. Just know that you won't need them if you followed the steps above properly.

 Pulling vertically is also a common mistake: you simply won't be able to curl over the bar if your trajectory is wrong. Same for the ""too explosive"" pull: while it is cool, it is not suited for beginners as you are focusing on learning the movement, and makes you stray away from the correct trajectory.

Back to the drawing board for the metabolism gurus,miner429,546,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/p3mto4/back_to_the_drawing_board_for_the_metabolism_gurus/,1628867679.0,"There is an interesting new extensive study on human metabolism that was just published in Science was discussed by Dr. John Torres today on the Today Show that found several quite surprising findings. Looking at the CO2 emissions of groups that ranged from 8 day old to 95yrs old. Birth to 1 yrs old very high rate. Age 1 to 20 it slows down by 3% per year. From 20 to 60 the rate stays the same irrespective of sex. They found in Pregnancy and Menopause it still stays the same. Then after 60yrs old it starts slowing down. They say when you in your 30's and 40's it is not the metabolism putting on the pounds it is calorie intake. Kristin Kirkpatrick registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic also was on to discuss the study and they seem to classify the results and well founded in the data and the ramifications it will have across several disciplines.

Quick reminder: stretch you stiff neck,TheAlbiF,548,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8vrvft/quick_reminder_stretch_you_stiff_neck/,1530621664.0,"**NOTE:** This is my experience and my advice to you, if you happen to have a very stiff neck (almost hurting) or cervical pain be careful with what you do and always consult a medical expert or pt before attempting any exercise.

**background**: male, 22yrs old student, never been too lazy and I have a pretty active lifestyle overral. Being a student forces me to sit in front of a pc (or sit in general) for long periods of time and as many may know, sitting is not the most beneficial of activities. I'm very predisposed to cervical pain and neck stiffness and I've coped with it for my entire life with ups and downs. Last month a combination of stress, air conditioning, bad sitting posture and handstand work (wich aggravated the condition, but  didn't generate it) got me really bad: I had severe cervical pain to the point I couldn't even sleep properly. As this condition was unbearable I went to a physiotherapist to get my neck fixed. After some specific massages my neck is now \*somewhat\* working properly, but the pt couldn't give me more advice than: ""stretch you neck and avoid air conditioning"".

And so the search began:

After some searching on the most trustworthy knowledge source in the world \*cough\* google \*cough\* I stumbled upon some decent exercises. Then, one day, I remembered that r/flexibility exist and started searching something, hoping to find better exercises. And so I found Kit Laughlin material (I already knew him from u/Antranik 's guide on handstand).

After searching for a while in Kit's YT channel I found these two routines:

1. [Lying stretches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ko2hjOo_4)
2. [Jaw and neck stretches (sitting)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtH7lQrPoxU)

Now, I'm not saying these are the ""end of all problems routines"" but since I started, these have helped me immensly, they take almost no time to do (10-12 minutes if you are  very meticulous) and loosen up your shoulders and neck like a charm.

Also u/Antranik made a video on jaw release, if someone is interested [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-c1rt4zSGY)

**Conclusion:**

Do you guys have any different experience with neck pain/cervical pain? Have you found any solution? Comment with what worked (or is still working) for you, so that everyone can benefit from it :D

This will be my 2nd post so please forgive me if I'm doing anything wrong. I would like to just share my 8 months progress with you all!

Today marks 8 months in the making. realized I was looking like jigglypuff so I decided to start working out and eating better. Started realizing that your health is very important, there are way too many things that come with being overweight.

Calisthenics is what i was mainly doing (push-ups, pull-ups, dips, handstand push ups, leg raises, ect). For cardio i would just play basket ball about 3 times a week for a couple hours.

I tried my best to eat healthy, cut down on carbs, sweets, dairy, replace sodas and juices with lots of water, and NO fast food! Dedication is all it takes and have fun while working out!

If i left anything out just ask away and ill reply back!

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE LOVE AND I HOPE I'VE INSPIRED SOME OF YOU! 

Some have been wanting to know my routine so here is what i do.
7 muscle ups, 25 dips, 10 pull ups, 25 push ups, 10 leg raises, 5 muscle ups, repeat!"
A Case against Convict Conditioning - Misinformation and Lies,None,545,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/pfnxrb/a_case_against_convict_conditioning/,1630476778.0,"This topic came out as a result of an internet disagreement I had. I here present you my arguments against the very popular trainibg book, Convict Conditioning. 

I strongly believe that this book is extremely overrated, full of wrong information and even some lies. Yet many people have a high regard for it. This is just not my ""belief"", I will try to present my arguements aa objectively as I can, linking various sources along the way. I have used headings and bullet points so it's easier to read navigate. 

I'm looking forward to some interesting discussions and that will possibly help each of us learn more, together.



I'll list a few right now from my memory. If I go through the book I'm pretty sure I'll point out many more. 


#• Extremely Low Volume

The recommended volume for beginners is extremely low. Beginners can, and should dp mlre than 2x10 per week. That is just stupid. For comparison, RR by r/bodyweightfitness has 3 days a week, 3 sets of 5-8 2 exercises for pushing and pulling (horizontal and vertical) and even that is considered very low volume and subper for beginners among many people. Yet RR is a very high volume program compared to CC.

#• Very Poor Idea of Exercise Progressions

The author has very poor idea aboit exercise progressions. I will give you two examples.

● The pull up progression step 8. He has 1/2 one arm pull ups before step 9 assisted one arm pull up. This is extremely stupid and potentially dangerous for tendons. The 1/2 OAP requres one to hold their entire body in a lockoff and do pull ups from there which one is not supposed to do after doing just uneven pull ups. These are even harder than OAP negatives. These are generally seen as the last progression before a full OAP. Yet he puts it before assisted OAP which is much easier. This is even shown in a video review of someone who did CC for 2 years straight - https://youtu.be/uqihO6GCUxU (move to 17:55). You can watch any OAP tutorial you like, or talk to people who arr very strong at it. You will never see 1/2 OAPs before assisted ones. [Here is a great tutorial by Mathew Zlat](https://youtu.be/kC-1tGzPf2I). He's the world record holder in weighted pull up and dip and has a one arm pull up with 32kg/70lbs extra weight.

● The notorious step 7 of pistol squat. That progression is probably the stupidest thing I have ever seen.  [There are multiple threads like this on several forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2akxcm/convict_conditioning_squat_progression_step_7/) (Google CC Pistol Squat Step 7 and see for yourself). The uneven squat is an useless progression. Here's why -

During a pistol squat, your body wants to fall backwards, not forwards. Keeping the feet in front of you like that doesn't help with that at all. The leg in front also don't play a good role in assisting the movement. If you want to do a type of unilateral squat with your other leg on the ground assisting, do Cossack squat (or side to side squat). 

#• Handstand Push Ups - More Wrong Progression

Handstand push ups. This one is another ""gem"". Why does one need to 2 minutes of headstand, 1 minute of crow stand and 2 minutes of wall handstand before doing any type of actual pressing? Why not simply do pike push ups and progressively elevate your leg? ""Ok it's just another way of training"".. ""there are multiple ways to skin the cat"".. no it's not. Here's why -

In a headstand you hardly need any shoulder sttength, it's more about balancing your body in the tripod crrated by your arms and head. Crow stand does require a little more activation from the shoulders but it's also miniscule. Lastly, in a wall handstand/handstand, your shoulders are not doing the main work. It's your traps and upper back elevating and stabilizing yoir scapula. So doing a bunvh of wall handstand is not going to build any shoulder strength to any reasonable level. Therefore, it's just not ""another way"" to skin the cat.

Also, I can do 10+ chest to wall HSPU, one HSPU with 20lbs added, yet I can't hold a wall handstand for 2 minutes. Goes to show their ineffectiveness. 

#• More Handstand Push Up Talks + Lies 

Let's talk about the handstand push ups some more. The one arm handstand push up.

It has been discussed to a fair extent if it is even possible or not. Not because of strength, but because of the extreme torque it creates. [TrainingPal talks about it in more details.](https://youtu.be/hYnmRO37SRQ) [Here are some very strong athletes attempting this](https://youtu.be/4DEQhjiaNL4). You can see how awkward the movement looks like plus notice how little the ROM is in most cases, and those are extremely strong and have spent years specifically training calisthenics. Many of them can do planche and maltese no problem. 

So there comes the issue. Is the author really telling people to do it 5 reps for 2 sets? Is it feasible? 

And if I'm not wrong, he mentions at one point that he (or someone else) could do them freestanding. I'm not sure if he realizes how hard balancing the one arm handstand is let alone doing push ups in that position. I would really like to see a video of that, of anyone doing a one arm handstand push up. The closest I have seen is by Sondre Berg, who did 1 finger assisted one arm handstand. And he is crazy strong in one arm handstands and handstand push ups and he's training for a long time.

#• One Arm Push Ups - Not As Good (or Hard) As People Think

One arm push ups. Well what's wrong with one arm push ups? Not much actually. The issue is that it's not the best way, or I should say it's objectively not the best way to train for pushing strength. Here are the reasons - 

The normal OAPU is not very hard to begin with. I got it for free while training other stuffs. There is not many ways to make it harder for your pushing muscles so not a lot of roomfor progression. But wait, aren't you supposed to bring your legs together to make it mlre strict and hard?

● This is a very common misconception people have. Here's the thing, when you bring your legs together, your pushing muscles (chest, shoulders, triceps) are not working any extra hard, your core is. There is no extra load, you are fighting the torque. This is great for core sttength, but is this really the most effective or optimal way to progress in your pushing strength? I don't think so.

● There is anther big problem with OAPU. Due to the torque, it's almost impossible to maintain the scapula depression throughout the movement. This is not the most comfortable for your shoulders (imaging your shoulders elevating during a bench press). If you think I'm bullshitting, here's [Dominik Sky talking about the same thing.](https://youtu.be/vk35lw6wQ80) And he is extremely strong in both calisthenics and weighted calisthenics (100kg weighted dip, 85kg+ strict press, hollow back press etc etc just look him up). 

There are far better ways to train tje horizontal push with just bodyweight. Rings and a dip bar add more options. But even with just the floor, you can do Pseudo Planche Push Ups, the progression is measurable (using a tape measure) and endless. Also tuck, advance tuck, straddle, half lay and full planche push ups will gurantee you elite sttength (in regards to calisthenics). **The difference between an one arm push up and pseudo Planche push ups is that as you progress, the load on your pushing muscles increases therefore you get stronger. It's not just your core that's fighting the torque.**

#• Legitimacy, Another Lie and Conclusion

I think it's important to question the legitimacy of the author as well. Who is Paul Wade? I don't believe that one has to be an elite athlete himself to be a good coach. But they need to have some credential right? The only thing I learned about him in the book is that he went to jail, and jail guys are strong and tough and big so you should listen to what he says. In many instances it feels like that the prison athletes are stronger than gymnasts or calisthenics athletes who have been training for their entire life to master bodyweight strength (freestanding one arm handstand push ups and similar inhumane feats with no evidence). I think he also mentions at some point he (or someone else from the prison I don't remember) went to a powerlifting competition after getting out of prison and beat powerlifters in bench press. 

This is most certainly a lie. Someone who just did a bunch of push ups and didn't practise the technique, is not simply going to beat powerliftrrs in bench press. Unless he is competing against 14 years old high schoolers. I also have some actual data to prove that this was a lie. 

Nile Wilson, the bronze medallist in 2016 Olympics, tested his max in bench press and it was around 105kg at about 65kg bodyweight. Impressive? Sure? Worthy of winning a powerlifting competition? Don't think so. And don't tell me a prison guy is more proficient in push ups and bodyweight movements than an Olympic gymnasts who has been training for 15+ years under the supervision of a coach. Another reference point. Austin Dunham, a very strong calisthenics/weighted calisthenics athlete and YouTuber who also trains with weights, did a bench press of 325lbs at around 180lbs (maybe a below). His poor technique was noticeable due to his lack of practice of the lift. That's mad impressive still, but winning competitions? 

I heard it best somewhere. Convict Conditioning looks like a marketing trick by Dragon Door to appeal to upper middle class Americans who don't know any better. Did some people get fit through it? Sure. But an untrained person would get results from doing almost anything. This does not at all prove the effectiveness or validity of CC. CC talks about amazing sttength, yet the results from it are way below standards to say the least.

A better option would be Overcoming Gravity by Steven Low (also by Dragon Door). The author has been a competitive gymnast himself and has coached many athletes in person. He takes a more scientific approach towards strength training through bodyweight and has far better exercise selection and progression that can lead to elite sttength (in regards to calisthenics). Not to mention the insane amount of free high quality YouTube vudeos available for everyone."

So first of all, this is going to be a long post, I\`ve had this in my mind for weeks now but never found the time to actually put it into words. Also I apologize for my English in advance as it\`s not my native language.

I divide this post into four sections. (1 Year Transformation, Goals, Recent Routine, Questions) So for those who are not interested in the progress / transformation but might want to help me with my questions, please step ahead to the last part.

**Transformation:**

Progress Picture: [https://i.imgur.com/DObLoy4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DObLoy4.jpg) (left - November 2018, middle – January 2020 flexed, right – January 2020 unflexed)

Current stats: 172 cm / 63,7 kg 

Due to a personal event in my life leading to depression and being at the rock bottom of my life (leading to psychotherapy and the intake of antidepressants) I needed to change something in my life, so I started training in November 2018. I bought some weights and started doing exercises like bicep curls etc. I never worked out in my whole life or did any strength building sports. I\`ve been skinny fat with no muscle at all. 

My biggest concern thought was that I didn\`t actually want to start weightlifting. I didn\`t enjoy it and I only did it for the purpose of becoming stronger. Then, by the end of December I randomly saw a calisthenics video on youtube and that was my turning point – it was exactly what I would like to do, it just fascinated me from the first moment. (At that time I\`ve never heard of calisthenics / bodyweight fitness before) I watched a lot of videos, bought paralletes and a pull up bar, a month later dip bars and started doing very basic exercises. (pushups, chin ups, dips, all with an extremely bad form) But I became very eager to progress and enjoyed it a lot, even though it was hard and I had no routine.

It was Christmas 2018 when I set a goal that I\`d like to be able to do a frogstand to handstand in 2019. Little did I know how hard that would be. 

I discovered planche videos and started training towards that in February. I tried to do a tuck planche, but there was literally no way I could hold it so I stopped trying and just did regular exercises again. My first big success was in late February / March when I could finally hold the tuck planche for a few seconds. I became very eager to progress with the tuck planche but shortly after I injured my wrists and couldn\`t try it again for over 6 weeks. I never trained my wrists again and didn\`t even have the knowledge to understand how important it is to train them. 

I shortly discovered ThenX after and used their app to have a routine I could follow. By that time I was able to do 3x10 diamond push-ups, 3x10 chin-ups or 3x6-7 pull-ups and 3x8 dips. The workouts were extremely hard in my opinion and I barely could finish them, my heart was racing, I was sweating like I\`ve never sweat before. 

In April I started my handstand work, finally realizing how much time you actually need to learn a handstand. I never expected that. 

In May I went for the Tuck Planche again, always had wrist pain but I ignored it. Of course I injured myself again, and wasn\`t able to do handstand or Tuck Planche for a few weeks again. It was until June when I actually found out (yes I know, it\`s very dumb) that I actually need to take care about my protein intake and other macros. So I slowly started to take care of that.

In August I finally found [r/bodyweightfitness](/r/bodyweightfitness) and the RR. I stopped doing the ThenX workouts and switched over to RR. It was way easier and didn’t actually demand too much strength which made me think that the RR is a bad thing. I slowly got used to it though and I found the progressions that I could barely do to finish the RR. I started enjoying it alot.

In September I injured my wrist for the third time, when I bailed out of a handstand incorrectly. That\`s when I gave up on handstands and Tuck Planche completely for a few months and did some research. Since then I do a 5 minutes wrist strengthening before every single workout. Nowadays I still have wrist pain, even though I\`ve been training my wrists so long now. Handstands are okay, but I can\`t progress in my Tuck Planche. My record was almost 30 seconds back in June / July. Now I can only hold a tuck planche for 15 seconds. The limiting factors are my wrists and I try the Tuck Planche very inconsistently. 

In November I bought rings. By that time I did weighted dips with 30lbs on parallel bars. When I got the rings I could barely even hold myself, let alone being able to do dips without weights on them.

In late November / beginning of December I actually reached my goal, the frogstand to handstand and actually holding it! I was able to do it back in July / August already but always fell over as soon as I reached the handstand position. Also in December I did my first (bad) muscle up! Even though I never really trained for it.

This is a rough time table of what I went through the last year. Of course there\`s more detail that I didn\`t go into. Here\`s an overview of my progressions throughout the last year:

Push-ups: 1x10 with bad form -> 3x12 (+45 lbs) 

Pull-ups: \~1x4 -> 3x8 (+35 lbs)

Dips: \~3x5 -> 3x10 on rings (+35 lbs)

FL progression: 0 -> 24s Advanced Tuck Front Lever

BL progression: 0 -> 10s Advanced Tuck Back Lever with bad form (I know it\`s worse than my FL but I never tried BL)

Planche progression: 0 -> 3x15s Tuck Planche (with very bad wrist pain, so I don’t do that anymore)

Handstand: 0 -> 15seconds (VERY inconsistent, I also don\`t follow a handstand routine anymore, which I will do starting this week though)

**Goals 2020:**

\- lower BWF%

\- 5-10 seconds Straddle Front Lever / One Legged Front Lever (whatever is easier)

\- 20 seconds consistent handstand hold and my first HSPU

\- 3-5 good form Kipping Muscle Ups in a row

**Recent Routine:** *(3x a week)*

*Warmup:*

\- Wrist strengthening (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hicA-ehGTyM)

\- Jumping Jacks 

\- Front Lever Raises (4x)

\- Shoulder Shrugs

*Workout:*

1st pair:

3x8 weighted pull-ups (35 lbs)

3x8 beginner shrimp squat (50lbs) (I don\`t really progress on these because my knees hurt when I use more weight and I don\`t prioritize my legs)

2nd pair:

3x10 weighted dips on rings (35 lbs)

3x8 single legged dead lift (50 lbs) (not really progressing on these either because I don\`t put priority into legs)

3rd pair:

3x Front Lever Progression (1 set One Legged Front Lever Negatives 3x, 1 set Tuck Front Lever Rows 8x + max hold, 1 set Advanced Tuck Front Lever max hold)

3x Tuck Planche Progression (at the moment mostly 3x10 PPPU)

4th pair:

3x 45s Hollow Body Hold (or 3x60s Plank)

3x10 Hyper Extensions

3x5 toes to bars and 5 knee raises

**Questions:**

1. As I still have a high body fat percentage I want to cut down to 60 kg, then start bulking up to 70kg and then cut again. I will still have a pretty high body fat percentage at 60kg but I can\`t cut too much lower as my total weight will be too low for my weight. Is that correct? Or what do you think I should do? I posted at [r/bulkorcut](/r/bulkorcut) before but didn\`t get an answer so I ask here again. What do you think my bwf% is right now? I\`d say 18%. I\`m not sure what to do with my diet. Cutting since a few weeks but very inconsistent (on weekends…)

2. Is there any way I can strengthen my wrists even more? I want to do Planche progressions so badly but it hurts too much. I follow the routine I mentioned above since 3 months but I don\`t feel like my wrists are getting much stronger.

I always use wrist protection and already try to have my hands sidewards in a Tuck Planche but that doesn\`t really help. It actually feels like they hurt even more compared to having the hands facing forward.

3. Are my goals realistic? 

4. What do you think about the routine I do? Should I change some exercises in order to reach my goals? 

5. I\`d like to put in some more volume as my progress is slowing down significantly over the last 2-3 weeks. I would want to include another pair with 3x8 Pike Pushups and 3x8 High Pull-ups. Or would the volume be too high?

6. Is my progress reasonable? I feel like I could be much further if I was more consistent the first 7 months of working out and didn\`t injure my wrist. Also I feel like other people I\`ve seen on youtube working out for a year are much stronger which kind of demotivates me.

Thanks to everyone in advance who takes the time to read through everything and having suggestions. I might have more questions that I forgot at the moment I\`m posting this but I will post these in the daily thread then.

If people are interested I might also post a video of my progressions."
"By request, I made a follow along video of my Nerd Neck/Forward Head Posture Routine. It takes 10 minutes and can be done anywhere! Let me know what you think :)",berimbolosforsatan,539,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/prb7f7/by_request_i_made_a_follow_along_video_of_my_nerd/,1632068935.0,"I posted a write up of my nerd neck/forward posture program a while ago and a bunch of you requested that I make a follow along video, so here it is!

https://youtu.be/jDnW7Bu6VpA

It requires no equipment (well, a foam roller, but I show you how to use a towel to get similar results) and takes about 10 minutes, so it's a great way of breaking up long periods of sitting!

Let me know what you think :)

#MOBILISING
##Thoracic Extension
Thoracic manipulation can provide an immediate relief to neck pain, so this is what we begin with. You will need a foam roller or trigger point peanut. You've likely seen this drill, where you place your object between each vertebrae one at a time and extend back. To get any benefits in your thoracic spine you have to make sure that it is your t-spine that is doing the movement, and not simply you extending through your lower back. To prevent this, keep those abs contracted. The movement is actually quite small. Remember to breathe and work up your entire t-spine, which should take about two minutes.

##Pec Minor stretch
The pectoralis minor is often shortened and tight in FHP and this can lead to depression of the clavicle and protraction of the shoulders — which is the opposite of retraction. This increases the demands on the upper trapezius fibres. So to give your upper trapezius a break after carrying around that big ol’ head of yours, we will perform a stretch to directly target pectoralis minor.  The pec minor lies underneath your pec major, and the important thing to note is the orientation of the muscle fibres, this will help us have the optimal angle to stretch the pec minor. We are going to do the classic doorway stretch, so we can hit both sides at the same time.  Raise your arms above shoulder height and rest your elbows against a door fram, the key is to have the upper angle of your arm @ 45 degrees because that is going to result in the best stretch for the pec minor. Lean forward through the door and relax into the stretch. Hold for two minutes.

##Scalenes & Sternocleidomastoid
The scalenes and scm are muscles that lie on the front of your neck. They are involved in flexing, twisting  and tilting your head and are often overworked in nerd neck.

To stretch your left SCM muscle to start, rotate your head away from that side, towards the right side, then gently tilt your head back, to engage and stretch your sternocleidomastoid muscle fibers. Watch the video to see in detail how this backward head tilt is done. Now a trick: do you know where the scalenes insert? They insert on the first rib, if we take this exact same stretch and manually pin the first rib down by pinning it down with our hands. It is the same movement as the scm stretch I just described, but now we are are pinning down the insertion point of the scalenes, it helps to lengthen those muscles as well. 

To stretch your scalenes  it is done in almost the same way, but if we go back to the picture, we can see that the scalenes insert on the first rib. If we do not pin the first rib down, we can not stretch the scalenes effectively. Essentially this stretch is the same, with less of a rotational component. 3x 10 each side.

#STRENGTHENING
##wall slides 
In FHP, the activity of the middle and lower fibres of your trapezius is diminished. So, we need to strengthen them.Everybody ignores the mid and lower traps. Most people would be hard pressed to name at least one middle or lower trap exercise. Classically, people view the upper trapezius fibres as the entire trapezius itself. The trapezius is actually quite a large muscle, which originates in the occipital region of your spine and inserts on the back of your collarbone, as well as your acromion process and scapular spine.

To perform the wall slide, we are going to begin leaning back against a wall with our feet about 30cm from the wall, place our hands and arms flat on the wall above your head - if you can not achieve this, move your feet further away from the wall.From here we are just mimicking the motion of a pull up, driving our elbows down towards the floor and focussing on pulling our shoulder blades down towards the floor as we get to the end range of the movement - pause at the bottom of each rep, focussing on the contraction between and below your shoulder blades.

## Superman
The trapezius is a broad muscle on your back that can be grouped into 3 functional regions: the upper fibres, the middle fibres and the lower fibres. The lower fibres of the traps are weakened, so we will address that by doing supermen. Two of the movements that the lower traps are responsible for are retraction and depression of the scapulae, which is the squeezing of your shoulder blades back and down, respectively.  To perform the superman, we are going to lie face down . As your lower traps might be quite weak due to inactivity, we will start with our arms down by our hips. We begin the movement by lifting our chest and hands off the floor externally rotating our hands and once we are at the top of the movement we squeeze our shoulder blades back and down. Over time as our strength increases, we can progressively overload the lower traps by trying the following positioning of our arms.  The W, T and the Y. 3 sets of 10.

##CHIN TUCK DEEP CERVICAL FLEXORS
Lastly, we have the deep cervical flexors which as the name suggests act to flex the cervical region of your spine as well as stabilise that region.  To activate and strengthen these  muscles, we are going to perform the chin tuck. The best way to think of this is that you're trying to give yourself a double chin, keep your gaze straight ahead and tuck your chin . The important thing is that we do no tuck our chin to our chest by simply flexing at the neck, as that won't target the deep cervical flexors. 3x10

Recently I've been trying some beginner calisthenics to see what my limits were and to my surprise I was actually able to do an L Sit.

First, a bit (a lot) about me: 17F, 5'8"", 135 lbs. At my best I was down to 125 lbs. I certainly looked better 10 lbs ago but just slim, not muscular. My stomach had no definition whatsoever even though I was a few pounds above underweight. At the time I was doing a light bodyweight workout 2-3x a week and running/walking a lot, so I'm not surprised. I vastly prefer cardio to strength training and cardio won't get me abs. Also, I have a small frame and not-so-generous proportions, so fat is more obvious on my body than many.  

I would like to change, though. I'm tired of feeling chubby when I'm at a healthy weight. I know I can get down to 125 lbs in ~8ish weeks if I put my head to it (and stop snacking). But how long does it take to stop looking like a [skelly](https://youtu.be/XTgFtxHhCQ0)? How long did it take you? People you know? How did you stay motivated for that duration?

I have pretty much stayed the same weight give or take a pound or two month to month. 

My workouts mainly have consisted of pushups, pullups, chin-ups, dips, and ab workouts. alternating the push pull days 4 days a week and finishing up with the ab workout. 

Cardio is mainly trying to get as much walking into my day. 

Diet is nothing special other than making sure I am mindful of my calories, eating a lot of vegies, and making sure I get enough protein. 

I'm sure I could do it faster but I am happy with the speed of my progress so far, I am in no rush.

I've had what I'd call a solid ring pull up and a solid ring dip for awhile, but I really struggled getting the transition between the two. 

I had a lightbulb moment about my grip that put me over the edge and allowed me to make the transition right away. My problem was I was holding my false grip too far up the near side of the rings (the side of the rings closest to my body when the inside of my hands are facing each other) as this naturally felt more comfortable for me. This severely limited the leverage I could get when trying to transition at the top of my pull up. The fix was to deliberately position my grip up the 'far side' of the ring, which gave me the leverage I needed to complete the transition. 

It really was as simple as changing this grip position to take me from flailing and not being able to get into the dip, to being able to get the muscle up everytime. Next goal for me is to be able to rep a few out in a row and to be able to do a slower movement. 

Hope this can maybe help someone, I watched several videos and don't think I ever heard anyone call or this exact tip."

My experience with implementing scapula work. Essential for beginners.,progressionoverload,540,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/83lkqq/my_experience_with_implementing_scapula_work/,1520756776.0,"I just wanted to talk about something that doesn’t come up all that often. Though most of us are aware of what a passive hang is, I wanted to give my 2 cents on how to implement it and what other exercises can be performed for healthy shoulders. Feel free to add what you do.

-----

*Passive Hanging*

The benefits of the [Passive Hang](https://youtu.be/FDSlY9lwAcM?t=7s);

* Shoulder and pectoral stretch
* Scapular and grip strengthening
* Spine decompression

Many prescribe the passive hang as an ailment to shoulder pain. There are knowledgeable advocates such as Steve Maxwell and Ido Portal but how useful is the passive hang? 

I implement it at the end of a workout for the stretch while my body is still very warm. When I lift my knees up I get an incredible pectoral stretch. It might be worth hanging daily as others have prescribed to retrieve further anecdote for how useful it is, but I believe that for shoulder health there is more that can be done. 

-----

*”Active” Scapula Exercises*

There is a more practical use for your time than simply hanging multiple times a day. You can strengthen your scapular with a variety of methods. “Active” methods include;

* [Scapula Pullup](https://youtu.be/FDSlY9lwAcM?t=1m40s)
* [Horizontal Scapula Row](https://youtu.be/FDSlY9lwAcM?t=2m9s)
* [Inverted Shrug](https://youtu.be/FDSlY9lwAcM?t=2m57s)

* [Scapula Dip](https://youtu.be/FDSlY9lwAcM?t=3m31s)
* [Scapula Pushup](https://youtu.be/FDSlY9lwAcM?t=4m3s)
* [Scapula Pike Pushup](https://youtu.be/FDSlY9lwAcM?t=4m23s)

I regularly perform these 6 different exercises to ensure my shoulders are strong enough for my training and daily activities. A shoulder capable of doing these efficiently is a strong secure shoulder. A strong secure shoulder isn’t prone to injury.

You are essentially training your shoulders to be more capable of performing under load in various positions. You do this by isolating the movement of the scapula (shoulder blades) in these exercises. The scapula is an important bone as each scapula provides a point of attachment for a number of muscles that make up the arm and shoulder. It’s also responsible for holding the shoulders in place while they are positioned forward (protracted), back (retracted), up (elevated), and down (depressed). Strength and stability in these positions is the result of implementing these exercises.

All exercises are performed with the same cues. 
Hold the core tight, keep the elbows straight and control the movement using the scapula only.

-----

*Programming*

You can perform all 6 as a circuit, pull variants on pull day and push variants on push day. You can rep them, hold them statically, or both. But what’s important is that you actually incorporate them somehow into your training to build and maintain scapular strength. It’s essential to avoid shoulder injury."
Getting in shape after extreme weakness due to sedentary childhood/adolescence,None,540,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/tfv1yf/getting_in_shape_after_extreme_weakness_due_to/,1647469961.0,"I (19M) grew up basically neglected by my parents; at around age 7 I started spending most of my time on my computer. My computer usage peaked between ages 11-15, during which I’d spend probably an average of 10 hours or more sitting in my computer chair every day. As you can imagine I was also very inactive and very overweight. What I also think was the crux of the issue is that my sitting habits at my computer desk kept me from properly developing my hip adductors, particularly my right one, to handle the weight of my body (I sat without my legs touching the ground).
I hit 235 pounds at 5’10 when I was 14, at which point I took it upon myself to lose weight—over the course of the next two years, I dropped down to a lowest weight of 175lbs. The problem with this was that, due to being so overweight from such a young age and not properly strengthening myself in the process of losing weight, my core and especially my adductors are VERY weak. I’m currently about 6’0 190lbs, but my inner core/inner right leg is so weak that I can’t bear the weight of my body down onto it. I walk around essentially sucking my body up to keep from completely letting the full force of my body onto my leg, as it’s way too weak to handle that much weight (I have very overdeveloped quads as a result of this, as my legs are basically always in extension to compensate). My right leg even rotates inward when I lay down because my adductor is too weak to handle the force of my leg against gravity as it falls away from my center.
I know the simple solution is to lose more weight, which I’m currently doing, but I’m afraid losing weight without strengthening those muscles will cause them to atrophy even more and make the problem even worse. I just physically can’t work out that section of my body. I can’t even do a bodyweight squat without feeling like I might break my leg. I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but any suggestions or pointers to where I could get better help about this are welcome.

Skin The Cat: It's Awesome and You Should be Doing It.,None,538,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/c5s4t6/skin_the_cat_its_awesome_and_you_should_be_doing/,1561567526.0,"In this post I am going to cover the exercise “Skin The Cat,” how to perform it, why you should be doing it, and how to add it to your program. I have a feeling most of r/bodyweightfitness already knows how awesome these are but a reminder doesn't hurt :)

# How To Skin The Cat:

Skin The Cat can be performed either on a pull up bar or a set of gymnastics rings. Start by grabbing the bar or rings slightly outside of shoulder width. Tuck your knees to your chest and activate your lats as if you were trying to pull the bar towards the floor, keep your arms straight the whole time. You should now be hanging upside down with your feet either between the rings or close enough to touch the bar. Keep going and allow your arms to travel behind you into shoulder extension. Once your arms are fully stretched then unfurl your body and point your feet towards the ground. This is the first half of the movement. Reverse the movement by tucking your knees back to your chest, activate your arms and shoulders, and pull yourself back through until your end in a straight arm hang.

For the more visually inclined, [here](https://youtu.be/zk78i3Nk0Mg?t=40) is a video of FitnessFAQ’s Daniel Vadnal performing the movement and it’s more advanced progression, the 360 degree pull.

# Reasons to Skin The Cat:

## Lat Strength:

The first major benefit of skin the cat is the lat strength in the straight arm position. Most lat work is done in a bent arm position such as rows and pull-ups, putting the lats under load in a new position exposes weaknesses and allows for gains exclusive to that new position.

The strength built through Skin The Cat has carryover to the front lever, even though the front lever is a static exercise. Stronger lats with straight arms means stronger front lever. Another fun bonus is improved deadlift position (if you happen to care about that). The lats work in the deadlift to keep the bar close to the body as well as stabilize the spine, both of which become easier with improved straight arm strength.

## Shoulder health:

No other exercise takes the shoulders through full flexion and extension the way that Skin The Cat does. Not only are you stretching the shoulders, chest, and biceps, during the eccentric portion of the movement but you’re then strengthening them during the concentric portion.

Skin the cat trains all the small muscles in the shoulder to work together with the lats, biceps, and chest as the body moves through space. Progressing in Skin The Cat both extends the shoulder’s range of motion and builds strength at the same time which will translate to better joint health and stability. Skin The Cat is also a great way to build the shoulder mobility and strength required for the back lever.

## Bicep health:

I came from a lifting background so you bet your ass I have tight biceps. Curls, barbell rows, and lat pulldowns did a great job at keeping my arms ever so slightly bent all the time (and unfortunately didn’t make my arms much bigger…).

Skin The Cat takes the biceps through a long range of motion. If your biceps aren’t used to being put in a fully lengthened position it is critical that you BE CAREFUL. Keep the movement controlled at all times and don’t hesitate to reduce the range of motion if you don’t feel comfortable going all the way. If something hurts, stop and try again another time. Ego lifting is for the bench press, not Skin The Cat.

Once you get comfortable with your palms facing away from your body (pronated) you can play around with facing your palms towards your body (supinated) which puts even more stress on the bicep.

## Bonus Reason: Chest

I’ll be honest, sometimes I get a little chest pump from doing this exercise. The chest is only used to reverse the motion from the bottom but it’s not nothing. No promises that Skinning The Cat will give you a big chest but it won’t hurt.

# How To Add Skin The Cat to your program:

The connective tissue and small muscle groups we are trying to develop take significantly longer to adapt than large muscle groups like the lats or chest. It is better to treat Skin The Cat as a maintenance / mobility exercise rather than something to progress at quickly since quick progress isn’t possible for the connective tissue. Don’t aim to progress workout to workout, aim to progress month to month or cycle to cycle.

Start by adding 3 sets of 3 reps to the end of your workouts for a month or so. Once 3x3 feels easy then bump it up to 3x4 or 3x5. When you are satisfied with the number of reps you can do then switch to a harder progression and drop back to 3x3. Repeat until you’re a 360 pulling god.

## Conclusion:

Skin The Cat isn’t the most flashy exercise but has potential to improve joint health, strength, flexibility, and coordination. If mobility, longevity, and stability are something you want to improve I would strongly recommend adding Skin The Cat to your program. As a bonus, Skin The Cat is a great way to build strength for front and back levers. Start easy with 3 sets of 3 and slowly work your way up. Once you’re doing more reps feel free to switch to a more difficult progression.

Like many of us I started doing home workouts during the pandemic, mostly bodyweight exercises (pushups, squats, and abs) eventually I bought some dumbbells so I was able to do other weighted exercises as well. 

Over this past summer I found a nearby park which had pull-up bars and parallel bars so I started going there a couple times a week to do pullups and dips. I've always been decently athletic and so starting out I was able to do about 8 pullups with pretty good form and about 15 dips.

By the end of the summer I had gotten up to about 13 pullups and even started doing weighted pullups with a backpack, it wasn't very comfortable but I think it did the job. Unfortunately where I live it gets brutally cold during the winter so I was forced to abandon doing pullups for a bit. That is until my apartment opened up a gym which had a pullup bar.

90 days ago I ended up building a skill based routine that focused on handstand progressions, front lever progressions, and planche progressions, with general weightlifting on the days in-between. I actually didn't train muscle ups specifically because the gym has really low ceilings and so I would hit my head if I tried. However I figured with the front lever progressions and continuing to work on my max pullups (I'm up to 19 now) that I could potentially be able to do a muscle up by the time summer rolled around.

Well today happened to be an unusually warm day, getting up to 64F so I decided I would go out to the park and give it a shot and.....I got it on my first try! I almost couldn't believe it! I even tried to keep going but my hand slipped, but I feel like I probably could have done 2 maybe 3.

I had my wife film the first attempt which you can see [here](https://streamable.com/hih0xw)

I ended up doing a [second attempt](https://streamable.com/13q4p9) which I think was a bit cleaner

I know they weren't perfect but I think once it starts getting warm again I'll be able to work on my form and hopefully get to a point where I can do 5+

Anyways just wanted to share with this community because you all have provided so many tips and advice on different routines and I don't know if I would have had the motivation to continue working on these skills if it wasn't for this community. So thank you and keep on keeping on!"
Ring Pull-ups are harder than bar pull-ups - my recent revelation,None,539,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gsqh6e/ring_pullups_are_harder_than_bar_pullups_my/,1590748310.0,"For a few months now I have been training on rings instead of bar. As I understood when I first starting working on them moves over the rings where significantly more difficult than under. I still struggled with pull-ups on them naturally due to the swinging of the ropes. 

When I first started the RR I was practising pull-ups on swing sets with thick bars and could only knock out three, the third with a real struggle. This was a serious wake up call to how little strength I had, especially in terms of pulling. My goal was to get to five which I eventually achieved through adding negatives after full reps. 

As I said the rings presented a challenge. Switching to rings four was the max in the beginning then I progressed to six which is my current number of reps for each 6.

The other day I decided to switch to the bar - a goal post - on pull-ups and to my amazement I knocked out 8 no sweat and could have gone on till failure. This was mind boggling to me as I always understand ring pull-ups and bar pull ups had the same level of difficulty. 

Only a few months before I was struggling for three on the same bar and now was doing 3 sets of 8. 

But why is it that I have difficulty with the rings and not the bar? Has anyone else had the same experience?"
How Calisthenics saved my life..,None,540,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/48hs9v/how_calisthenics_saved_my_life/,1456856158.0,"Hey everyone, today I want to share with you all how my life was saved through fitness/ calisthenics, and how thankful I am for it. Some background knowledge on myself, I'm 17 and have been training with bodyweight since august.

Three weeks ago I was on my bus to go to school, and it was a extremely cold winter day. I was sitting in the middle of the left side of bus, which was a relatively small bus, only held around 20-24 students.  It was around 35 degrees the day before, and some of the snow started to melt, but the day after a cold front came and everything refroze. The roads were extremely bad, and my bus driver was taking extreme caution. In my state, students aren't  forced to wear seat-belts on school buses, which actually saved me. 

We were on a highway that was around 60 MPH, but we were only moving around 40 MPH.  The bus started to skid on black ice, and one of the biggest rules on black ice is not to fight it directly but rather try to slowly ease out of it. Unfortunately our bus driver tried to fight it directly and the worst thing possible started to happen; our bus started to tip over on its left side. 

I swear everything slowed down at that moment, it felt like we were tipping over so slowly, and as it turned over I grabbed the side of the seat and pulled myself up as the side of seat was rotating to face upwards (due to tipping of the bus). I was able to some sort of makeshift muscle up to stop myself from being on the side of the ground that bus tipped over on, and students from right fell from the right side to left.


 We skidded on the ground for around 15 seconds, but it felt so much longer. After it was all over, I was traumatized, just as everyone else was. There were students who were conscious and trying to move around, while others completely blacked out. I made my way to the door and the Bus Driver turned to be alright, which some minor scratches and a hurt wrist. He opened the door, and I started helping students out. There were 3 emergencies exits on the bus, in which I helped students out as well. 

I remember the people being knocked out were the  toughest to carry, it felt so much heavier than carrying a person who was conscious. After around 15 minutes of pulling carrying and helping, me and the bus driver ( and some other drivers who stopped by) managed to get everyone out of the bus safely. 

Out of the 19 students on the bus, all of them had concussions, broken bones, fractures, and cuts..except for me. I know this sounds extremely crazy, but I feel like if I had never done body weight training I would never had the strength to do what I did.
I was so thankful of everything but so traumatized to speak at all, my mind was just so focused on trying to realize what just had happened, it was insane.

For privacy issues, I did not want to interviewed by the news at all, and I was so inaudible to talk it would've been embarrassing of me anyhow. 

Anyhow, I just wanted to share that story with you all, how fitness can really affect you in ways you didn't even think.

Edit: This happened around 6:20am, so it was very dark and it hard to see any black ice/ ice at all.

"The Relationship Between Max Strength & Strength Endurance, And What This Means For Max Pushups",randomcmvguy247,539,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/erhb3n/the_relationship_between_max_strength_strength/,1579544998.0,"I know it's not uncommon for this community to receive questions from military recruits regarding maximizing the number of push-ups they can do in a single set. I've been researching this concept for the past several days and seem to come across some research that contradicts conventional wisdom. I would like to get some opinions on my conclusions and where I might be wrong.

It seems there is an indisputable correlation between maximal strength (1RM on bench press typically) and the number of push-ups someone can do. The strength of this correlation is, of course, highly debated. People are generally quick to point out that these are two different movements and success on one cannot directly predict success on the other. That being said, I doubt anyone will refuse to concede that someone with a 2x bodyweight bench press can easily bust out a large number of push-ups at any time. The reason is obvious for this: despite never practicing push-ups, there is clearly a great overlap and similarity in the movements. This means that, for all intents and purposes, a single push-up for someone who benches 2x their bodyweight is sort of like a bastardized version of a single rep of barbell bench press with less than 30% of their 1RM on the bar.

This ability to tentatively predict success in individuals untrained in push-ups has led to many attempts to create a direct conversion between bench press and push-ups. Conventional wisdom says that the efforts required in a single push-up translate to somewhere between 55-65% of your body weight in a single rep of barbell bench press. It's for this reason that we can make predictions about people who have never trained push-ups. If that guy can bench press 225lbs and he weighs 225lbs, he would have no problem busting out some push-ups. On the other hand, if this gal can't even bench the bar and she weighs 160lbs, she obviously isn't doing any push-ups. Despite the clear differences in the movements (the whole-body nature of push-ups, the stabilization required in the barbell bench press) there is clearly a direct transfer between the two. Okay, that's out of the way.

If we can agree on the above, then let's move on to the relationship between muscular endurance and maximal strength. For some time now it has been widely accepted that gains in maximal strength directly translate to increased muscular endurance given a static load. This is obvious with an example: a max set of reps on barbell bench press at 225lbs, like at the NFL combine. Someone who can only bench press 265lbs for a single rep is **NEVER** going to do more reps of 225 than someone who can bench 375lbs for a single rep, no matter how much muscular endurance training they do. This can be explained intuitively: the 225lbs feels heavy for the first guy and it feels light for the second guy. The lighter a weight feels the more times we can move it.

I don't think the above is all that controversial, but here is a single study on the subject showing that even an acute max-strength training program utilizing heavy barbell bench press increased push-up endurance in BJJ practitioners by 32 +- 12%:

This is because a set of push-ups works more or less like a max set of a given weight on barbell bench. Assuming a person maintains the same body weight across time, you are basically just performing a maximum set of barbell bench-presses with X amount of weight, let's say 110lbs for a person who weighs 180lbs. The lighter you can make a barbell-bench press of 110lbs feel, the more reps you will be able to bang out despite zero movement-specific training. So our goal, prior to becoming more efficient at push-ups, should be to make a push-up feel as light as possible, right?

In response to the above question, I posit the following answer:

&#x200B;

1. Yes, the lighter a single push-up feels to you (in other words, the LOWER a single push-up is as a percentage of your 1 repetition maximum), the more you can do.
2. Therefore, our first goal should be to increase our 1-repetition maximum to a point where further gains are producing diminishing results (benching 415 rather than 405 at 185lbs bodyweight might not make any difference in max push-ups, but benching 155 rather than 145 makes a big difference & is easier to attain - more on what the ideal ""max"" might be later).
3. The most efficient way to improve maximal strength is to work in the <= 5 rep range. Higher rep ranges are less focused on strength gains and more focused on hypertrophy and/or endurance and do not provide the same increases in maximal strength.
4. Therefore, in practical application, a person will likely be doing the majority of their training to max out a set of push-ups on a barbell rather than with push-ups themselves due to the ability to easily progressively overload a barbell and monitor the exact weight on it to ensure they are working in a low enough rep range.

The logical outcome I reached above led me to research whether or not anyone has attempted to address what the magical ""maximum"" might be that a person should aim for prior to training the specific push-up movement and/or endurance. I was able to find one such study:

>As the ability to repeatedly apply submaximal force is a requirement of firefighters, and other occupations/sports, the current research suggests that the initial goal of a training program to enhance muscular endurance should be to increase maximum strength to a point that the specific load being lifted during repeated actions is less than 40% of the individuals' 1RM. Subsequent training should then focus on maintaining maximal strength levels and improving local muscular endurance in the specific task.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19620916](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19620916)

If we lend credence to their recommendation of aiming to make a specific movement 40% of your 1RM prior to movement-specific/endurance work, it would be easy to prescribe a specific training plan to someone looking to eventually max out their potential for push-ups: train heavy/lose weight until roughly 60% of your body weight is equal to 40% of your 1 rep max on bench press.

With some simple math we can solve for X and rephrase this recommendation: *aim to bench press 1.3x your bodyweight prior to training push-ups.* This recommendation clearly shows the importance of not only gaining maximal strength but also keeping your weight as low as possible at the same time. And while attaining a 1.3x bodyweight bench press might not be realistic for most people, it can be said that any efforts to get closer to that number (such as reaching 1x bodyweight bench press) will produce results for those looking to hit high reps in a max set of push-ups, the same way that working up to a 100lb barbell curl would make it a lot easier to curl 20lbs 80 times.

With all of the above in mind, a little commentary on current conventional wisdom: I think the traditional answers of ""work up to 12 push-ups on an incline, and then move down"" followed up eventually by the inevitable ""do a set of push-ups to failure, rest 30 seconds, and then start again"" are just plain bad info when it comes to developing a long-term training plan for push-up performance. Any plan that has you working in a 8+ rep range, or god forbid doing sets of 20+ to failure, is more or less trying to accomplish what I've laid out above but is doing so in a terribly inefficient manner. They are hypertrophy workouts, guaranteed to build bigger muscles but not ""stronger"" muscles. And in some cases, they are endurance workouts, which certainly have a place in a push-up routine, but probably towards the tail-end as we discussed above.

By the way, the above is in no way a criticism of people recommending doing calisthenics/bodyweight exercises for their convenience. This is purely directed at people who are making a concentrated effort to maximize their push-ups in a single set, possibly because their careers, opportunities for advancement, and even livelihood depend on it (like in the military). My main thoughts are that the ""traditional progression"" must not apply to them."

**EDIT:** i should have mentioned this earlier, but the clicking in my hips is *very* uncomfortable. it’s not something that goes away with stretching or warming up before i exercise. i’ve lived a pretty sedentary life for years up until this point, and so i’m certain that the pain is due to very tight and probably small/atrophied hip flexors."

I think this is because my glutes are too weak. But how do I strengthen them? Glute bridges? Again, my back arches. I try to tilt my pelvis posteriorly, but I can't even get off the ground like that. That's how weak my glutes are. It all creates this disconnect in my posterior chain. I can't do a sit-up or a glute bridge, it's like my upper body and lower body are separated."

I had been stuck at about 10 max pushups for a very long time (don’t laugh), and decided to try greasing the groove just to see what would happen.  I did max 4 pushups as the grease amount, repeated several times over a day.  I actually wasn’t that faithful with it, poor discipline, but still tried to do my sets here and there.

After just a couple of weeks, my max went to a pretty easy 18 pushups, so that’s super. A big jump for me!

I kind of want to continue the greasing the groove because it’s so … effortless… but since I doubled my pushups, the grease amount will be my old max!  This seems odd and potentially injuring (I’m 50 and so have to watch out for stuff like this).

Any recommendations?  I’m new to GtG and so am learning. Have searched and read up but can’t find any hints.  More experienced guidance would be appreciated.

Strength Gains:

Pullups went from 5 rep max to 3x5 First 3x5 Pullups: https://youtu.be/OxBlb16z92U

Pushups went from 3x8 diamonds to 3x5 bent arm archers, going to try 4x3 Straight arm archers today

Training Routine: My first month and a half i did beginner routine and i kept lying to myself saying the volume wasnt enough. I started doing a routine I made myself for around 2 weeks and i couldnt even complete it myself. So here i am back at the beginner routine. I didnt start consistently doing rows and dips until 3 weeks ago when i found one of those adjustable pullup bars that you twist into the door frame. I still have yet to buy rings.


Goals: 

145lbs (long term)
5s Free handstand (Next month)
3x7 Pullups (Next month) 
3x8 Archer pushups (Next Month)
Bar Muscle Up (By May 22nd)
Vsit hold 10s (Next month)
Aesthetics (long term)


Diet & Supplements

Been taking creatine the whole 3 months and didnt start using whey until last month. I would like to start taking fish oil. My breakfast on weekdays when i dont have much time before school is usually peanut butter toast or oatmeal and milk. On weekends i usually make eggs and sausage on toast. Lunch is whatever low calorie nutrition lacking meal michelle obama forces the school to feed us. Honestly prisoners are fed better. And for dinner i eat whatever my mom makes. On workout days i drink a half serving of whey 30 minutes before a workout and a full serving right after. And on rest days i drink a shake with breakfast.

I just bought mine and been playing around with them and intuitively this does make some sense to me.

The Top 3 Exercises I Learned in 2018 From The Bodyweight Warrior (Do These For Crazy Results),calisthenics_hacker,532,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/awtkat/the_top_3_exercises_i_learned_in_2018_from_the/,1551616013.0," You may have watched some youtube mobility videos from the Tom Merrick (aka the Bodyweight Warrior) as this is his most famous thing. But what had a biggest impact on me were 3 different exercises he told me to do on his training programs.

&#x200B;

To be honest, I had never seen before any of these exercises. First I thought that they were BS. But then **after doing them for at least 6 weeks I saw big results** I didn't see by just doing plain basic exercises. The results ranged from pure strength gains, new skills and increased rehab / prehab.

&#x200B;

So I'll write here some of the benefits from each of these exercises and if they match with your goals don't miss out...

# Pike Pushup Plus:  The Best Way To Unlock Free Handstand Pushups and Presses

Would you like to do freestanding handstand pushups (free HSPU) or bent arm handstand presses (BA presses)?

&#x200B;

The Pike Pushup + is the reason why today I can do these exercises. I did handstand pushups against the wall on the past but they didn't translate well for me to free HSPU or BA presses.

&#x200B;

**The Pike Pushup + will not only give you the strength but most importantly it will teach you the skill part**. Here's how:

* When you do a ""Pike Pushup +"" you do a regular pike pushup but once you hit the bottom you lift your feet for a second (at the beginning just few inches or cm is enough)
* This small difference makes the exercise much harder. So you may need to already be able to smash high reps (10+) for regular pike pushups.
* The key is that when you lift your feet you keep you **keep your shoulders forward on the bottom position** (elbows bent). This is extremely important as it's necessary on the free HSPU and BA presses.
* The progression is basically to lift your feet higher and higher (while keeping elbows bent and shoulders forward). Once you can lift yourself to the top I recommend you holding the bottom position for at least 5 seconds to create a strong base. Then Free HSPU or BA presses will unlock automatically or with the help of some eccentrics.

# Zottman Curls: Bulletproof Your Elbows

Have you ever suffered from golfer's elbows? This is very common for pulling addicts. Specially when starting to train for One Arm Chinups this starts being a big issue (most people like myself tend to start training this move too early).

So after perhaps some overtraining my elbows were not in the best condition (but fortunately it wasn't yet anything serious).

What helped me the most bring my elbows back was the Zottman Curl. Here's how:

* The Zottman Curl is like a Dumbbell Biceps Curl but at the top you pronate. So you supinate during the concentric phase, at the top you pronate, during the eccentric phase you stay pronated and at the bottom you get back to neutral grip.
* This will hit your brachialis and other flexors (the muscles related with golfer's elbows) from different angles.
* The key here is that for rehab / prehab purposes you do the eccentrics phase slower (2-4 seconds) and stay on the high rep ranges (8-14).
* For additional conditioning, you can add a fat grip

# Tuck Handstands: ""Tuck So You Don't Suck""

Lack of overhead mobility? Weak shoulders and upper back? The **tuck handstand will fix most of the issues around the shoulders that are limiting your handstand progress**. Here's how:

* When you get into a tuck handstand position your hips are bent 90º and your knees closed. This means that:

1. You're forced to open your shoulders (**more mobility**)
2. You increase the load on your shoulders and upper back (**more strength / stability**)

* I started doing this exercise first **facing the wall**, which may force you to open more your shoulders. At the beginning you may not be able bent the hips 90º but try to build to do that.

&#x200B;

Finally, big thanks to the Bodyweight Warrior ( u/MovementTom ) for teaching these great exercises. Stick to these exercises for at least 4 weeks and I promise you won't be disappointed :)"

I work out seven days a week unless I am too exhausted from work. Usually I separate them by pull, push, skill, and cardio day. 

Pull day is ONLY pull-ups. As many reps and variations as I can get in an hour.
Push Day is solely dips and handstand push-ups.
Skill days are lever practice and handstand practice.
Cardio is usually 3-4 times a week.

I did a COM analysis of a one-armed handstand!,sandusky_hohoho,536,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6h7p61/i_did_a_com_analysis_of_a_onearmed_handstand/,1497449156.0,"Hello! Here's the analysis gif - http://i.imgur.com/wNrKeFS.gifv

So, I did a simple mechanical analysis of a video of [Artur Bezkorinnyy](https://www.instagram.com/arturbezkorinnyy) doing this insane series of one-armed handstands. Dude is really good at handstands. I mean. Holy crap, right? 

In this gif, the white circle with the black X represents Artur's Center of Mass (COM), which is the approximate average position of all the mass of his body. The human body is very complicated [citation needed], but the COM is a single point that provides a good approximation of the full mechanical state of Artur's body. Specifically, by looking at the relationship between the position of the COM and the limits of the Base of Support (BOS, vertical white/black lines), you can gain a lot of insight into the stability of the physical system that is Artur's body. 

When doing a handstand where the hands are flat on the ground (not gripping anything), it is only possible to *push* on the COM;  Artur can shift around the pressures under his hands to apply force to his COM to push it around within the limits of the BOS. However, (neglecting weird transient torquey movements) he can never *pull* on it. That means that his COM *must* remain within the limits of the BOS (i.e. the black X must stay inside the dotted vertical lines). 

As long as the COM is within the limits of the BOS, he can adjust the forces he's applying to the ground to push the COM back towards the center of the stable region. However, if it ever crosses one of those boundaries, he could **never** pull it back inside (without moving his hands). The only forces he could apply would serve to push the COM farther away - A status we refer to in the field as ""falling over."" 

But of course, he doesn't do that, because he's stupid good at handstands. Way to go, Artur!

First, I stabilized the [original gif]( http://i.imgur.com/iFoienm.gifv) with Adobe After Effects to correct for Wobbly Magoo's fancy camera work (shoutout to /r/imagestabilization!). It's not perfect, there is still some residual motion in the image, but it does a pretty good job. 

From there, I pulled the stablilized video into a near program called [Tracker](http://physlets.org/tracker/), and manually tracked the individual joints on each frame of the video. The combination of a low quality, low light video with Artur's black-on-black clothing made this tricky, which is why the markers tend to shimmy around a lot (particularly on the shoulders and knees). As a result, you shouldn't take this analysis to be 100% veridical. In particular there is a point where the COM comes *very* close to the BOS, but I'd be willing to bet that the True BOS-COM margin was larger than that. Again, not perfect, but it'll do. 

Once I'd tracked all the images, I pulled the data into Matlab and generated this video. I used the [Winter Anthropometry tables](http://i.imgur.com/IxuUqO3.jpg) to estimate the segment and full body COMs. 

Video/Gif conversions were handled using a wonderful website called [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com)

Any way to pack on muscle WHILE doing long cardio sessions?,rawinvestments,531,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/nkk19n/any_way_to_pack_on_muscle_while_doing_long_cardio/,1621928368.0,"I am a college basketball player and I am playing ball at least 1-2 hours every day. This summer I have been tracking macros, getting 4k cals, 200g protein, lifting hard and consistently with the intent of really getting some muscle on my frame. (Current 168lbs 6’2) 

A friend of mine just told me that doing so much cardio every day is going to make all my hard work nearly pointless, due to the amount of cardio I am doing on the side. Problem is I can’t stop hooping because I have to stay sharp for the season. Is there ANY way I can reap the benefits of a bulk while still doing this amount of cardio? I have been lifting first and playing ball 30min after my workout for 2 hours or so."

**Story:**
In 2015 I was drinking and eating to excess regularly. Combined with having never really exercised I was very heavy after leaving university (where I also became a massive stoner). One morning I came downstairs after a really heavy night, when my younger brother (who has been lifting since he was probably 13) saw me in the kitchen gorging on junk food and said ""Brother, if you keep eating and drinking like this, by the time you are 30, you will be obese"". I didn't really believe him at the time, as I thought I wasn't that out of shape. However I decided to get a gym membership because I thought it couldn't hurt. I started by following a really simple full body routine I found online 3 days a week, starting each session with either 5 minute intense rowing or 15 mins stationary bike. At this time I was not really paying attention to my food intake, just trying to eat less (basically living off salad and hummus + pitta). In 6 months I lost about 15Kg.

Around 1 year in I decided to buy a bike and cycle to work (about 7Km a day). During this time, I started using MyFitnessPal, I was still regularly drinking to excess and I was eating way under my TDEE (eating around 1200Kcal a day). This caused me to become very underweight and weak, as you can see in the second pic. I was constantly hungry, but not loosing any more weight. I had lost most appreciable lean mass, but because I was skinny and because I was not seeing any muscle definition, I kept lowering my Kcals and upping my cardio (more cycling, sometimes up to 100Km a week). I felt like shit CONSTANTLY and my numbers in the gym were staying the same or dropping. I didn't weigh myself at this time, but looking at the pic I'd say I was around 65Kg.

Around June 2016 (1 months after the second pic) I came off my bike and broke my collarbone. This prevented me from doing ANY exercise for 4 months, during which time I put some weight back on (all fat though), but was starting to look a little less sickly.

Once I could start working out again (around October 2016), I actually decided, ""hey I'm gonna try do this thing properly"" and so I started cycling again (a lot less though) and began my journey into calisthenics. I never actually went back to the gym, instead buying adjustable dumbbells and a free standing pull up bar/ dip station.

First I fixed my diet by making sure I was getting enough protien. Then I started following the RR. Progress came, and within the first year, I was hitting all the upper numbers and progressions in the RR (praise be to the RR). I also bought rings (best decision EVER!)

My progress started to stall around October 2017, at which time I stated adding more volume and doing a push-pull routine of my own devising. This actually turned out to be a really big mistake, as my volume was way too high for my recovery capacity, so I started to stall again and getting minor injuries. I was also neglecting core and shoulder stuff, in favour of more volume during my workouts, creating muscle imbalances and more injuries (my elbows and shoulders felt like shit ALL THE TIME).

Christmas last year was a big turning point for me. I discovered 3 athletes who became massive inspirations and decided to cut down drastically on drink and weed. Max True, Vadym Olenik and u/MarcusBondi were all massive advocates of training in different rep ranges with varying weights, so I decided to build myself a routine in which I could get my primary lifts up to a good weight in the 5x5 rep range, so in turn I could start training in different rep ranges. in late April, my lifts were up to reasonable weights (Pullups and dips were at +20kg 5x5), so I took a deload and now do the following

**Current Routine:**
As well as cycling to and from work 5 days a week (11Km a day), I stick to a high frequency routine, undulating the intensity and volume daily to suit my needs and recovery capacity. This basically means I train push-pull 6 days a week, but perform no more than 3 movements per day (plus 2 days a week I wake up early to do a core routine)

I love the freedom of this style of routine, as it allows me to perfom many movement variations throughout the week, as long as i log all my routines to make sure i'm progression in adding weight or reps.

The most important thing at this point for me is to work within my recovery capacity. I need to 'listen' closely to my body, and never going full tilt (undulating volume and intensity as dictated by my recovery). I like to work within rep ranges of: 3x3, 4x6, 5x5, 3x8, 4x10 & 4x12. Because I change my routine daily and the rep ranges and type of movement I do dictates what weight I add, It's hard for me to post an example routine, however I'll take a pic of my diary if it is of interest.

**Food:**
My food intake has varied massively throughout the past 4 years. Currently I do not track calories (stopped after I broke my collarbone in 2016) except protein. I use BCAAs in the morning, whey for hitting my protien goals and fish oil. One thing, I can usually feel if i've not had enough carbs, as my cycling suffers. My current daily food is the same 5 days a week, and varies a bit on weekends, but currently looks like this, which I prep ever morning:

8:30: 5g BCAA before cycling to work.

10am: Protien shake (banana, 150ml milk, 2 scoop whey, 1/2 tbsp chia seeds, 1/2 tbsp linseeds, 1/2 scoops oats)

12:30pm: 200g chicken, 200g quinoa, 50g frozen green beans

4pm: 2 hard boiled eggs, 2 sardines (co-workers hate me for this)

5pm: 170g low fat greek yogurt

5:30pm: an apple

6:30pm: 5g BCAA before working out

8pm: 1 scoop protein shake and a dinner equivalent to my lunch (changes daily)  

10pm: big spoonful of pure peanut butter.

**Tips/ things i wish I knew starting out**

Food is more important than routines

Never work to full capacity (absolute failure) if you cannot take the time to recover afterwards

Frequency over volume

Working in different rep ranges for best results

Alcohol and smoking kills gains

The food you eat dictates you aesthetic results (eat garbage, look like garbage!)

Warming up your joints (especially your shoulders, wrists and elbows) is the most essential part of the warmup to avaid injury

DO CARDIO!

Study Finds: Total energy expenditure has been falling owing to a reduction in basal metabolic rate and not in activity expenditure.,DoomGoober,533,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/130m9j8/study_finds_total_energy_expenditure_has_been/,1682602258.0,"A meta-analysis of 100+ studies, which involved 6000+ measurements of adults in U.S. and Europe, using doubly labelled water technique found:

>total energy expenditure has declined since the early 1990s – by about 7.7% in males and 5.4% in females.

>The results showed that in fact activity expenditure has slightly increased and that the decline is all down to a reduction in the energy we spend when we are at rest.

>One potential contributing factor is changes in our diet. We were able to see in mice that the make-up of the fat they ate affected their metabolism, but whether the same effects occur in humans requires verification.

TLDR: Subjects' average resting energy expenditure has decreased statistically significantly since 1990. This may contribute to societal weight gain and may be caused by changes in the types of fats we consume.

If this is the case, then calories in versus calories out still determines weight gain, but the food we eat can affect the rate of calories out, therefore the *types* of food we consume might affect weight along with the *calories* of the food we eat."
3 month - 6 month progress post: RR only - (M/24/6'1) 155lbs-195lbs,Sorlium1,532,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kz3snz/3_month_6_month_progress_post_rr_only_m2461/,1610877646.0,"The recommended routine was a life saver for me. I got exactly the results I was looking for by doing the RR with minimal equipment. I started a couple months into quarantine. I've missed a total of about 4 weeks interspersed for either trips, work, or sickness. In addition to this, I also do full contact weapons sparring 3x a week which is my cardio. Here's my main progress over 6 months:

Pullups: 3x3 sloppy to 3x8 with emphasis on form. I think my pullup progression has been slow because I've been adding around 7lbs per month (it's water and fat, not muscle, I was chronically undereating so my weight exploded once I started to actually eat more than once a day) done on a pull-up bar from the thrift for $5.

Squats: 3x12 BW squats - 3x8 archer squats

Dips: 3x3 negatives to 3x10, all done on an old pair of bar chairs

Rows: 3x5 bedsheet method to 3x10 wide grip inverted on my dining room table

Pushups: focused mostly on form here. 3x12 normal to 3x8 pseudo-planche

Core: 30 sec plank to 3x8 knee ab rollouts with a $20 amazon ab wheel. Currently able to do 1 standing ab rollout.

I know my exercise progressions aren't where they could be, but I was looking for a consistent workout routine I could do from home that would keep me feel better after 3 years of being a hungry skeleton. I wanted something that didnt eat up all my time and wouldn't impede my ability to do my weapons fighting. The RR routine was perfect and gave me exactly what I was looking for. I feel incredible, I'm much stronger, and my partner has been thrilled with the modest amount of muscle I've put on. 10/10. 

Diet was eating anything I could get my hands on. I limit my fried food and sugar but I do enjoy a good popeyes chicken sandwich and a cinnabon once in a while. I otherwise almost exclusively eat chicken, turkey, fish, simple carbs, peanut butter, beans, rice, and fruit. I don't drink soda or fruit juice and I drink a decent amount of coffee.

The final one was after a 3 week cut. I took that selfie and then immediately abandoned it cause I felt like shit. I look more like this most the time because I like food now: http://imgur.com/a/BycFCk6"

I've been going to a dedicated gymnastics gym for adult classes for the past two weeks. Some thoughts.,None,537,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/94db47/ive_been_going_to_a_dedicated_gymnastics_gym_for/,1533329392.0,"Awesome. 

I've been to five classes, all considered beginner level - three Rings and two Shoulder Mobility. 

**My background** 

 I didn't know what the word calisthenics meant a little over a year ago. I've been working out on rings for about 9 months. 

My first class the teacher said ""can you see me afterwords?"" so I did and he said ""You taught... yourself? I've never seen someone teach themself to this level before"". So there's proof of the greatness of r/bodyweightfitness . I can do strict muscle ups for reps, RTO dips, really good false grip etc (but we didn't do any of that)

**Class**

I thought I might pick up a cue here or there, it was a cheap ""try us out!"" deal. Every class we did very basic exercises with long rests. It's not really a workout except for the people who can't do a bunch of pullups and pushups. 

Boy was I wrong about only picking up a little though. My training has advanced more than I could have taught myself in another year. There are so many little cues at every inch of the movement that I could never have learned that on youtube, or even here on BWF. And it's not like the teacher was telling me it all -- we just did so many silly drills and then put them all together that lightbulbs were going off in my head every time. 

**Takeaway**

* The key to every upper body movement is in your shoulder position and scapulae position. Looking back, I'm disgusted how lazy my shoulder position was. Roll them forward, don't just push them forward. Pinch them back. Elevate. Depress. Control them and learn where they should be at every part of every movement. It. Is. The. Key. 

* Flexibility makes you stronger. This thought never even popped into my head until I experienced it. 

* Having perfect form makes you stronger. 

*  If you have the chance, attend an adult gymnastics class. I don't even care about the act of doing gymnastics -- my goal is to get really big with bodyweight -- and I wish so badly that I had $150/mo to continue training.

Where to Start With Core Exercises for Someone Who Has an Extremely Weak Lower Back and Anterior Pelvic Tilt,TheGreatAte,534,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8waub2/where_to_start_with_core_exercises_for_someone/,1530800725.0,"Hi everyone! First I want to give some background that I think may be relevant, but basically I'm starting to put together a core routine, however I've seen some worrying signs such as a lot of pain in my lower back when doing planks when supposedly I should be feeling it in my glutes and abs. This is making me think I might need to start with something else, but I wanted to hear your opinion.

A little background: I'm a teacher with mild scoliosis. This semester due to an increased administrative load I was spending 5 hours plus a day sitting while planning and grading and I developed some bad mid back pain. Went to the doctor and was told that I had a serious problem with my hip alignment and severe anterior pelvic tilt. I started two months of PT which has helped enormously with the back pain, but they recommended I start a routine for core and fixing the anterior pelvic tilt.

I found a routine for the pelvic tilt which basically consisted of glute bridges and some stretches. I'm only two weeks into it, but its been going well so I decided to incorporate some core exercises as well. This is where Ive run into a problem. While doing planks despite my best efforts to stay in a posterior tilt and flex my glutes and abs my lower back muscles ball up and after about 30 seconds its too painful to continue. From what I've heard this is not what you want from a plank.

I'm thinking this could be because my lower back is really weak, because of my anterior pelvic tilt, or some combination of the two. Should I focus on fixing the anterior pelvic thrust before doing planking? Are there any other exercises for this other than glute bridges I can use? Some videos seem to suggest that I should also focus on ab work outs that don't use the hip flexors. Help!"
"HEY, EVERYONE! November is here and it's PULL-UPS MOTIVATIONAL MONTH! Join us today!",nomequeeulembro,533,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7a2jyg/hey_everyone_november_is_here_and_its_pullups/,1509529493.0,"#Welcome to the Pull-up Motivational Month!

## What's this about?

Last month we really did our best to stay upside down in the Handstand Motivational Month! If you missed it [here goes a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/73l3wu/handstand_motivational_month_2017_join_us_today/)!

This month is all about pull-ups!   
Pull-ups are one of the most loved exercises out there. They are a compound move that develops a good deal of strength, an important foundation for calisthenics, a symbol of strength and all that while being really fun to do.

For the first week we'll go on about the basics about pull-ups and how to get started. The focus is to help you all who can't do a pull-up yet to attain it. For those who can do it you can use this opportunity to get even better! By the end of the month we hope most of you will have attained or improved your pull-ups and, most importantly, that you will have had a blast training this month!

## Proper Form and Variations  
**General**

- Straight arms at bottom!
- Try to drive your elbows down and back
- Chin over bar, but don't crane your neck to complete the reps!
- On rings get your elbows parallel to your torso or as close as possible

**Shoulders**    
When hanging from a bar you can be in a dead hang, also called passive hang, or in an active hang. In the passive hang your shoulders are in a relaxed position, covering your ears, while in an active hang they're engaged and pressing down.

- You should go to dead hang as long as that causes no pain and you have no past history of shoulder issues. This is harder, but develops strength in the fullest possible ROM, which is what we usually want.
- In case you have a history of shoulder problems then talk to your doctor about i Only a proper assessment may determine if you can go deadhang or not.
- A common cue is to depress and retract the scapula. [Click here if you're confused about what ""depress"", ""retract"" and some other words mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/positioning).
- Another often suggested cue is to ""break the bar"" or to try to pull your elbows inward/forward.

**Grip**

- Supinated grip (chin-ups) is easier for most people than pronated grip (pull-up). The difference is mainly the muscular activation in those movements. In a pronated position the biceps can't flex the elbow well and the weaker brachioradialis have to work more.
 - When using rings your grip will naturally shift as you go through the movement. That's normal, let it happen!
- Wide grip is generally harder than close grip. With wide grips you use more of your lats and teres major because these are the muscles responsible for adduction, which is what you do more of in a wide grip pull up. Again, both are great.
- Pick whatever grip you want to choose as a goal. You can also go from easier to hard, attaining chin-ups before pull-ups or narrow grip before wide grip.

**Core**

- Usually in Gymnastic Strength Training pull-ups are done in a hollow position. This helps build up core strength and endurance as well as drill the hollow position. [Click here if you're confused about what ""hollow"" and some other words mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/positioning).
 - When doing those your legs will naturally come up. That's fine, as long as you're not swinging on purpose.
- Bodybuilding style pull-ups allow the back to arch. This is usually a bit harder as you have more load on the arms and back.
 - When doing those let the back arch naturally. Don't purposefully arch the back.
- As with grip, which one you do is up to you. We usually recommend GST style for beginners because it drills the hollow position and teaches you to not arch you back if you move to L-sit pull-ups (which is the progression after pull-ups in the Recommended Routine).

## The Workout  
P.s: Pick a suitable progression (one where you can work in the recommended rep range) and work from there. Those are all denoted as Sets x Reps, or Sets x Reps x Time when applicable.

**Warm-up**    
Warming up when beginning you sessions is recommended. If you don't know what to do for your warm-ups then see the [Recommended Routine's warm-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_warm-up.3A_dynamic_stretches_to_get_the_joints_nice_and_loose_.28.7E5-10min.29).

**Pull-up Progression**   
*Skip those if you can't do 3x8 horizontal rows yet!*

- [Pull-up negatives](http://vimeo.com/76666801). 3x5 between 5 to 10 seconds.
 - Try to do those slower each session.
 - Even if you're going for chin-ups first you'll probably have no trouble doing those in a supinated (pull-up) grip.
- [Pull-ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsnbDcsZbpk) (or chin-ups) 3x5-8
 - If you can't do many of those yet then you can try ""filling"" the set up with negatives. For example, doing 3 pull-ups followed by 2 negatives lowering sloowly.
 - Achieving you first pull-up is a nice feat! Congratulations!
- After you've mastered pull-ups you can try harder variations, like L-sit pull-ups or weighted pull-ups.

**Row Progressions**    
Those will develop the basic strength you will need to start practising pull-ups    

- [Incline rows](https://youtu.be/rloXYB8M3vU) 3x5-8
 - If you're just starting and need to do those in a near-vertical position then it's fine to use a higher rep range, like 8-12, and reduce to 5-8 as the incline decreases.
 - Lower the bar and elevate the feet to make it harder when you hit 3x8.
- [Horizontal rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvkIaarnf0g) 3x5-8
 - When you're able to do 3x8 horizontal rows you can start training negative pull-ups!
- [Wide rows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yMRvsuk9Xg) 3x5-8
 - Keep working on your rows even after starting with pull-ups. Do pull-ups first for greater pull-up gains, though.

**Acessory (optional)**    
Those aren't necessary, but they can be helpful.

- [Hanging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIVg_KK_Uzs) 2x10-20s
 - Those are good if your grip is giving out on you. Can be done passively or actively, depending on your shoulder's situation.
- [Scapular Pull-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoE-C85ZlCE) 2x5-8
 - If you have trouble at the very start of a deadhang pull-up then this can help.
- [Isometric holds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktUuSF5vB3M) at top position 2x10-20s
 - Try it if you feel at the weakest in the top position of the pull-up. Shown here is a neutral grip, which is fine. Mixed grip also works well for those, but alternate hands accordingly.

I'm very happy that just pullups and dips can make you BULK UP!,None,537,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/141fj0e/im_very_happy_that_just_pullups_and_dips_can_make/,1685973670.0,"My physique doing just pullups and dips 

[https://imgur.com/a/ZumcAHO](https://imgur.com/a/ZumcAHO)

There's a lot more impressive physiques than mine on this sub, but I am very happy to know now that it is possible to bulk up with just pullups and dips! 

That's basically the post, but if you are a beginner and want to get a physique like mine and eventually surpass it, feel free to read on. 

1. Goal = lumberjack physique = wide back, big powerful chest, big arms.
   1. I used to have a skinny fit physique in my teens and early 20's, which only revealed itself when I took my shirt off, otherwise I looked like any other skinny guy. After getting a dad bod after marriage, I decided I wanted a bulked up physique this time that actually looked good with a shirt on. 
2. Achieved goal? = No. About 70% of the way. Wife called me a gorilla the other day lol and actually wants me to slim down. So that's progress!
3. Training period = 23 months so far (and hopefully for the rest of my life)
4. Diet = Nothing special. I eat whatever (I'm a grad student in my 30's, so no income), just work out hard to compensate. White meat (chicken) with rice and veggies usually these days but I also eat instant noodles or takeout too. I also eat some protein after workout (eggs or yogurt or chicken). 
   1. As I've been bulking up more, I've also been eating more calories. 
5. Supplements = None. No protein shakes or creatine = too much money. No steroids (as you can tell in the photos LOL). 
6. Routine = low reps x high sets = high total volume. 
   1. I start my timer. 5 - 6 pullups. Next minute, 5 - 6 dips. Next minute, back to 5 - 6 pullups. Next minute, back to 5 - 6 dips. 
   2. 60 minutes = 150 - 180 pullups and 150 - 180 dips. 
   3. I do this for 2 days and then on the 3rd day I do a leg day (which I added after the recommendation of this sub). And then the 3 day cycle repeats. No rest days unless overly fatigued or in pain (which is different from soreness or discomfort), or if life just really gets in the way. 
7. Progression = I've been training for just under 2 years. If I remember correctly, I started with something like 10 sets of 3 pullups, 3 dips. (If you are a beginner who cannot do pullups or dips, you can do bodyweight rows and pushups instead and get almost the same intensity workout and same results). I progress in 2 ways, by either...
   1. Working on mastering my form. Minimizing my kipping and making sure to do full range of motion with each rep. So for pullups, down position means elbows fully extended (locked out) and up position means chin fully above the bar. Also doing the movement under control rather than relying on momentum to half ass the reps. So even if the rep count stays the same or even decreases because I am stricter on my form, I am progressing. 
   2. Increasing the rep count in each set. That is why I'm doing 5 - 6 reps in my routine right now. 5 reps per set got a bit easy (150 pullups and 150 dips), but doing 6 reps for 30 sets is really challenging for me right now (180 pullups and 180 dips). So I am in the transition phase of doing 6 reps per set until it gets too difficult and then dropping down to 5 sets for the remainder of the workout (usually about 40 minutes in). 

And that's basically it. 

Some people may think this is overtraining, but I slowly built up to this over the last two years, making sure to stop immediately if I experienced any joint pain at all and taking a rest day if overly fatigued from the previous day's workout. Listening to my body and differentiating between mild soreness and actual pain helped me avoid any injuries. 

After 2 years of this, I've come to the conclusion that too many beginners worry about overtraining when they should instead worry about undertraining. The people who I've seen undergo incredible physique transformations are those who workout a lot, not those who workout only a little out of fear of overtraining. Our bodies are capable of a lot more physical activity than we give them credit for. 

Even for myself, although I still have a ways to go, I am now receiving compliments on my physique regularly. My male classmates (who I've known now for 2 years) are now calling me swole and my female classmates are now complimenting my fit. What I wear didn't change over the past 2 years but my physique did...I bulked up and fill out my shirts now which looks better than a skinny body in a shirt.

That's basically the post. Thank you for reading a fitness beginner's post. If you are also a beginner, I encourage you to work out consistently to see results! I think consistency is the key to success. I also recommend bulking up so your physique looks good in a shirt, which is going to be 99% of the time. I am much happier with this physique than when I was skinny fit in my teens with a 6 pack.

New Years 2023 Announcement: BWF Primer Follow-along Event + BWSF Routine Soft-Launch!,Captain_Nachos,532,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/zvy3cc/new_years_2023_announcement_bwf_primer/,1672091847.0,"# tl;dr - The [BWSF Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf) is here! This will eventually replace the RR as the sub's main routine once all the exercise progression videos are filled out. Also we're doing another 14 day Primer event starting on New Year's Day 2023!

# Pre-amble, Context, Blabbering:

Hi folks! And happy holidays to you all!

Nick-E here.

Long time no speak! Life has been real busy and time has flown! It has been a very unfortunate reality that the development of the sub resources, and in particular, [the routine overhaul plan I had laid out](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kfqmhl/official_rr_update_new_years_new_routines_coming/) just prior to the launch of the [BWF Primer routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) (first routine of those planned) at the start of 2021 has been on a long hiatus (until now! hehe).

This is because I started an accelerated masters degree program (in other words, living hell) that has been taking up exactly 103% of my time since mid-late 2021.

The big tragedy is as far as the [Bodyweight Strength Foundation (BWSF) Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf) (the next step from the [BWF Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) that will eventually act as replacement of the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/)) goes, I had nearly finished it by the time I started the degree, and it has been sitting in that state of near completion for about a year and a half now.

Thankfully the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) remained a decent next-step for all the [BWF Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) graduates in the meantime, but since I started this degree I've had my eye out for a time period where I'd be able to properly finish off and release the BWSF routine to give the [BWF Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) a proper deserving 'sequel', and to provide the much needed overhaul to the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) that has been a long time coming.

I'm still not finished with the degree (that'll be in late 2023), but over the winter holiday period I have the first proper break I've got so far and I want to take advantage of it!

Alongside that, because of just how well received it was to host a 14 day follow-along for the [Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) when it launched, me and the other mods thought it would be cool to do it again this New Years (and possibly make it an annual thing if it continues to be well-liked!) to give all the motivated new folks a fun communal start to their journey, and breathe a little fresh life into the sub and the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bwf) (which is really the heart of our community and where most of the good discussion goes on, and if you haven't joined yet you **absolutely should**.)

(I repeat, come say hi in our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bwf)!)

I'm going to go over what the [BWF Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) event looks like for new users who will have joined the sub recently first, and then get to my little special announcement after that!

# BWF Primer Follow-Along Event!

Acutely aware of the fact that its been 2 years since any news came from me about this or anything else, I'm going to start with a quick explanation of what the [BWF Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) is:

**If you have ever wanted to get started with exercise, but found it a bit physically tough to start a whole routine all at once or felt overwhelmed by the amount of reading required before your first workout, that's what the BWF Primer is for!**

The [BWF Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/) is a total-beginners program to get into bodyweight exercise. The way it works is as follows:

Starting from absolute 0, you will go through a guided 14 day period where every day you will be doing one or more of the following:

\- Learning a new exercise

\- Practicing that new exercise + previously learned exercises

\- Reading a chunk of training theory to learn what and why you are doing what you're doing

All of this is previously something you would have to tackle all at once in your very first session of a more complete program such as the [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) (RR), but this way, you can gently ease your way into it, and let your body and brain acclimate over 2 weeks.

At the end of the 2 weeks, you are left with a 3x per week full body workout program that you can keep up with indefinitely, or eventually graduate from onto a more advanced program (like the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/), or soon... the [BWSF Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf)!)

From New Year's Day onwards, each day, the corresponding Primer day will be posted both on the subreddit and announced on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bwf) for you to follow along with, and check in with others doing the same thing on how its all going!

If you've been looking to get started training, this is a great way to not only get some accountability for starting, but to potentially find a community of potential future friends! Lots of regulars on the discord server joined during the last New Years Primer event and are practically part of the furniture now, still going strong on their fitness journey.

[Here is a link to a collection page of all the past Primer Event posts in one place, so you can have a look at how it all went!](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kofo8l/bwf_primer_buildup_community_event_day_1_happy/)

Understandably for a New Year's event, it'll start on 1st of Jan 2023 and run til 14th of Jan 2023.

# [BWSF Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf) Soft Launch! (Finally!)

Now onto the more exciting stuff for the long-time users!

For those that have been following since [the routine overhaul plan I had laid out](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kfqmhl/official_rr_update_new_years_new_routines_coming/), you'll know that the [BWSF Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf) is basically designed to take place of the current [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) (or '[Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/)'). They fill the same niche in terms of the strength level they're appropriate for, but the [BWSF Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf) was designed with a lot of the longstanding critiques of the RR in mind. Instead of just updating the RR again as we did in 2017, I thought it would be good to get a fresh start, even if the final outcome was fairly similar in concept (beginner BWF routines necessarily cannot be THAT different from eachother at the end of the day).

One thing I have been acutely aware of in the last 1.5 years of sitting on a nearly complete routine that is meant to replace the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/), is that in having discussions with trainees in the discord server about their training, it has become harder and harder to actually ***recommend*** the '[Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/)', simply because of how glaring a lot of the critiques of it (that motivated this new routine creation) are. At the same time, because of logistical (and some personal health) issues, I've not been able to properly finish and launch the better alternative that I'd rather recommend to people.

In the last couple of weeks, however, I have been collating all that I had done already on the [BWSF Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf) and doing a little bit more, and what I am left with now is a 95% complete resource, only missing video examples for much of the exercise progression lists (most of which are the more advanced ones), mostly because I had wanted to film all of them myself for a sense of aesthetic homogeneity with the rest of the content.

I had hoped to film most of these myself, but due to the impact this degree has had on my ability to train consistently, some issues with my physical health and the consequent fact that I simply currently can't do free-standing handstand pushups anymore, for example, these lists are going to be incomplete for a while yet. The routine won't replace the RR in the subreddit's resources until then

At the moment, the resources I've written are all hosted on my site, but over the next couple weeks I will be migrating the information to be available all on the subreddit as well, just like the [BWF Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer/), so people don't HAVE to go to my site to access the content and that way no one can cry 'shill' :') .

Once everything is migrated to the subreddit and the video lists are done, the idea is that the BWSF will take the place of the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) as the actual main routine (alongside the primer) that is recommended to new users, and the [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) (and some other routines) will be moved but still be available in a sort of 'legacy routines' section. The [RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/) is, at this point, a massive part of BWF history as much as it is a routine so to remove it outright would be pretty criminal.

(Althought it will probably have to be rebranded to 'The Previously Recommended Routine' or 'The Routine Formerly Known as Recommended' /s)

I think ultimately, doing a bit of a soft launch so theres more of a gradual and public transition from the RR being the king routine of the sub to this new one will ultimately be for the best. It will be less of a jarring change, and the opportunity to get a tad of community feedback on the new routine will help to make sure its as much of an improvement as possible as it's being finished. Alternatively, if people seem to absolutely hate the idea of the BWSF routine replacing the RR, then that's also valuable information to know before we do all the work of editing up the wiki, but I'd hope everyone reads the routine and realises how much of an improvement it is!

On that note, here's a nice itemized list summarising the biggest broadest differences between the BWSF and RR.

# [BWSF Routine](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf) vs the current/'old' [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/)

1. No more mandatory blanket recommendation of a very long warmup that's useful for some people and an unnecessary waste of time for others
2. Greater range in reps  and rest based on the exercise performed and its role in the program because scientific understanding on the topic has evolved, and so 5-8 reps for everything is not actually believed to be the best approach for general strength/hypertrophy development anymore
3. Removal of dips in favour of the pike pushup for an absolute myriad of reasons, not least because dips cause a lot of people costochondral pain and the old routine is missing a true overhead push
4. Removal of excessive number of core exercises in favour of fewer, more bang for buck exercises
5. Simplified by removing all the supersets and trisets (Although if you prefer them, by all means do it that way)
6. Strict strength pre-requisites for pull-ups and pike-pushups to speed up journey through initial progressions and improve rep quality
7. Related to above; removal of stop-gap exercises (e.g. scapular pulls, arch hangs, etc.) for people to do before they hit the strength requirements for pullups that are ultimately a very inefficient use of time and energy.
8. Program templates for 3, 4 and two different ways of 6 times per week training frequency, all closely matched for weekly volume to be as equal as possible
9. Way shorter and easier to read
10. Has a pre-requisite strength requirement to do the program (3x8 Pushups and Horiz. Rows with good form, same as the Primer Graduation requirements!)
11. Has an intended end/'graduation' goal before moving on to a more specialised routine, rather than trying to be effective indefinitely
12. Different, better exercise progressions, with handy dandy homemade flowchart graphics to make understanding them easier, more expansive leg exercise progressions and less fear of ""adding weight"" as a progression
13. Premade workout log for people that dont have/don't like using apps

\----

The result of these differences is a program that hopefully:

\- requires much less time to read on the first go

\- is more accessible for people who dont have a long period of free time 3x per week, but may have a shorter period of time free 4/6 times per week

\- is much tighter in time to completion

\- is more effective overall due to better exercise selection

\- is more focused on being good at what it should be good at (beginner strength routine), rather than trying to be good at everything indefinitely

\- is more enjoyable!

# That's all for now!

If you have any desire to learn more or have a chat (and in case you've not got sick of me pointing out that it exists yet), the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bwf) is the best place to go! I'm there at least a little while most days so would be happy to answer questions there when I'm available

Thanks for reading this long!

[2 years progress] My journey with BW,tucaloca,534,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/s8ia0t/2_years_progress_my_journey_with_bw/,1642683086.0,"Hello squad, how is everyone doing? Hope you'all doing okey and training hard. I'm going to post like I did last year with my year progression (had to delete my other account srry) to show that this sub got everything you need to train. (Please be patiente with my english, mistakes will be made)

A bit of background: 27M started doing calisthenics 2,5 years ago exclusively, I don't lift weights except for weighted excercies. I have scoliosis and a herniated disc and that somehow is the only inspiration I need to train. If I'm in shape I don't have any problems but when I stop... oh boy, I can't even stand still for 10 min.

Anyways, after a surgery 3 years ago I started doing the Recommended routine on and off. Got the hang of it and at one point i said to myself ""This s\*\*t really works"" and I took it serious.

Took me about a year to complete all progressions doing 3 times a week with the classic “3 pairs and a triplet”. Then I switched to a full body routine with my specific goals (handstand and manna) about 6 months. I was still on begginer levels acording to Overcoming gravity 2.0

From the last 7 months I've doing push pull leg with a lot of success and I think is neither better or worse, just different. I was very used to doing full body and I was aching more when I switched but then it gave me more energy to focus on less things and that's when things started to shine.

If needed will upload my routine and my goals, just wanted to share what you can achieve if you set your mind and I aprove 200% this subreddit.

**00. FUNDAMENTALS**  

*ROPE SHOULDER MEASUREMENT: 12-INCH (30 CM) CLEARANCE*  

A rope length equal to the distance from the jumping surface to your shoulder is ideal for mastering the 15 basic jumping techniques and can enable you to produce up to 200 RPM (3.3 RPS). A rope adjusted at shoulder height will clear your head by about a foot (30 cm) as you execute basic jump rope movements. As you become more proficient at jumping, you can reduce your rope length so that the rope clears your head by 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm) during high-speed jump rope training sessions. As noted earlier, consider carefully whether making such an adjustment will simulate the movement and energy demands of your sport better than the shoulder measurement does.

To use the shoulder measurement to determine your proper rope length, follow these steps.  

1. Stand on the center of the rope with one foot.  
2. Pull the handles up along the side of your body so that the ends of the handles extend no higher than your shoulder. If the handles extend beyond your shoulders, the rope is too long, which will cause excessive drag through the air, reduce the rope’s rotational speed, and increase the frequency of catches and tangles. These effects, in turn, will reduce your duration of continuation, even if you are using a lightweight speed rope.  

If the rope is too long, adjust the length by temporarily tying knots in the rope. Though it may slightly reduce your rope-jumping efficiency, you may need to tie more than one knot on each side in order to establish the proper rope-jumping length. Once you become comfortable with the proper rope length, take out the knots and make a permanent adjustment to an appropriate rope length. Avoid cutting the rope too short, since doing so may force you to purchase another rope.  

*GRIP*  

1. Grip the handle with your thumb and index finger on the foam grip or at the center of the handle.
2. Wrap your hand around the handle.
3. Maintain a grip that is firm yet comfortable and relaxed. To avoid wrist soreness, never use a tight grip.
4. Turn the rope by making 2-inch (5 cm) circles with your wrists.
5. Keep your elbows lightly tucked to your sides without letting them make contact with your rib cage.
6. Position your hands on a horizontal plane no more than 2 inches (5 cm) lower than your
hips. If you find that you must position your hands on a horizontal plane above your hips, shorten your rope. Jumping with your hands held above hip level reduces your intensity levels, or revolutions per minute (RPM), and your duration of continuation.
7. Keep the rope handles parallel with the jumping surface.  

*RESTING POSITION*  

Rope behind your knees, arms extended forward, just below just level, hands gripping the rope.  

*BASIC JUMPS:*  

BOUNCE STEP
1. Jump with your feet together.
2. Jump just high enough to clear the rope (no more than 3/4 inch [1.9 cm] from the jumping surface) by pushing from the balls of your feet while slightly bending your knees and flexing your ankles.
3. Land lightly on the balls of your feet.
4. Stay on the balls of your feet and repeat steps 2 and 3.  
5. Do not double bounce  

ALTERNATE FOOT STEP  
1. Jump by lifting your knees forward without kicking your feet backward (kicking your feet behind you while executing this technique can cause your feet to catch the rope). You may raise your nonjumping foot a little higher than an inch (2.5 cm) from the jumping surface.
2. Swing the rope around and jump over it with one foot; on the second turn of the rope, jump over it with your other foot.
3. Continue alternating your feet (lifting your knees as if you were jogging in place) at a slow pace until you establish a comfortable jumping rhythm.
4. Count only the jumps with your right foot, then multiply by two to calculate your total number of jumps per set.

**01. STEP 1: BASE PHASE - MASTER BASIC TECHNIQUES**  

ULTIMATE GOAL: 1 set of 500 consecutive jumps, 4-5 times per week, at min 160 RPM  
TECHNIQUES: Bounce Step, Alternate Foot Step  
TOTAL TIME: 4 weeks  

*a. BASE PHASE LEVEL 1: DEVELOPING JUMP ROPE PROFICIENCY*  

GOAL: 140 jumps without miss in 5 sessions per week  
TECHNIQUE: bounce step, then alternate-foot step  
TIME: 2 weeks  

1. Practice to master the two basic skills of jumping; master the bounce step first, then move on to the alternate-foot step.
2. Your goal is to execute 1 set of 140 jumps without a miss in 5 sessions per week.
3. Begin with as few as 5 to 10 jumps per set. Do a total of 10 sets per training session. Jump for 5 minutes. Rest as needed between sets.
4. Gradually increase your number of jumps in each set by adding 10 to 25 reps in subsequent sessions as your timing and jump rope capacity improve. As your proficiency improves, you will need fewer sets to reach 140 consecutive jumps in each session.
5. Follow the same steps for mastering the alternate-foot step.  

*b. BASE PHASE LEVEL 2: DEVELOPING JUMP ROPE CAPACITY*  

GOAL: 1 set of 500 consecutive jumps, 4-5 times per week, at min 160 RPM  
TECHNIQUE: Alternating bounce and alternate-foot step  
TIME: 2 weeks  

The following strategy will help you develop basic jump rope capacity:
1. Perfect the two basic skills of jumping (the bounce step and the alternate-foot step) so that you can easily make the transition between one skill and the next without losing rhythm and timing. Make 4 jumps with one skill before executing the next one. For ex- ample, execute 4 bounce steps followed by 4 alternate-foot steps while jumping no more than 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) off the surface on each jump. By the end of the first week, you should be able to perform 200 consecutive jumps. Next, try to reach 500 total jumps in 3 sets; then aim for 500 total jumps in 2 sets.
2. I recommend that you break your goal of 500 total jumps into 2 or 3 sets. Here are three possible combinations:
150 + 200 + 150 200 + 300 250 + 250
3. Work up to 1 set of 500 consecutive jumps (without catches or tangles of the rope) while alternating between the bounce step and the alternate-foot step at a minimum pace of 160 RPM.  

**02. STEP 2: CONDITIONING PHASE - DEVELOP SKILLS AND ENDURANCE**  

ULTIMATE GOAL: 10 min of jumping at 180 RPM  
TECHNIQUE: Varied, including double-jump or optionally triple jump  
TIME: 6+ weeks  

*c. CONDITIONING PHASE LEVEL 1: (Single Jump)*  

GOAL: 10 min of jumping at 180 RPM  
TECHNIQUES: Varied  
TIME: 4 weeks  

• Week 1: Progress from 500 jumps in 1 set to 5 to 10 minutes of continuous jumping at a pace of 160 to 180 RPM while alternating between the bounce step and the alternate-foot step.  
• Week 2: Continue building from 5 to 10 minutes of jumping while incorporating the basic bounce and alternate-foot step, but expand your jump rope training regimen to include the high step, side straddle, forward
straddle, skier’s jump, and bell jump. Maintain your commitment to jump for 5 to 10 minutes per session using the two basic techniques while adding the new techniques. Try to perform 500 repetitions of the new skills during each session. Try to maintain an intensity level of 160 to 180 RPM (2.7 to 3 RPS). In order to gradually build your jump rope capacity to 500 jumps, I recommend that you break these sessions into 2 to 4 sets, with at least 1 set consisting of 150 or more continuous jumps (or up to 50 seconds at 3 RPS). Try to rest for 30 to 60 seconds between sets (taking extended recovery time reduces the training benefit for your anaerobic energy system). Ideally, add one new jump rope skill to each session during the second week and then combine all the skills in the week’s  Final training session.  
• Week 3: Expand your regimen from the basic bounce and alternate- foot step, continuing to build from 5 to a total of 10 minutes of jumping, this time by adding the half twister, full twister, X-foot cross, forward shuffle, and backward shuffle. Maintain a commitment to jump 10 minutes per session using the two basic techniques while adding the new techniques for this week. Try to perform 500 repetitions total of the new skills during each session. As with the previous week, keep your intensity level between 160 and 180 RPM, but this time establish a goal of 300 continuous jumps. During your final training session for this week, include each of the 10 new rope-jumping techniques. Again, add at least one, but not more than two, of the new techniques during each training session.  
• Week 4: Jump to increase your jump rope capacity from 5 to 10 minutes while mixing in new skills with the two basic jumps. Enhance your repertoire by adding the heel-to-toe, backward, arm crossover, arm side swing, and side swing jump. Commit to jumping for 10 minutes per session using the two basic techniques while adding the new techniques for this week. Try to perform 500 repetitions of the new skills during each session. Maintain appropriate intensity levels and limit your recovery times to 30 to 60 seconds after each set. Also, challenge yourself to keep jumping until you reach 500 continuous jumps in a sequence that incorporates each of the 15 jump rope techniques. Again, add at least one, but not more than two, of the new techniques to each training session.  

*d. CONDITIONING PHASE LEVEL 2 - POWER TECHNIQUES (Double Jump)*  

GOAL: 10 minutes  
TECHNIQUE: Varied, but including power jumps (two rotations in one jump)  
TIME: 2 weeks  

• Week1,sessions1&2: Complete 5 minutes of jumping,incorporating the 15 techniques you learned in level 1. Then add the basic power jump and the power alternate-foot step. Practice jumping for 5 minutes with these new techniques in sets of 25 jumps with rest periods in between as needed.  
• Week1,sessions3&4: Complete 5 minutes of jumping, incorporating the 15 techniques you learned in level 1, including the basic power jump and the power alternate-foot step techniques. Then practice for 5 minutes with the new power jumps, in this case the power high step, the power side straddle, and the power forward straddle in sets of 25 jumps with rest periods in between as needed. In addition, mix in rotating cycles of 10 to 15 jumps each for the 15 basic techniques you learned in level 1.  
• Week2,sessions1&2: Complete 5 minutes of jumping, incorporating the 15 techniques you learned in level 1, including the  ve new power jumps you learned in week 1. In the next 5 minutes, add sets of 25 jumps of the power skier’s jump, power bell jump, and power X-foot cross with rest periods in between as needed.  
• Week2,sessions3&4: Complete 5 minutes of jumping, incorporating the 15 techniques you learned in level 1, including the eight new power jumps you learned in previous sessions. During the subsequent 5 minutes, add sets of 25 jumps of the power arm crossover and the power side swing with rest periods in between as needed. Mix in with rotating cycles of 10 to 15 jumps each for the 15 basic techniques you learned in level 1. Establish a goal of 300 or more continuous jumps, including all 25 jump rope techniques.  

Basic Power Jump:  

1. Start with the bounce-step stance.  
2. Execute three bounce-step jumps.  
3. On the fourth jump, bend your knees forward, push off, and jump at least 5 inches (13 cm) from the jumping surface while turning your wrists a little faster so that the rope passes under your feet twice in one jump.  
4. Repeat.  
5. When you have developed your rhythm and timing for this sequence, perform 2 consecutive power jumps, then 3, then 4, and so on.  
6. Once you are able to perform 20 consecutive power jumps, concentrate on decreasing the height of your jump to 2 inches (5 cm) off the ground.  

*CONDITIONING PHASE LEVEL 3: OPTIONAL ADVANCED TECHNIQUE (Triple Jump)*  

I recommend that you attempt the triple jump only after you have mastered all of the power jumps. The triple jump represents the beginning of level 3 and requires you to exert more push upon takeoff and greater control upon landing in order to minimize impact and minimize your risk of injury. This technique is not required, but it can serve as an additional way to challenge yourself to move on to another level once you have mastered all of the 25 techniques included in levels 1 and 2.  

**03. STEP 3: SPORTS TRAINING PHASE**  

GOAL: 10 minutes, 180-240 RPM minimum  
TECHNIQUE: Varied  
TIME: 2-4 weeks  

• Week 1, session 1. Warm up with 3 minutes of the bounce step and the alternate-foot step at an intensity level of 160 to 240 RPM. Spend 2 minutes integrating the skier’s jump and the forward straddle at the same intensity level (but trying to stay above 180 RPM). Next, spend 5 minutes adding as many as 10 more techniques of your choice into a combination regimen at intensity levels that reach the range of 3.7 to 4 RPS for 15 to 30 seconds at least three times. Try not to allow your intensity level to fall below 180 RPM at any time during this 5-minute session.  
• Week 1, session 2. Warm up with 3 minutes of the bounce step and the alternate-foot step at an intensity level of 180 to 240 RPM. Then spend 2 minutes integrating the side straddle and X-foot cross at the same intensity level. Next, spend 5 minutes adding 5 more techniques of your own choice into a combination regimen at intensity levels that reach the range of 3.7 to 4 RPS for 30 to 45 seconds at least three times. Try not to allow your intensity level to fall below 180 RPM at any time during this 5-minute session.  
• Week 1, session 3. Warm up with 3 minutes of the bounce step and the alternate-foot step at an intensity level of 180 to 240 RPM. Then spend 2 minutes integrating the bell and skier’s jump at the same intensity level. Next, spend 5 minutes incorporating all 25 techniques from levels 1 and 2 into a combination regimen at intensity levels that reach the range of 3.7 to 4 RPS for 45 to 60 seconds at least three times. Try not to allow your intensity levels to fall below 180 RPM at any time during this 5-minute session.  
• Week 2, session 1. Perform 4 minutes of continuous jumping with the 25 techniques from levels 1 and 2 at an intensity level of 160 to 240 RPM. Then do 6 minutes of continuous rope jumping at intensity levels ranging from 3 to 4 RPS (180 to 240 RPM) and including two blasts of maximum RPM for 60 to 90 seconds. At no time should you allow your RPM to drop below 180 during this last 5-minute set.  
• Week 2, session 2. Perform 2 minutes of continuous jumping with the 25 techniques from levels 1 and 2 at an intensity level of 160 to 240 RPM. Then do 7 minutes of continuous jumping at intensity levels ranging from 3 to 4 RPS (180 to 240 RPM) and including at least two blasts of maximum RPM for 90 to 120 seconds. At no time should you allow your RPM to drop below 180 during this last 7-minute set.  
• Week 2, session 3. Perform 2 minutes of continuous jumping with the 25 techniques from levels 1 and 2 at an intensity level of 160 to 240 RPM. Then do 8 minutes of continuous jumping with these techniques at intensity levels ranging from 3 to 4 RPS (180 to 240 RPM) and including two or more blasts of maximum RPM for 120 or more seconds. At no time should you allow your intensity level to drop below 180 RPM during each set.  "

The Pull-Up is Three Motions?!?,DoomGoober,528,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dch9mg/the_pullup_is_three_motions/,1570053376.0,"There seems to be some confusion about the pull-up. A pull-up is actually three main motions smoothly mashed together into what feels like one motion. They are as follows:

1. [Shoulder Depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYANgxHA8b4)
2. [Shoulder Extension](https://youtu.be/xZmqGeChwjs?t=22)
3. [Elbow Flexion](https://youtu.be/p-8izkNkcBw?t=42)

Here's what a [pull-up looks like if you do each motion in a sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP_jR2MC650) rather than mashed together. If you're following the RR, you may recognize that the scapular pull-up does shoulder depression and the arch hang does shoulder extension (that's why those are pre-requisites to the pull-up!) Simply add some bodyweight curls to do elbow flexion and you're doing all the parts of a pull-up.

Let's look at each motion:

1. **Shoulder Depression.** There are basically four scapular motions: depression, elevation, retraction, and protraction. In the RR, dips and pull-ups do depression, push-ups do protraction and rows do retraction. Notice the RR doesn't have a shoulder elevation exercise! This is why I think pike-push-ups should replace dips in the RR since pike-push-ups are vertical push with scapular elevation.
2. **Shoulder Extension.** Shoulder extension involves the lats which is partly why people call pull-ups a ""back"" exercise. However, in a regular pull-up the shoulder extension working in conjunction with the elbow flexion. Since elbow flexion is performed by the biceps and brachioradialis, which are smaller than the lats, elbow flexion will often be the weak point of the pull-up, not the lats. Also, the pull-up bar limits the range of motion of shoulder extension as once the chest hits the bar, you can't shoulder extend any further. This is why people complain that the lats are not getting a workout during pull-ups: the arms are giving out first. You can add more lat activation to pull-ups by driving the elbows back, which requires more shoulder extension ROM. If you really want a lat workout, look at straight arm lat pull motions like the front lever or front lever pulls.
3. **Elbow Flexion.** For chin-ups, it's more bicep and less brachioradialis. For pull-ups, it's less bicep and more brachioradialis but regardless of grip, pull-ups/chin-ups work both.

Thinking of the pull-ups as three motions, we come to the following conclusion: A ""full rep"" pull-up has the elbow fully flexed and the shoulder extended as far as the bar will allow. This is well above ""chin over bar."" We can also come to an interesting set of ideas: You should try to do ring pull-ups practically to muscle-up transition height in order to maximize shoulder extension. Also, interestingly, on bar pull-ups if you don't fully flex your elbow, you have more room before your chest hits the bar, and you can extend your shoulder further, which allows you to pull higher on bar. This trades elbow flexion ROM for shoulder extension ROM.

Overall, the pull-up is three motions mashed into one. Combining the motions in such a way introduces limitations that don't exist if you do the motions separately. However, compound motions are generally viewed as more beneficial as they require coordination of muscles which is how most real-world strength operates. Additionally, doing a compound motion hits more muscles with a shorter workout time. Understanding the three parts should allow people to find their weaknesses better and isolate them as well as better understanding what the pull-up is or is not."
One-year progression with Bodyweight Fitness,nunped,531,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/bpb8p3/oneyear_progression_with_bodyweight_fitness/,1558005282.0,"#TL;DR
This is going to be a long one, so:

[Gallery with progression pictures](https://imgur.com/a/LHUYFDx)

Male, 34y, one-year progression with 9 months of the Recommended Routine (RR) and 3 months of FitnessFAQs Body by Rings (BBR).

#Background
Male, 33 years old when I started. Height 168cm. Weight dropped from 69kg to 67kg.

I was a competitive swimmer until my early teens, but I stopped all forms of physical activity almost 20 years ago. Occasionally, I went swimming once a week, but very rarely in the last few years.

I work about 50-60 hours/week and have 2 small children (3y and 9m).

# Motivation and why BWF
I’ve been thinking about exercising for years, but there were always good excuses to postpone it (mainly, not enough time on top of laziness). I could never find the time and courage to go to a gym.

One day, I listened to a TED Radio Hour podcast that was all about motivation and just doing the stuff you’ve been delaying. So, I decided to find a routine of home exercising and start that same day.

I had no clue about what calisthenics was or that it even existed at all. After using google for a bit, I stumbled in this subreddit and was drawn to the RR. 

Not going to lie, it was overwhelming in the beginning. The warm-up itself was quite lengthy and full of movements I wasn’t familiar with. And then, what’s a row? What’s a dip? It was a new world for me, and it got me interested! I started doing it and researching what else there was related to this all bodyweight fitness stuff.

# Progressing through the RR
I’ll give you my thoughts and struggles with the progression through all main movements.

Overall, it's such a nice routine for a beginner, and I'm truly thankful for all the work you put into it.

## Push-ups
From 3 sets of 7 bad form push-ups to 3 sets of 8 archer push-ups on rings.

Well, everyone knows push-ups. And I could do a few, but soon realized I was doing everything wrong. Flaring the elbows, partial ROM…

The first month was to fine-tune the form, then I allowed myself to increase the numbers and go to diamond push-ups and a few months after, Pseudo-planche push-ups (PPPUs)

PPPUs felt really weird in the beginning. I was feeling that my lean varied from workout to workout. I started putting my feet against the wall and measuring the distance to my hands. As I didn’t enjoy anyways, I started doing Archer Push-ups. These felt a lot harder than I imagined in the beginning. It took me a couple of weeks to get to a satisfactory form, and I progressed to 3 sets of 7 before I started BBR.

## Dips
From barely holding a support-holed to 3 sets of 9, on rings.

Before rings, I used two chairs for dips, and it worked very well.

I only started dips when the RR changed. And the first time I did 3 in a row! I was stoked! Next day, my chest felt like being stabbed over and over again… But I tried to do a few more dips in the workout that followed. Big mistake…

I faced chest pain, mainly with a deep breath, for more than a week. I stopped dips in that period. But I tried again as soon as the pain stopped, 3 sets of 3. Another mistake…

Two more weeks with chest pain.

Finally, I understood that rushing was not a good idea. I regressed to negatives for a bit, and then started with just one dip. Next workout, 1 + 1. Next one, 1 + 1 + 1. And so on…

Eventually, got to 3 sets of 8 with 6kg. And never got chest pain again.

Now, I’m up to 3 sets of 9, on rings.

## Rows
From 3 sets of 5 inclined rows (the sheet in the door method) to 3 sets of 6 one-arm rows on rings

Before I bought the pull-up bar, I used the sheet in the door method, as showed by Antranik. My wife wasn’t too happy about that… Soon, I got a pull-up bar (telescopic one) and it’s been an awesome tool!

I enjoyed a lot progressing through rows. Before BBR, I was doing with elevated feet and additional 6kg.

## Pull-ups
From being unable to break dead-hang to 3 sets of 8 on rings (my max was 10 pull-ups on bar, in January).

 Pull-ups are my proudest achievement until now. I couldn’t break dead-hang in the beginning and started with scapular pulls. It felt like they didn’t do anything, but they sure do help a lot!

Then, I got to negatives. The first time, I did one more or less controlled, and the second one was almost just falling down. I kept increasing the numbers, one per workout, and tried to reach the 10 seconds for each. When I got to 3 sets of 7, I achieved my first pull-up! This was 3 and a half months into the journey.

I progressed till 3 sets of 8 on bar, and now the same numbers on rings.

## Squats
From 3 sets of 8 squats, to 3 sets of 8 advanced shrimp squats.

Before shrimp squats, was doing deep step-ups, but it was not very rewarding to me, and I caught myself cheating a few times… 

Shrimps were very hard in the beginning, curiously, a lot harder in my right leg than my left one, mostly due to lack of balance. My hypotheses is: as I kick the soccer ball with the right leg, my balance leg is the left one.

Finally getting an advanced shrimp squat with the right leg, as awesome!

I’m working on getting the pistol squat, but very slowly now. BBR requires 4 days a week just for upper body. Most weeks, I can’t find the fifth day for legs workout. So, I’ve been skipping leg day a lot… Don’t worry, I’ll get back to it when I start with full-body workouts again.

## Nordic curls
For these, I anchor my feet under the pull-up bar. I’ve been progressing, by touching the floor with my nose, progressively further away from my feet. I still can’t do them with a straight body, as each time I increase the distance it looks like it’s exponentially harder.

## Core
I have an ab-wheel, and enjoyed doing the rollouts, but I’m using the rings now.

# Body By Rings

I won’t get too much into this, because I just completed 2/3 of it. I’ll write a review when I finish.

Overall, Rings were a great Christmas present! And I decided to buy BBR, to support a channel that taught me so much and to help me get started with this new equipment.

# Injuries

I had to stop a few weeks here and there. Once, because of a torticollis and twice due to low-back pain (probably due to carrying the kids around).

After the dips experience, I decided to never workout through pain, and to never rush anything. It took me 20 years to become lazy, I don’t need to solve it in 3 months.

# Nutrition
Well, this is a problem.

I’m not been paying any attention to calorie intakes, nutrients or other stuff. I just eat as I always did. We try to cook at home, and eat vegetables every meal. And that’s about it…

I also don’t know if I want to bulk or cut… Which probably means I’m happy with my weight for now.

# Overall feeling and everyday life changes
As you can see by the pictures, it’s not the most amazing change you’ll find here. I’m still proud of the progress and been getting some compliments by my wife (which, with two small kids, it’s very refreshing by itself).

Funny that I’ve been doing this 3 or 4 times a week, for about an hour, and it didn’t take time for anything else in my life. This was probably only couch hours laying around expecting me to use them.

I feel less tired overall, climbing stairs and walking mainly.

I workout in the evenings. Sometimes I’m truly tired from the job, but as it is mental tiredness, it improves a lot with the exercise, and I finish it feeling energized.

Most of all, I’m happy with myself and eager to keep going!

# Future
I want to get back to a full-body workout, 3 times/week, after I finish BBR. And try to find a 4th day for cardio. I would love to swim again, if not, probably rope skipping…

I’ve not been doing anything related to mobility/flexibility. For this next year, that’s my main goal: find a nice routine that I can stick with.

Regarding learning the cool stuff you guys already can do, I’d love to get to a one-arm pull-up and handstand push-ups. As I’m small and light, it’s possible I can reach that stuff in the future, but no pressure.

# Thank you
This subreddit is a big reason for my persistence. I learned a lot with you guys, and check this almost every day. Thanks so much!

I try to give back with the posts where I gather scientific articles about a subject. I hope to keep posting these in the future."

I have to stick to this routine, for like 2-3 months, after that i'll likely buy a gym membership. But till then i wanna keep my body fit + get it ready for the gym

I already have been doing this on and off for sometime, but thought would ask if it's a good workout cause i don't wanna cause muscle imalances

I will be doing:

\- Variations of pushups, wide, diamond, narrow, elevated pushups etc...

\- Variations of pull ups, wide and close grip

\- squats

\- Variations of ab exercises

\- Jump rope for cadio ( around 10 / 15 minutes )

Also, should i do them daily? or should i do cardio daily and strength on alternate days? or should i do strength workout daily too?

This fits, perfectly in my time schedule :)

New Video: How to do the Perfect Low Lunge to Stretch your Hip Flexors,Antranik,530,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/54fhtq/new_video_how_to_do_the_perfect_low_lunge_to/,1474816386.0,"[In this follow-along video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGEpQ1BRx-4) I share with you the intricacies that turn the lunge into a **very effective** stretch for your hip flexors which are the muscles at the front of the thigh/hips. The muscles such as the [rectus femoris](https://i.imgur.com/BwwQ7Qb.jpg) and the [iliopsoas complex.](https://i.imgur.com/h3jMuSd.jpg))



##**Benefits:** 

* For people who sit a lot and don't stretch the hip flexors, they have often lost all hip extension and need to restore it. Stretching the hip flexors will help your hips **have more hip extension** (read: the ability to bring your thighs behind you without arching the lower back to compensate). 

* Lunges are a commonly prescribed basic stretch if someone is having lower back pain, because the iliopsoas complex (deep hip flexor) connects the thighs to the lower back, and if they're tight they pull on the lower back. Doing it in a low lunge is a very good start toward stretching them.

* The cues in the video (squaring, tucking, etc) are applicable to **ALL** hip flexor stretches, including high/standing lunges or the couch/wall quad stretch and so forth.

* **In regards to r/bodyweightfitness...** this stretch is excellent to do after a session of... L-sits, Seated leg lifts (aka compression work, which was coincidentally [my last video](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4zd7lp/struggling_with_the_lsit_lsits_require_strong/)),  Hanging leg lifts... anything that uses your hip flexors.

###Here is the [Link to the YouTube Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGEpQ1BRx-4) Let me know how you like it or have any questions!

tl;dw: I teach you how to square the hips (remember, it's always back-hip forward, front-hip backward), then my favorite way of getting people to tuck the hips (posteriorly tilt the hips using your hands) and small but important details like making sure the back foot is in line with the mat/carpet and the front foot is ahead of the knee and so on."

Never really warmed to body weight exercise as, contrary to what every fitness expert says isn't true, I DO tend to bulk up. I tend to gain muscle really easily. Historically just a couple of weeks of squats and my jeans are uncomfortably tight! 

I've been on and off with exercise over the years and usually just run on the treadmill. Well i've been quite consistent with the treadmill lately but I look like i've aged ten years!! My face looks so gaunt and i'm usually exhausted. I only really exercise to feel fit and healthy and to stave off anxiety but I feel like I dont want to continue as im losing too much weight. At this point id rather gain muscle and bulk up a little rather than look gaunt and frail. 

The question is, can I replace my cardio exercise with body weight exercise? Does it offer similar benefits like endorphin release/increase in energy etc. And how many times a week should I do it? Should I work different body parts separately or do a full body workout a few times a week.

I bought the programme a couple of weeks into our lockdown here in the UK as i was looking to have some sort of structured training programme outside of the gym.

I paid the $60 odd for the programme after having seen several videos on YouTube and enjoying them (I still enjoy them and think they are the best bit).

The programme is VERY basic and VERY generic. The whole members area feels neglected and it feels like his site was thrown together as quickly as possible, every page still has the default ""Lorem Ipsum..."" web text on it.

The  walkthrough of each programme is clumsy and not well laid out in a way that you could read it and follow the video tutorials easily. And the video tutorials are just snapshots from YouTube anyway.

The programme feels quite unrealistic in some ways. As you move on to intermediate you are still doing the basic movements (think push ups, pull ups, dips), but then sometimes it will have as a bonus ""do as many muscle ups as possible"". If you're someone who is trying to do 3 sets of 6-12 rep pull ups i don't think you'll be able to do even 1 muscle up.

The site says get in touch if you want to give feedback or complain, but you realise there is no actual contact us link on the site, you have to google it to find it, and i received no response anway.

Just my 2 cents. I'd hang on to your money and follow someone like FitnessFAQs who has a free and equally good if not better (constructed with more thought) programme."
How I got the Full Front Lever,Deanosaurus88,528,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mo5mdv/how_i_got_the_full_front_lever/,1618064525.0,"# How I got the Full Front Lever

I've been meaning to make this post for a while, but life has its way of keeping me busy.

I'd like to start with some **disclaimers**:

* I'm sharing this because after years of being part of this community I feel like I don't see enough posts of people sharing their success stories *alongside* the strategies they used to get there. Most posts seem to be on two ends of the spectrum: tons of posts of people seeking advice on how to achieve their goals, and then those, for lack of a better word, showing off (nothing wrong with this!) their achievements, but with little help/advice as to how others can mimic their success. Therefore, I'd like this post to be dedicated to giving back to the community and bridging the gap between that spectrum.
* I achieved the Full Front Lever (FFL / FL hereafter) in April 2020. I then transitioned onto One-Armed Chin-ups (OACU) only to get golfer's elbow in September 2020. Unfortunately FLs really aggravated the pain and so I had to stop them altogether for a long stretch of time, and eventually lost them. Once recovered, I have begun training again using exactly the same programming that I will outline here. I have absolute confidence that I will gain my FFL again (currently on the one-leg, foot-to-knee stage).
* There were lots of other factors going on, as there are in any workout programming (mine was Push-Pull split with mobility). But for the sake of space and specificity of this post, I'll only focus on the FL training aspects.
* Goes without saying but, this worked for me. Everyone is different, that's why some people get these skills easily while others have to dedicate huge amounts of time. By sharing this, I'm not suggesting it'll work for you, but perhaps if you've been trying other things unsuccessfully for a while and want a different approach, give it a try. Put it this way, you won't get any weaker.

# Quick Facts

* I have been into amateur weightlifting & bodybuilding for most of my life (m33). I currently weigh 72kg (158lbs) and am 170cm (5'7"") tall.
* I started implementing calisthenics from September 2019. For my FL work, that essentially only consisted of a few sets of (bad form) FL pulls.
* Transitioned to a calisthenics-only workout from December 2019. This is when I really started taking my strength skills training more seriously.
* I was simultaneously working on handstands (before every session), planche and dips (Push days), pull-ups (Pull days), leg work (split days) and core (split days - Vsits and Leg raises)
* The vast majority of my FL training was done on parallettes (like [these](https://imgur.com/a/NHIuqmn)).

# Programming

**Split**: *Push - Pull* \- off - *Push -* off - *Pull* \- off

**FL (Pull Day) Workout structure**:

A. FL isometric hold progression 5 x 6-10s (3-5"" rest)

B. FL pulls + negatives 3 x 3-6 (3"" rest)

C. FL rows 3 x 6-8 (3"" rest)

# Breakdown

**A. FL isometric hold progression**

Progression: *Tuck FL > Adv. tuck FL > One-legged tuck FL > One-legged foot-to-knee FL > One-legged foot-to-ankle FL > Straddle FL > FFL*

Details: Most of these progressions will be self-explanatory. A lot of progression guides make an irrational jump from Adv. tuck straight to Straddle, which from my experience is far too big a leap. Therefore, the real game changer for me was adding the incremental one-legged progressions (credit where due: it was our man u/Antranik that offered me this advice). I've represented the one-legged variations above as a 3-step progression (*One-legged tuck FL > One-legged foot-to-knee FL > One-legged foot-to-ankle FL*) but truth be told it is far more scalable than that - and that's precisely why it is far more effective. Start with the *One-legged tuck FL:* E.g. your right leg is fully extended, and your left leg is fully flexed with your knee pulled into your chest like a tuck. Each workout, attempt to incrementally *unflex* the bent leg so that it is a little further away from the chest, until bent at 90°. Then start to measure it by where the left foot is in relation to the extended leg: First by the thigh, then the knee ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/NHIuqmn)), then the calf, then the ankle. When you get to this stage, the straddle should be quite achievable, and you're literally inches away from a FFL!

**B. FL pulls + negatives**

This move is broken down into two components: the *pull* and the *negative*. For the pull, pull your body from the ground with straight arms (bear in mind: I trained on parallettes, not a pull-up bar, so smaller lever angle) using an easy progression and raise your body perpendicular to the floor. Now switch to a more difficult progression, and slowly lower yourself down. At the bottom of the movement and before you touch the floor (this is *one rep*), switch back to the easier progression and repeat the pull portion. Repeat for reps.

When you begin these you might not have the endurance to do multiple reps *without* touching the floor, but as you get stronger aim to do one full set without touching the floor (think: *time under tension*!). It's better to lower the progression so that you can do a full set than to push so hard that you have to touch the floor each rep.

E.g. If you can do *one-legged foot-to-knee*, use an *advanced tuck* for the pull portion, and experiment with either the *one-legged foot-to-knee* or the *straddle* for the negative.

**C. FL rows**

I'm sure these go without much explanation. Get into an easier progression and perform rows (pulling yourself horizontally towards the bar).

E.g. If you can do *adv. tuck*, do a knees-to-chest tuck and row for reps.

\---

# Conclusions

Using this programming I was able to achieve the FFL for roughly 7-8s holds after a solid 3 months. This was no doubt compounded by my 4 months of entry-level calisthenics work prior to that, and then >15 years of general weightlifting experience before that.

Did I take **Deload weeks**? Technically no; however although they weren't explicitly programmed into my schedule, I would often take extra rest days when I felt I needed them, or when I was too busy to work out.

Do I think this is **replicable**? Yes, definitely. I feel like it covered everything I needed to achieve the FL: from the static holds, to the hypertrophic/endurance component. But of course, everyone is built differently and everyone has different backgrounds, so please adjust it to your needs.

**To conclude**, I hope that was of some help to those of you working towards your FL. It took me a while to type all this up, but I'm glad I did it: my way of giving back to the community. If anyone has any questions feel free to comment below or DM me, and I'll do my best to respond. Life is quite busy atm, so I might be a little delayed. Thanks for reading!

Bodyweight for kid minimalist routine,Patlafauche,530,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gqwwfn/bodyweight_for_kid_minimalist_routine/,1590499132.0,"Hi,

I have two kids (7 and 10 years old) that are a lot involved in sport (hockey, soccer and for fun at home baseball, basketball). With the covid-19 we start to run and do bodyweight to keep being active.

Right now we do 1 or 2 time per week sprint (8 minutes Hiit 10 sec/30 sec) and one time cardio (5km).

For the bodyweight we do 5 time per week:

2x Push up

2x Ring Pull up

2x Abs (many exercice from situp, V-up, abs twist ect...)

2x Legs (Squat one and half, Jump Lunge, Jump Squat, 1 squat 2 lunges, Skater squat ect...)

&#x200B;

It only take 8-9 minutes per morning for the bodyweight routine. We don't push a lot on intensity because I think the habit and submaximal training is a lot better for this age.

Within 2 months, my son was doing one pullup and now is doing 6 clean one. My daugther pass 5 ugly pushup to 8 clean one.

What do you think about this, should I add anything or change anything? i was thinking of doing a sort of upper/lower training but I think if i push them to much they will just quit (6 series for leg instead of two take a toll on the moral).

Please give me your opinion but without bashing things like ""let them be kid"" and ""kid should not train"" ect... Athlete are driving crazy right now."
"The hardest unweighted leg movements compiled into a video, and examined in this post",RockRaiders,525,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/busb4u/the_hardest_unweighted_leg_movements_compiled/,1559217806.0,"#**[THE VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5293WLDg_nk)**

**The post came out a bit long (as usual), so you can skip to the sections you are interested in, or just watch the video to see some awesome moves.**

If I missed any movements requiring more strength to weight ratio, me or someone else can put them into future videos. If you have suggestions or want to share your experience with advanced leg calisthenics let me know. But any relevant and constructive comment is welcome.

Some of these exercises are useful for various purposes, and can be integrated with weighted training for the best results, others are only an expression of strength rather than a practical way to develop it.

In the future I want to make a detailed guide for minimalist leg training, I'm not satisfied with my older posts.

Contents of this post: general information (leverage, safety, misconceptions), the movements (examining each of the video's moves), difficulty comparison (ignoring practicality, only which moves are harder), training considerations (practicality for some goals).

**GENERAL INFORMATION**

* Most of these are quad or hamstring dominant, and the difficulty comes from lengthening the lever. A straight body and arms fully extended overhead maximize it, fully bent hips and arms by the sides minimize it.
* In the freestanding/free hanging moves the longest lever is with a horizontal shin, and depending on the body's lean and positioning of the arms and feet, full knee bend is near that point, or below (can be even below floor height, [image example](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lrhFHopwFIU/hqdefault.jpg)). 
* In anchored exercises the longest lever is with the body parallel to the floor, and the angle at which the shin is anchored can be varied ([image](https://i.imgur.com/uyf1eXA.jpg)). The hardest point also depends on the muscle [length-tension relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction#Length-tension_relationship) (muscles are weaker when not at their resting length, [another chart](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128132968000025-f02-23-9780128132968.jpg?_)).
* Another way of adding difficulty is using the friction between the clothing and a surface. More friction means an easier eccentric and harder concentric, and coming up from a static position is harder because of having to overcome static friction (and not using the stretch reflex, like in any other paused exercise). It's the only way I've seen that gives an advanced challenge for the glutes (but in a movement where the quads are probably the limiting factor).
* A principle for safe progress is never working through pain during the exercises, and if pain comes on rest days the intensity or total volume of each workout needs to be reduced. This applies mostly to leg extension variations since they are more stressful on the knee because of the shearing forces, while I rarely hear of problems with leg curls.
* In addition to that principle, things to avoid are knee valgus (knee caving in instead of being oriented towards the middle toes) and applying high impulses at 90° knee flexion (by decelerating or reversing direction quickly), especially when the load and instability are higher. [Relevant comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/87e8vm/new_amazing_leg_exercise_by_matteo_spinazzola/dwdyqyw/) by Joshua Naterman. 
* ~~This conversation with Naterman has more advice~~ EDIT: I should not have shared that private conversation, I'm an asshole. Instead refer to [his comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/busb4u/the_hardest_unweighted_leg_movements_compiled/epk956b/): the moves that put the knee under more instability with heavy loads are more risky the bigger and heavier you are, since ligaments don't scale well with size, and high stability is needed for the best strength and muscle gains, while you can train the unstable moves specifically if they are a goal of their own but they give less gains. Also a combination of weighted and bodyweight moves is needed for optimal results.
* Ben Patrick ([new IG account](https://www.instagram.com/kneesovertoesguy/)) built up to freestanding reps to a horizontal shin and recommends them if reached pain-free (I had a good post to link but his old account was hacked and deleted), and over some years he went from knee surgery to that level by progressing exercises like the sissy squat (and proving wrong people like Jeff Cavaliere who claim it's is the worst leg exercise).

**THE MOVEMENTS**

**Quad dominant**

* 0:04 - *One leg hindu squat with backward lean at the bottom*, which gets the shin below horizontal, although in a part where the hamstring is supported by the calf.
* 0:20 - *Elevated advanced/two hand shrimp squat* - the free leg and arms behind the center mass make the knee travel forward, with an almost horizontal shin, but they can't be used for balance. 
* 0:43 and 0:53 - *Elevated Matrix squat*, longer lever arm than sissy squats and around the difficulty of a pistol squat with 50% of my weight as added load for me, I haven't seen others try so I don't know if it's really that hard.
* 0:58 - *One leg extension lever hold, not perfect* (needs a shorter name, maybe *quad lever*). The free leg rests on the bench, making balance not a problem.
* 1:12 - I don't know how to call it, it's like an *absurd sissy squat/deep standing back bend*. The range comes from a lot of hip internal rotation and adduction and spinal extension. I've never seen anything close and don't know the difficulty.
* 1:40, 1:50, 3:20, 3:29, 4:09, 4:22 - *One leg sissy squat partials, negatives and full concentrics with bent hips*. I haven't seen anyone do a clean concentric from the floor for now, but the full negatives and clean reps from a horizontal shin position are very impressive. Somewhat challenging for balance.
* 1:58, 2:21, 3:10 - *One leg Matrix squat to horizontal position*. Hard to balance unless the setup supports the shin well, with full knee flexion it would probably be the hardest quad move.
* 2:44 - *Kneeling/natural one leg extension*, can be awkward to balance and one of the hardest quad moves according to Matteo Spinazzola who did those reps. The form looks like it could be improved.

**Hamstring dominant**

* 0:35, 1:47, 2:31 - *Inverted Nordic curls to almost 90° knee flexion*. The safest setups I know are on stall bars with inversion boots or 2 straps + carabinier. Hard to get good range without explosiveness, and pausing at the top is even harder. With two legs full knee flexion would be amazing, with one leg it would be the hardest hamstring move I think.
* 0:50, 2:13 - *One leg Nordic curl with the second knee eliminating balance problems*, very hard and I haven't seen perfect form with the body always straight.
* 1:04, 2:41, 3:04 - *Inverted pistol squat*. I got to around 90° knee flexion while Stefano Ravarino almost full range, he used a hand on a pole to stabilize himself but I doubt I could match his range even if I assisted myself. 
* 4:02, 4:33 - *Unsupported one leg Nordic curls*, requiring more strength and some balance since the other knee provides no stability. Form could be better, but already amazing. Second clip is sped up.

**Friction resisted**

* 3:51 - *Elevated natural one leg press*, the only exercise that can require advanced glute strength, although probably the quads work a bit more, difficulty proportional to the friction of the surface, on that plywood the non elevated version is like a pistol squat with 75% of bodyweight as added load according to Matteo.
* 0:16 - *Side splits to standing*, mainly uses the adductors, a smooth surface is needed to slide well. I don't know if it's actually very hard, but I was not able to find other videos of this. It could be done on rings too, even from oversplits, so more range but maybe less load?

**DIFFICULTY COMPARISON**

* The quads are generally stronger than hamstrings, so if the lever arm and knee angle are the same, quad exercises should be harder than hamstring ones. For example Stefano Ravarino can do an imperfect one leg extension lever hold, but can't do an imperfect one leg Nordic curl. And Matrix squats to horizontal are easier than Nordic curls. The only exception I know is Matteo Spinazzola doing more one leg Nordic curls (13) than one leg Matrix squats to horizontal (3), but he started training the second exercise much later, and maybe now it's easier for him. 
* At full knee flexion it's the same: I did the elevated Matrix squat but can only get 90° range in stall bars inverted Nordic curls, and in the free hanging version too (inverted sissy squat, [image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kSpahFUIK7U/hqdefault.jpg), the counterpart of the deep sissy squat, which I can do for reps).
* Assuming the same range, from easier to harder: sissy squats, Matrix squats, leg extension lever raise. Seems to apply for one leg, since in that case the sissy at 90° knee is not very hard and the lever shorter than in the Matrix, which 3 people have held at 90°, and in the one leg lever nobody has held a fully horizontal body, where the quads would be fully shortened, with worse length-tension than the 90° knee of sissy and Matrix.
* In end range exercises we have one example of the kneeling/natural one leg extension for reps, but nobody doing the bottom part of the one leg sissy, or one leg Matrix which I expect to be the hardest. For two legs in my experience the order of difficulty is the same.
* With the same range stall bars inverted Nordic curls are harder than inverted pistol squats and floor Nordic curls, since in the first move nobody was able to pause at the top. Also full knee flexion will probably be hard to reach without momentum, since hamstring compression strength requires specific training.

It would be cool to determine what level these moves would be in the [Overcoming Gravity charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/). My first attempt (probably with inaccuracies) of ranking them would be:

* Level 4: pistol squat.
* Level 5: sissy squat knees to floor, kneeling leg extension, Matrix squat to 90°.
* Level 6: Nordic curl, leg extension lever, natural one leg press on easiest friction surfaces, one leg sissy squat to 90°, inverted sissy squat to 90°.
* Level 7: elevated Matrix squat, inverted Nordic curl to 90° on stall bars (no pause at the top), inverted pistol squat to 90°, one leg Matrix squat to 90°, elevated two hand shrimp squat on toes.
* Level 8: inverted pistol squat full range, kneeling one leg extension, natural one leg press on plywood, one leg extension lever with good form.
* Level 9: one leg sissy squat to horizontal shin.
* Level 10: one leg Nordic curl (second knee on the floor).
* Level 11: one leg Nordic curl (second knee unsupported), elevated one leg press on plywood.
* ???: inverted one leg Nordic curl, elevated one leg sissy squat, elevated one leg Matrix squat, maybe more elevated one leg press.

**TRAINING CONSIDERATIONS**

* If you can, add weight (even improvised such as people, rocks, logs, bags of stuff) to basic exercises (squats/deadlifts/hip thrusts/split squats/lunges, or unilateral versions if not much weight is available). Some hard unweighted moves are still useful, even on their own.
* For muscle mass a full range and no instability is better, and it might be harder to get a lot of volume for the quads until the knees are robust enough. It could work since the bodybuilder Julian Smith uses a lot of leg extension variations and weighted sissy squats.
* Strength is specific to the range of motion used, so you can choose full range, or around 90° depending on your goals, and whether you need to overload the stretched or contracted range.
* The most practical leg curl is the Nordic since it's simple to set up (best options are plank or bench or even pole/tree + strap or heels under something immovable like a car or furniture etc.), and one leg with the other knee down requires high strength and no balance. Some benefits are prevention of hamstring strains and more running and jumping power. [Post with many setups and progressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/88cvqe/the_nordic_curl_the_ultimate_hamstring_bodyweight/). 
* I don't know if floor Nordics carry over well to the top part of inverted pistol squats and inverted Nordic curls and what are the benefits/applications of overloading that range close to full contraction. 
* One leg sissy squats require no equipment (or just something to hold for balance if you don't trust the instability under load), so they are the simplest option and should carry over to all the other quad exercises. Sissy squat progressions are used by a growing number of athletes to bulletproof the knees, and you might have noticed that Ben Patrick is their biggest fan, but he's not the first or only coach promoting them. 
* The one leg extension lever overloads the range near lock out, I don't know if this has practical applications, maybe kicking, but I think it can be gained indirectly, since I got the two leg version without training it thanks to sissy and Matrix squats.
* Friction moves like the one leg press (wall pistol squat) can be useful because they are hard but require low balance, and no need to elevate the foot for general strength. [Naterman's advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/87e8vm/new_amazing_leg_exercise_by_matteo_spinazzola/dwcxrjq/). I don't know if they include a practical way of isolating the glutes. For hamstrings sliding one leg curls are also useful (could be done at a decline, or fully inverted, like an upside down sissy squat against a door ([image of possible but not very practical setup](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9_hVf3rCLTI/hqdefault.jpg), could be done one legged with extended hips), could be harder than stall bars one leg inverted Nordics). Wall sissy squats ([90° image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTi4Ed1_djw/hqdefault.jpg)) are easy to balance, even with one leg ([90° image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xyxgMIhjn5s/hqdefault.jpg)) (which done full range with high friction could be harder than elevated one leg Matrix squats).

Hey guys and gals, Nick-E here.

You might know me from the official BWF discord channel where I spend far too much time, or you might also remember me (unlikely) from 2016 when I used to actually post more! If you use the app, I'm also the guy who did all the demos for the strength work, and for molding mobility!

This time I've written a guide about something that I commonly end up recommending to inquirers on the discord chat for a variety of reasons:

* Help learn bracing for better bodyline or when beginning weightlifting

* Help to learn how to breathe while maintaining tension (very useful for the handstand)

* Improve core contraction

* Regress to improve form on Hollow Holds

It was becoming fairly cumbersome to keep explaining it over and over so I figured it would be prudent to have a place where it was neatly written down with some pictures and gifs to go along with it, and since that's what I made my site for to begin with, it made sense to start writing in article form again!

Hope you like it! If you have any questions at all or wanna poke my brain please feel free to either comment on here or drop me a line with the tag @Nick-E on the discord channel (found here: www.Discord.gg/BWF) as I tend to check it most days."

Minimalists unite! What's your minimalist routine?,Won_Doe,530,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/rrfj5u/minimalists_unite_whats_your_minimalist_routine/,1640803989.0,"I'm a firm believer of ""mental sustainability"" for long-term success; so many people go through a ""beastmode"" phase of their lives where they hit the gym/workouts hard, to the max, then ultimately just burnout. Seeing an extended laundry list of movements in a routine is such a turnoff for me. Considering the large of muscles compound movements hit, I never felt it necessary to have such a long list. My own:

- **Chinups**:  Narrow-grip/hollowbody. I've completely stopped doing pullups in favor of chins. At the very last rep of a set, I hold at the very top to allow the biceps/core put in some extra work. Try it! They also build some pretty awesome abs. 

- **Dips**: Often with 35lbs between the legs. It's fun knowing that my pecs which I've been complimented on in a few occasions were built using my mom's plastic medical walker. It sits in my room since it takes up practically no space so I can crank out some reps on a complete whim; convenient, amazing.

- **Legs**: Got me here. I'm lazy in this department. Sometimes it's goblet squats, air squats, BSS. Finally mastering the pistol squat so this may be my new lazy movement here, in between my occasional hikes.

- **ETC**: Kettlebells. Walmart had some on the cheap earlier in the year so I'll occasionally do a few cleans/rows, whatever. Just some random spontaneous movements for functional strength building. 

That's pretty much it. Not the most exciting routine but it keeps me consistent for sure."

My result is pretty good (the link to the video is attached below), but I think that you can get a better result for the same time, if you will not repeat my mistakes and will follow my right actions. I was pretty good with pull ups, I was able to do 11 pull-ups, and I expected that I will be able to do altleast 1 muscle up after 10 days of training. Unfortunatly fora first muscle up I needed 18 days and I needed 34 days for 2 good muscle ups in a row !

I had a goal with a 10 days deadline in my head.I put some pressure on my self and I stayed consistent and focused and try to train everyday! I watched a lot videos, but every time when I was re-watching during my training days I found something new and helpful.

I tracked my progress on the video, that was a right decision and helped me to find me my mistake. My grip was not wide enough. As soon as I fixed it, I felt progress. At this moment it gave me an idea to make a video with my tracking way to muscle up. It helped me and I really think it will help you! I was focused on my regularity of training. Each workout I tried to do as many sets as my shoulder joints were able to do. I always allowed myself to relax a few minutes between sets, but anyway usually I was working out over pain. I tried to train every day, but I was getting  better progress when I spend 1-2 days to restore for my muscle and shoulder joints.

After 7 days of training I was able to do a chicken wing muscle-ups. It was difficult and looked bad, it was really painful for my shoulder joints, but defently it was a progress. I started to swing more, do slow negative muscle ups and try to do muscle ups with a jump. It also helped and after 10 days more of training and pain I was able to do a muscle up. Corn pain was awful!  Finger patches made it a bit easy for me! pain affects progress!  Training gloves can help you! Negative muscle ups help a lot to. Try to do negative transition part as slow as posssible. Swinging before a muscle up. It will help you a lot. When your muscle memory will understand what to do and body will be enought strong, you will be able to start to do muscle ups without swinging.

&#x200B;

**I was working hard on it but something helped me more:**

* \- wide grip
* \- slow negative muscle ups
* \- swinging
* \- explosive pull ups
* \- 1-2 days for rest and recover after a training day

&#x200B;

I was happy. It is so good to feel a progress. Worth it! I felt that the muscle up was perfect, but I watched a video and I saw that a left (weak) hand had a slight delay. I thought that the next days will be easy and I will do a perfect muscle up in 3 days, but that was a mistake. Next days I wasn't able to repeat a muscle up. I continued to practice, I was feeling that my body was becoming stronger and I knew that the day is comming. I took few days to relax to my body and in 34 days from beggining I did two perfect muscle ups in a row. After that I was able to do a muscle up at any time. My muscle memory just has it! I was still swinging before a muscle up, but not too much already and I felt that soon I will be able to Muscle ups with out swinging.

**My history of results:**

* Day 1: 11 pull ups
* Day 7: First ""chicken wing"" Muscle UP
* Day 18: First muscle up with a little in 1 hand
* Day 34: Two muscle UPs in a row
* Day 37: 16 pull ups

I tried overdo myself, but practice showed me that it is a bad idea.  **That is only way to finally do a muscle up:** ***Practice, rest, practice, rest, and again..***

Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps for those that are still learning.

Just keep practice and give the muscles time to recover and rest and sooner or later you will be able to muscle up. If I.. a skinny guy did it, anyone can do it :D

A lot of them ask about losing weight (or other non exclusive topics) for example, which does not belong here. On the other hand if I make a post related to calisthenics (for example I made a post about my Full Planche, asking detailed questions a while ago) it gets deleted and I am told to post in the discussion thread, which is kind of pointless because you will never get the same engagement of users and multiple opinions compared to making your own post.

I don’t know if this is seen as an issue for those strictly committed to calisthenics here, but if it is, a way to fix it in my opinion would be to rename the sub to something more specific, e.g. „calisthenics“."

I've been doing Bodyweight Fitness for 16 months and I moved a barbell around for the first time last night. Here's what I thought.,ImChrisBrown,527,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3l8sqb/ive_been_doing_bodyweight_fitness_for_16_months/,1442451201.0,"I post occasionally here and I'm a huge supporter of the recommended routine to everyone. For a bit more on me [here's my 1-year progress post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/37vvdm/progress_ive_been_doing_the_recommended_routine/). 

[Here's my latest shirtless selfie](http://imgur.com/6AwVC5o) I took yesterday. The lighting's not that good. I'm 26, 168lbs and 6'

I usually deload every 4th week as I seem to accumulate fatigue and my work ethic drops off. Yesterdays workout started my 6th week of this mesocycle which I intended for hypertrophy (lots more volume than I normally do). I likely have acquired more fatigue than I am normally used to and my performance during yesterdays lifting session was probably affected.

I never move iron around. My life is crazy and hectic and I move often and travel often. The reason I've been so adament about BWF training is that I can do it anywhere and that its scale-able for everyone. On top of that I've acquired some really sweet skills and I'm able to workout anywhere I like. This summer I ran my program [outside in the forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS_Alh6DfK8) and got two friends to join me to workout in the woods. On Friday (sept 18th) I fly to Bangkok and I'll be in South East Asia til Nov 24th. I'll be traveling the region for 69 days. I'm taking my olympic rings and plan on increasing my strength as I travel half a dozen countries. Gym's and iron just don't work for me unfortunately.



I hung out with a friend last night and asked him to run me through his barbell programming. He has a simple [rack](http://www.amazon.com/Barbell-Power-Rack-Exercise-Stand/dp/B00HYQP72O/ref=sr_1_2?s=exercise-and-fitness&ie=UTF8&qid=1442448468&sr=1-2&keywords=power+rack) in his garage with a barbell, some bumper plates (45lbs, 25lbs and 10lbs) and a couple 10 and 25lb iron plates. He started lifting again two months ago after a long hiatus. He's lifting beginner numbers and is seeing linear progress in all his lefts every session (or nearly every session)

It was his ""A"" day and we were just doing three compounds. Squat, Benchpress & Row. He's looking for more volume than just 5x5 so he just moved his programming to 4x8. Rows he only does 3x5.

I've never squatted before. I snowboard often in the winter and hike a fair bit during the summer. I can do 3x8 pistol squats on each leg.

I squatted 135 for 8 reps and it felt light. I did 3x8x135 and on my 4th set i squatted 155lbs for 8 reps. Barspeed slowed down considerably my last couple reps and it felt heavy. It was really, really freaking nice to feel quad, hamstring and glute activation. Holy crap, squats are fantastic. I wish it was more reasonable to squat more often. I really enjoyed it.

I bench pressed in Highschool and remember when I started just the bar was heavy. I couldnt believe that the bar was only 45lbs and I was having trouble lifting it. Through absolutely terrible programming I somehow was able to 1rm 135lbs before the end of my highschool career. I stopped lifting shortly after I graduated and I lost most my strength.

I thought 135 would be too light to start out so I benched 155lbs for 8 reps for my first set. No warmup. No practice with the bar. It felt heavy the last couple reps and my bar speed slowed down. I continued to finish with 3x8x135lbs. [exrx.net](http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax.html) puts my 1rm benchpress at 192lbs, which I'm happy with.

The bar felt weird. It wobbled around a bit. Stabilizing it was interesting. My pec's werent firing at the same time and sometimes one side would come down or go up quicker. It moved around laterally in space a fair bit. It felt so obscure to have a loaded bar above me.

The most significant thing I remember thinking while I was working through the benchpress sets is that the bar stays loaded. A lot of time in BWF the degree in difficulty comes from the angle or the leverage we choose to do the exercise at, thus, its pretty damn easy to cheat ourselves. It's easy to decrease lean while in PPPU for the last couple of reps. It's easy to not RTO dips when intending to do RTO dips. A lot of times you can change the load as a matter of preference/lack of will. With a loaded bar the load never changes. That 155 that I moved for the first rep was the same 155 I moved for my 8th rep. It was an interesting aspect I hadn't thought about.

I thought since I can hold RTO Support for 45 seconds, do 3 freestanding HeSPU's, do 4x8 RTO dips, 6 ring muscle ups, and several bar muscle ups that my 'stabilizer' muscles would be fine when in bench press. That the bar would stay still and solid and that I'd only be moving it vertically. I was wrong. I don't think it's due to a weakness I think it's due to the SAID Principle (Specific Adapation to Implied Demand). We get good at what we train and I hadn't trained this lift in 7 years.

We did rows at 110lbs for 3sets of 5reps. My pullups are dope. I was just recently working 4x10+30lbs in a backpack for pullups. Before we started lifting I showed my buddy my progress on my front lever. Having to ground the feet into the earth to do a pull was such a weird freaking sensation. I'm so used to have my feet be a nonissue in pull but I nearly made myself fall over the first couple of reps because I wasn't grounding down. Rows were pretty easy and the only noticeable thing I got out of them was that I had to ground my feet. My back felt great. I really liked the activation going on.

*All in all I enjoyed it.* There's value in doing things you never do. You become less ignorant by learning more and last night I learned more. I learned about myself and I learned about the barbell. During the winter it may become more accessible for me to utilize the barbell consistently. I'd like to squat but I'll probably save my legs for snowboarding. I'll probably benchpress since I feel my chest is always lacking and I'd like to see what other benefits barbell training could offer.

Have you introduced barbell training into your bwf routine?

With some exercises I don't feel the muscles that I should working, pull ups is one.

My back muscles such as my lats don't seem to turn on when I'm doing pull ups. My biceps get a good workout alright but not my back.

Today I did dumbbell shrugs and it's the first time I've felt my traps actually work whereas when I do pull ups I don't feel a thing!

So here's the thing, my back has never really being put to use, it's my most neglected chain.

So I'm thinking that my brain just has no idea on how to use the muscles because there not used enough.

Im now convinced that mind muscle connection must be a real thing. 

Any tips on how to solve this?

Edit
So thank you for the replies, I’ve learned that mind muscle connection is real and when doing pull ups try to drive your elbows inward as this uses your lats more along with doing slow reps."

I joined this platform roughly 2 months ago and answered a bunch of question since then. Each of us is on their own journey and it's super inspiring to see success stories and motivational content, but also very interesting to see the everyday struggles of most *Redditors*. It made me realize that a lot of people don't know what things like **Range of Motion**, **Time under Tension**, **Deload** or other terms are. 

That's why I decided to create a video which gives you an overview of different terms that are often used in bodyweight strength training. On top of that, it contains some concepts which you might not were aware of and which you can use for your own training (e.g. Mechanical Advantage Sets to overcome plateaus). 

**At least for me, I would have benefitted a lot from this when I was younger and new/beginner to bodyweight strength training. Although mistakes and failures are needed, we all have the desire to make progress in the most efficient way possible.** I also tried to add some practical examples from my own training to some of the chapters for reasons of understanding.

**Content:**

*  Range of Motion
*  Repetition
*  Seconds
*  Sets
*  Time under Tension 
*  Tempo 
*  Concentric, Eccentric, Isometric 
*  Deload 
*  Bilateral & Unilateral 
*  Frequency 
*  Volume 
*  Intensity
*  Plateau 
*  Accumulating Concept
*  Mechanical Advantage Set 
*  Cluster Sets 
*  Agonist & Antagonist Super Set 
*  Micro-, Meso- and Macrocycle

Please keep in mind that this video is by no means comprehensive, it outlines some of the things that I think are important to know. In the world of TikTok, Instagram Reels and more, I believe that sharing value is more important than ever. This is not a bullshit video and I genuinely hope that this will help some of you guys with your own training and training progress.

After creating the video I realized that the [Concept Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/weekly/conceptwednesday) exists. But nevertheless, this subreddit covers some of the things in a much more in-depth way, and I think that sometimes a visual representation is much more appealing.

I used to do them in the 100's every single day and noticed a change pretty fast, and because of this my chest has stayed the same for pretty much my entire life. For me lifting weights has caused me to see a bit of an extra gain but pushups have really created that strong base I have been looking for.

Beginner and what's to start with Calisthenics?,FlefilDaniel,520,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fgf0f3/beginner_and_whats_to_start_with_calisthenics/,1583851989.0,"IF you are a beginner and wanna start with calisthenics, no matter if you are 100 kg or 40 kg, there is a lvl for everybody. But let's not hide the truth that if you are lighter you will have it easier to pull yourself up later down the road... Gravity you know...

Here are some tips for you who wanna start with calisthenics training:

1. Set realistic goals, don't aim for a muscle-up within 1 month if you are not even able to do one clean pull up. Start building that strength in the basics like, pushups, dips, pull ups, toes to bar and more. I would say take one your to build a good base of strength. This will help you progress later on to harder skills, it is worth it!
2. Listen to people that know about training and working out and not just an influencer with a lot of followers. If somebody says ""THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT"" then you should stop listening. What I mean by that is, if somebody says this is the only way to learn the front lever, my way and says that you should be able to learn front lever within 3-6 months and say that to everybody no matter what height, weight, etc.... then there is missing some knowledge.  It will be harder for tall and heavy people to learn static elements and can take up to 2-3 years before reaching them. But a person that is 50-60 kg will be able to learn the skills much faster because of the height and weight. BUT THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE, I hear this very often ""I AM TO TALL"" stop complaining and work for it if you want it.
3. Nutrien will help you tremendously to progress faster. Food is your fuel if you feed yourself with shitty food and skip the basics of eating that you need, Carbs, protein, fat. It might take longer for you to have the skills you want if you don't think about this. Eat your Carbs, eat your protein, eat your fats... A GOOD way to know what you eat is the app LIFESUM, download it, because it is free as well if you don't need the premium version.

This was my 2 cents for today

How do you convince people that they should exercise?,cmprogrammers,520,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cxzg7a/how_do_you_convince_people_that_they_should/,1567278672.0,"Hi,

I talked to a gym owner yesterday. He said that most of the time it does not matter the quality of the workout you design for the client because in the end if he does not have enough incentives to follow it, he simply won't. Therefore those people usually will not do anything on their own, even if you give them the best app/service that they ask. You can just try to encourage/motivate them as best as you can and advice them to be consistent over time.

I personally struggle to go more than two days without training, and I know many people like me that, after they start training consistently for some time, cannot do without it anymore. I know many people and friends that are overweight and have an unhealthy lifestyle, and when they ask for advice I immediately try to help them to start training. I share with them all my equipment, all my knowledge and I follow them at my best. Nonetheless, in the end nearly everyone leaves after just one session.

I would love to help the people that are close to me to feel better, and I do not personally see any better incentive than feeling better and being healthy every day of your life.

How do you go about introducing people to fitness in such a way that they become consistent enough to feel better? What do you think can incentivize people to stick more than one session? Do you believe that in the end it is all about every single person's mentality or it is possible to do something about it?"
My Story,None,515,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/n5ybiv/my_story/,1620272339.0,"Hello everyone. So I guess today I have finally decided I should share my story to the world. I have been on quite the fitness journey over the past couple years. It started spring 2019. I weighed 320 pounds and I am 5’11”.  I had been obese my whole life. One day I just had a switch go off in my head that I wanted to change my life for the better and shoot for everything I wanted in my life. I wanted to lose weight and be fit. I just want people to take my story as motivation to shoot for the stars. Never think something is impossible. 

So I began just generally eating less and healthier. No second servings and no junk food like cookies and cupcakes and ice cream and chips. I started eating healthier snacks like fruits and pretzels. 

Most importantly I started counting calories. I downloaded an app called MyFitnessPal. I’m not claiming it to be 100% accurate but it did an excellent job at keeping me counting my calories consistently that led me to reach the results I was seeking.  
I believe I was eating around 2000 to 2500 calories when I first started the amount of calories I could eat decreased as I got closer and closer to my goal. My goal was to lose 2 pounds a week and to weigh 200 pounds.  My final calorie intake was around 1500 before I hit my goal. And even tho the scale didn’t show 2 pounds lost every week all the time, I consistently did lose weight. 

I hit my goal of 200 pounds summer of 2020. Around halfway through my journey I also started to do light cardio. I would take light walks of 30 minutes to an hour each day. As I got more fit I started to run and do body weight exercises like sit-ups and planks and jumping jacks. 

Eventually when I hit my goal, I invested in weights and resistance bands and started to weight training. My current goals now are to build muscle and get stronger. I currently follow a personal workout routine but if anyone’s curious it’s a Push/Pull/Leg 3 day split I do twice a week, and rest on Sunday. I currently train at a gym. 

This leads me now to probably the most inspirational part of my journey. My weight loss inspired my family to start losing weight. They started walking and eating healthier. My mom, sister, and brother lost over 200 pounds combined. We vacationed to universal studios Orlando in the fall and my mom was able to fit in rides she never was able to before. My family thanks me and tells me I saved our lives. We were all obese and leading very unhealthy lives. 

The craziest thing that happened was probably a month ago when me and my mom were on the way to the gym and walking out to the car. I worked outside with weights and resistance bands in the summer after I hit my goal and I live in a apartment complex so a lot of people saw me (btw I got so many compliments and I cannot thank my community enough). Anyway we saw a man walking and he was using a workout equipment (I have no idea what the thing was). He stopped me and my mom and told us that he would watch us exercise everyday in the summer and we inspired him to start exercising. 

So there it is. There’s my story. But in truth my journey just has begun. I’m still year 1 in gym and am striving to get muscular. I just really want or at least hope that people can take my story as the people around me have as motivation to not just reach any fitness goals you have, but any goals you have in general. Never give up.

Here is some before and after pictures of me. I’m not comfortable sharing pictures of my family although I do have one before and after of me and my mom.

**Day 0** (before starting any workout in general)

- Ask ""How to get ripped abs?""
- Ask ""How do I get toned?"" 

// 30 days rest


**Day 31**

- Remember that you should start working out.

- Jump on the dip bars, shake your hands like you mean it then give up doing dips.
- Try to do rows under the table, but give up because the table has a bad angle. Must be, cause your grip strength is pretty solid from all the bags your carry from the store.


**Day 69**

- Watch the L-sit video from Antranik, cause youtube recommended it to you

- 2x5-8 squats, get fatigue

//Remember: don't rest!!

- Do a very shaky support hold for 15secs

**Day 121 because I lost count**

- Ask ""I've been doing the proper core work but I still can't see my abs, what do?""
- Read through the FAQ carefully
- Watch more videos from Antranik, Coach Sommer, GMB etc
- Read through some of the Concept and Technique threads
- Appreciate this community for taking all your bullshit and moronic questions and helping you
- Do proper research before doing anything.



Anyway, that's it. What did I forget? Is there any stuff that beginners usually do? I know most of these questions that get asked are already answered throughout this subreddit and the wiki. Even on google if not here. BTW, I was just doing something for the absolute beginners and one-time ""Ripped abs"" visitors, not the *active* community here. Don't mean any hate or negativity to either parties.




**tl;dr beginners still don't read the faq**

Actually releasing your upper traps!,None,507,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/r3hwbn/actually_releasing_your_upper_traps/,1638033008.0,"So I have been looking into upper traps release and stretches and the top recommendations on Youtube did nothing for me. I found a video someone linked here on reddit of someone doing a deep traps release by doing a wall handstand and supporting one side of his traps on a foam roller. It looked awesome, but as a beginner working on shoulder health and stability even trying a handstand seems a little too daring for me at the moment. So I was looking into alternatives and a came up with a simple method: find a wall [corner](https://www.123rf.com/photo_21691246_background-of-the-white-brick-wall-corner.html), get on all fours, gently press your traps on the corner and then bend over while maintaining your hip high to control the pressure and the release area. After doing that I felt an instant relief on my traps. See if it does anything for you. If you have a better method please share.

Quick tip for having perfect pseudo planche pushups,Patrick_Sponge,509,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g0v9is/quick_tip_for_having_perfect_pseudo_planche/,1586824344.0,"People always do pseudo planche pushups wrong, myself included. We normally start with a planche lean, go down, then push up into a non-lean position.

This approach is wrong (not entirely tho) because you are supposed to be on a planche lean all the time, and pushing up into a normal pushup position makes the push much easier.

***To avoid this*** you have to start in a pushup position with your feet pushed against the wall, and from there just move your hands to lean instead of leaning yourself forward. This way, ***when you try to push up you wont be able to break the lean because the wall wont let you.***

Heres a demonstration of the normal PPPUs and PPPUs with perfect form:

Routine for bulletproofing your ankles! Mobility + Strength,santiagopinzon,514,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/63gd9f/routine_for_bulletproofing_your_ankles_mobility/,1491333827.0,"Hello bw reedit :)

I wanted to share a routine I use for preventing injuries in my ankles. As I child I had very poor stability and I had two sprains in my left ankle but, since I've been doing this routine, I've never had problems again! 

VIDEO->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdtPHsyN_M

You can see the video or I'll leave the summary here:

2 times a week to everyday you may do this routine, which includes all movements of the ankles - dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion and eversion. It mixes stretches with strengthening exercises in ""vulnerable"" positions that, when trained progressively, can increase the resilience of your ankles. I usually do it in my warm up.

Here's how to do it:

A1. Dorsiflexion stretch with the knee going towards the middle of the foot ( http://imgur.com/CwriP7w ). Do 10 repetitions, followed by a 10 sec hold, both at the end range.

A2. Toe pointing ( http://imgur.com/gji1ILO ): Choose a progression that allows you to do it for 10 secs. It may be just putting minimal pressure on this position and helping yourself with the other leg or the hands, to standing on only one leg with the leg bend.

B1. Dorsiflexion stretch with the knee going towards the pinky ( http://imgur.com/DtYkkjx ): Do 10 repetitions, followed by a 10 sec hold, both at the end range.

B2. Outside ankle hold ( http://imgur.com/Dez5hfc ): Choose a progression that allows you to do it for 10 secs. It may be just putting minimal pressure on this position and helping yourself with the other leg or the hands, to standing on only one leg with the leg bend.

C1. Dorsiflexion stretch but the knee travels to the big toe ( http://imgur.com/Q8S8gYD ): Do 10 repetitions, followed by a 10 sec hold, both at the end range.

C2. Inside ankle hold ( http://imgur.com/1dY1Hs1 ): Choose a progression that allows you to do it for 10 secs. It may be just putting minimal pressure on this position and helping yourself with the other leg or the hands, to standing on only one leg with the leg bend.

You may add additional stretches/strengthening exercises for your arches, toes, calves and shin! As always, give yourself time to adapt to these positions and start easy. 

I hope this is helpful!"

FYI for beginners: Do NOT attempt to modify the Recommend Routine,eshlow,513,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/41wffd/fyi_for_beginners_do_not_attempt_to_modify_the/,1453324732.0,"There's recently been lots of posts on modifying the recommended routine. Let me share with you some thoughts and insights about doing this.

**Generally speaking, the recommend routine (and all of its previous incarnations) is a generalized routine that is well suited to beginners in order to build a sufficient base from which to train more advanced bodyweight movements.** 

There are several key words in this sentence, so let me talk about them specifically.

* **Generalized routine** -- a generalized routine is made for the generalized population as a whole. Much of the strength progresssions, mobility, and flexibility work are aimed specifically at correcting posture, imbalances, and other types of issues that you would see in the general population. This means that the RR is not geared toward those who have specific mastery with gymnastics skills or have other sports backgrounds. If you have one of those backgrounds, then there may be many things in the recommend routine that you don't need to do. 

For example, if you have impeccable body positioning from previous gymnastics experience you do not need to do the position drills (or bodyline drills as they're called in the recommended routine). They are specifically placed in the recommend routine in order that beginners learn how to maintain tension in their core and good positions during bodyweight exercises. Good positions during bodyweight exercises is important as progressions such as pushups rely on a straight body in order to maximize strength and technique. If you are able to hold perfect body positions during difficult and intense bodyweight exercises then you simply do not need to perform hollow or arch holds anymore because you have the sufficient experience and strength to do it perfectly already.

* **well suited to beginners** -- if you are more advanced in training then the recommended routine is not for you. Obviously, you can go back to if it you want to reinforce some of the basic fundamental movements. However, it is primarily suited for untrained or somewhat trained beginners in order to progress the basics of strength, body position, flexibility, and mobility. This means that if you already have sufficient experience in any of these areas this routine may be inefficient for you. 

Alternatively, if you are a beginner there is a reason that such things were placed into the routine. The previous example of position drills is exactly this point. Beginners need them and maybe intermediates. Those who are advanced simply do not need positional drills in their routines anymore unless they want them as they are a waste of time. Likewise, the pairing and balance of the exercises is another one. Trying to ""remove pullups"" or ""change exercises"" is simply not a good idea because they were placed in the routine specifically for a certain reason whether to maintain good posture, structural balance, or provide a solid strength foundation for your future training.

* **in order to build a sufficient base from which to train more advanced bodyweight movements** -- This is the most important part of the FYI in my opinion. Lots of the posts recently and in the past have to do with modifying the recommended routine for one thing or another.

While this is not necessarily a bad thing, there is a lot of training/sports science and years of coaching experience that went into creating the routine. Hence, modifying it out of its original incarnation tends to be an unwise thing to do if you are a beginner. 

The main issue of modification out of the original incarnation has to do with progress and results. Any time an inexperienced person modifies a set routine they willingly opt into a state of ""I know better than the person who designed this."" While it's true that such people who modify a routine can come away with superior results, the vast majority of time this is NOT the case and they come away with inferior or vastly inferior results or progress.

**Clarification**: Re: ""I know better than..."" There is reasoning behind many things in the recommend routine. We don't have any problems if someone is asking about reasoning behind certain exercises either. For example, with back lever it's unwise to jump straight into back lever. It's more important to realize that the RR recommendation of skin the cat/german hang, support holds, positional drills, and pullups and rows is building a foundation of strength and connective tissue integrity and positioning in order to prepare you for back lever. Most new people do not recognize why many of the exercises are programmed the way they are for higher level goals.

The problem, then, that this poses is for critique. If someone says they did the recommend routine then we can offer them suggestions to tailor it if they were having issues in a certain area. However, if they change the routine then we don't necessarily know where you might have screwed up because you already altered the final expected results by changing the routine. When you change the routine you also change the expected results. Hence, you have gone off own your own path of training alone without the combined experience of tens of thousands of people who have gone before you who can monitor your progress and help you along.

This is one of the major factors that inhibit a lot of progress of beginners who want to do their own thing rather than stick to the program. This is seen not just with the recommend routine but also within any type of beginner program such as Starting Strength, StrongLifts, or individual sports or disciplines like martial arts, gymnastics, or whatever. If you deviate from what the coaches that have experiences are saying then it makes it very hard to figure out what you're doing wrong or what you may need to change if you unexpectedly plateau or stagnate in your training.

**TL;DR Thus, do not modify the recommend routine if at all possible if you are a beginner. Two exceptions:**

* Injury concerns. If this is the case, talk to a medical or rehab professional about what you should be doing instead of some exercises.
* Other sports or discipline background. You may need to decrease the frequency or adjust your schedule or the routine if you are training for another sport because the routine ceases to become ""stand alone"" and is instead part of a ""program geared at improving performance""

**edit:** Re: ""nazi-ish."" This post is a GENERAL RECOMMENDATION just as the RR is a generalized routine. Of course there will be some exceptions such as highly specific goals, injuries, sports backgrounds, and the like. If you think you have an exception then ask a question. "

Recent study shows that JUST ONE SET PER MUSCLE GROUP is enough to build strength,pranjayv,512,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9h5d8x/recent_study_shows_that_just_one_set_per_muscle/,1537365447.0,"Since I am injured right now and I have all the time in the world to read studies and other stuff like that, today I present you [a very interesting study recently published by Schoenfeld and colleagues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194) which shows that there are some benefits (as far as only strength is concerned) by doing just one set of exercise per muscle group. This study can be helpful for busy individuals who do not have too much time to work out. Sure that 3-5 sets per muscle group 2-3 times a week is the most optimal way to train for most goals like strength or hypertrophy but according to this study, just 1 set of exercise is enough to atleast maintain and potentially even build strength.

For those who like to watch a video rather than reading, I recommend watching [this video by PictureFit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKGooCndn80).

# ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study was to evaluate muscular adaptations, i.e. muscular strength, muscular hypertrophy and muscular endurance between low-, moderate-, and high-volume resistance training protocols in resistance-trained men over a period of 8 weeks.

# METHODS

* 34 healthy college-aged men with at least one year of training experience were selected and were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups.
* All the 3 groups did 3 full body workouts a week on non consecutive days and did the same exercises.
* The low volume group contained 11 individuals and were assigned 1 set per exercise per training session.
* The medium volume group contained 12 individuals and were assigned 3 sets per exercise per training session.
* The high volume group contained 11 individuals and were assigned 5 sets per exercise per training session.
* Each one of them did 7 exercises - cable row, military press, lat pulldown, back squat, machine leg press, flat bench press and leg extensions using a load that put them into the 8-12 rep range and every set was taken to concentric failure.
* Muscular strength was evaluated with 1 rep max testing for the squat and bench press.
* Upper-body muscle endurance was evaluated using 50% of subjects bench press 1 rep max performed to momentary failure.
* Muscle hypertrophy was evaluated using B-mode ultrasonography for the elbow flexors, elbow extensors, mid-thigh and lateral thigh.

# RESULTS

* At an average, the high volume workout took about an hour to complete, the medium volume workout took about 40 minutes and the low volume workout took less than 15 minutes to complete.
* Obviously, hypertrophy was seen the most in the high volume group and the least in the low volume group.
* Also similar muscular endurance gains were noticed in all the groups as 8-12 rep range does not build too much endurance. Again not any surprising results.
* But the biggest surprising results were in the case of strength gains. Subjects from all three groups had almost similar improvements in their bench press and back squat 1 rep max.

# APPLICATIONS

* If you are an experienced resistance trained man, you might be able to build some strength with just one set per exercise by spending just 15 minutes in the gym.
* If you have suddenly become very busy because of some unavoidable commitments like work, exams, babies, overly attached girl/boyfriend etc., you can still build some strength or atleast maintain it.
* For the people who say that they do not work out because they do not have the time to do so - understand that this excuse would not work now. Everyone can sneak out 15 minutes (just 1% of the total time in a day) for self improvement. Instead of laying on your bed and scrolling through Instagram, devote that time to work out.

# LIMITATIONS

* This study was done on trained men. Beginners will notice better strength gains with more sets with the same intensity because doing more sets allows for more practice which is necessary for motor skill development. Motor skill development is not necessary in already trained men so if you are a beginner, please try to stick to the Recommended Routine which will make you do 3-5 sets per exercise.
* Doing just one set surely is not optimal if you are working on skills like handstands, front levers etc.
* This study was done on college-aged men. We do not know about the results for other age groups or other genders.
* This study was done in 8-12 rep range. We do not know what results would be seen in other rep ranges like 1-5 reps or 15+ reps.
* All sets were taken to failure. We do not know whether not taking sets to failure will yield similar results.
* We do not know what results we can expect from exercises other than the 2 exercises (bench press and back squat) used to test subjects in this study.
* This study was done for 8 weeks only. We do not know if this style of training has any long term benefits or not."
Update: 3.5 years of BWF (38/M),mildmildthoughts,510,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/17vhft1/update_35_years_of_bwf_38m/,1700009709.0,"Update: 3.5 years of BWF - M/38/5’10/150lb

Another six month update from a guy in his late 30's whose life was transformed by BWF. It's crazy to think that I've updated this sub every 6 months for the last 3.5 years but the number of people in their 30's and 40's that reach out makes me feel like it's worth continuing. 

[3.5 year progress update](https://postimg.cc/tn4yh8VV)

On the left I’m posed relaxed and then flexed. Also wanted to show some back gains in the top right and then some profile gains. Weight in may 2020 was 188, now 150. BWF and the RR has changed my life, physically, mentally, and socially. My head is clearer, my friend group has transformed, and I am more confident in my ability to do physical activities.

I still train 3 days a week, 80/20 clean vegetarian eating (no counting calories but I do try to hit at least 135g of protein a day). Unfortunately I frayed my rotator cuff and have been dealing with some bicep tendonitis so I’ve had to forgo working out at venice beach for a local gym. This was so that I can perform certain movements more safely. It’s been about 4 months since I was able to perform a push movement (no handstand, planche, dips, or push-ups) so I guess the HSPU goal will have to move to 2024.

Here are a few things that worked really well for me in the last six months:

* Hit abs first. The growth in my abs were immediately noticeable. I’ve always wanted a six pack and hitting abs first allowed me to prioritize that muscle group.
* 2 protein drinks before I snack. I snack at night, so my new rule is to drink two protein shakes (I use orgain plant protein drinks) before I snack on anything. No restrictions, just got to smash those shakes.

Hopefully this inspires some of you people in your 30’s and 40’s to get started. Day one or one day, the choice is yours and I’m here to help. PM’s are open :)

Here’s my current routine (based off the RR):

* 40lb dumbbell hanging leg raise
* explosive pull-up  x 20lb pistol squat
* close grip banded incline bench x hip thrusts
* front lever progressions
* YWT dumbbell exercise
* bicep exercises circuit (db and banded chin-up, hammer curl, ISO’s)

Supps:protein shake 6/weekPure protein bars: 6/weekcreatine 3-5x's/weekmultivitamin 4x's/week

No restrictive eating, no counting macros (just roughly counting protein), vegetarian diet, just BWF, one cardio or yoga class a week, raving every other weekend. Oh yea, not much of a drinker. I probably have 5-6 drinks/month."
"I interviewed Antranik, Matt Schifferle (Red Delta Project) and Adorian (Old School Calisthenics)",fp_admin,512,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/yicsmj/i_interviewed_antranik_matt_schifferle_red_delta/,1667224275.0," We talked a lot about how to stay consistent with your training over the long-term: looking for progress over hard work, getting the training intensity right, avoiding injury. Here’s some of what they said:

# Adorian

When I started working out again after stopping for a while, I didn't have big expectations about changing everything by tomorrow. I don’t set targets based on time, because progress is dependable on so many things, many of them outside of your control. I just knew I’d get there eventually.

As I started again, I said to myself, '*let's not do this because I'm frustrated and I want something. Let's do this because I enjoy it.'* It's not really about the fitness goals.

# Antranik

I will occasionally force myself to workout, but I genuinely have a passion for it. I wouldn’t keep working out over the long run if I didn’t. Find what you really enjoy in regards to working out to stay consistent.

For me, it could be strength training, for someone else it could be salsa dancing. It’s just important that we move, and having some different options means you don’t have just one tool you reach for every time.

I will often focus on just one goal for a few months, like the front lever. When I get bored of that, I’ll put it on maintenance and work on another skill, or focus on building size & strength. Trying to tackle 10 goals at once means you won’t get that far with any of them.

(thanks u/antranik)

# Matt Schifferle

When we don't understand what to do to improve at something, our default is to just work harder. Most of the time that just means doing more of what we're already doing, which probably isn’t going to be that effective. 

Hard work is not an asset, it’s a liability. Always look at the balance sheet to see how much spending your time and effort is actually improving things.

Because if you just focus on how hard you can work, it becomes an ego thing. But it doesn't make you tough, it doesn't make you productive, it doesn't get you what you want. If we put our attention on how do I just work harder, you're going to find ways to subconsciously beat yourself up.

I put a lot of time into making some shorter 'best of' videos of all of them together, you can [check one of them out here.](https://youtu.be/8r4wYsqyK_k) If you found the above text helpful I'd start there. Obviously all the full interviews are up online too:

What core exercises are used to strengthen athletes in gymnastics?,BrodyBrew,513,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gxk636/what_core_exercises_are_used_to_strengthen/,1591416971.0,I am wondering what core exercises do they use in gymnastics? For example I know front levers are a big part for core strength but what additional exercises are used?
"Could I do pullups, pushups, and squats everyday?",JohnJamesGutib,510,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cz5eyp/could_i_do_pullups_pushups_and_squats_everyday/,1567520000.0,"Now, before the generic title gets you all riled up, OF COURSE while building up strength and endurance I'll be following the standard routine - 48 to 72 hours of rest, caloric surplus, lots of protein, high quality sleep, progressive overload, splits, the works.

THAT BEING SAID, I'd like to pose a weird hypothetical, and I could really use the combined expertise of Reddit to solve this for me.

So, suppose I've reached my pinnacle fitness goal - I'm capable of doing 12 pullups, pushups, and squats right after each other, at a brisk pace, 5 sets, 90 seconds rest in between each set.

Assuming I'm not interested in getting any stronger or fitter anymore at that point (no more progressive overload), could I just do that routine every single day for the rest of my life until I die, as some sort of strength/cardio all in one routine? My primary concern would be overuse injuries - since there's no rest days, I could potentially injure myself, especially as I get older?

And if my assumption is correct that it's not really feasible to do that everyday even if it is just a bodyweight routine, IS there a feasible amount of volume that'll allow me to do it everyday? Say, instead of 12x5, just do 8x3 or whereabouts?

OR, (and this would make me overjoyed) am I worried about nothing and I actually could (theoretically) do that everyday even into old age because it's just a bodyweight routine and with enough strength, it's low impact enough to be that sustainable?

Weird and long winded question, I know, but it's been bothering me for a while now and the answer to this question could dictate how I move forward with my goals. Looking forward to your discussion!"
Comprehensive Calisthenics Guide (1 month WIP),Bumbleborg56,504,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/odevte/comprehensive_calisthenics_guide_1_month_wip/,1625380567.0,"Hey yall, it's my first time posting here but I've been lurking for a bit and figured [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEY_h-tk1RJMR8eCuKXpX2ACnMPEDQy37j0BVeXQLZg/edit?usp=sharing) might help some fellow bodyweight peeps out. I've been working on it for about a month now and it's essentially a collection of \~ 200 calisthenics skills / progressions. Each skill entry includes:

* the general movement pattern (i.e. overhead pressing, core compression etc.)
   * useful for beginners who don't need to get stuck in the details
* recommended sets/reps range to reach before progressing to a new skill (eccentric, isometric, & concentric where applicable) (very subjective / subject to change based on your personal goals)
* some key ideas / form notes to keep in mind
* up to 5 modifiers / small progressions for each skill
* up to 3 recommended tutorial videos for each skill (usually quite short, wanna respect ya time)
* all the anatomical movements involved in performing each skill (e.g. elbow extension, knee flexion)
* all the muscles worked in each skill (broken down into 3 categories: main working muscles, assisting muscles, & stabilizer muscles / weak activation muscles)
   * these were determined using the Gray's Anatomy 41st edition textbook & roughly analyzing the biomechanics of each skill
   * I've only been doing calisthenics for \~ a year and a half now so many of these skills I've never attempted; I suspect some of the muscles I put down might be slightly off in certain cases (e.g. glutes activate instead of hamstrings) but I've double checked a large number of skills & the muscles used line-up pretty spot on with what's mentioned by knowledgeable content creators

The purpose of this guide is NOT to say that you need to know all of the information inside it nor is it to say that you need to know all the muscles involved in a movement to build a fucking awesome routine (see: RR). This was more-so just a neat passion project that allowed me to get a wayyyy better understanding of biomechanics & calisthenics progressions for the future. BUT, I think it could serve as a pretty handy pocket reference for form cues & what muscles you could potentially focus on with a mind-muscle connection during your training. It's also designed with the color coding such that you can create a filter in the spreadsheet which, for example, might show only skills where the obliques are a prime mover (i.e. colored blue) & then you could pick and choose one to put into a ab workout for your routine.

Overall I think it'll just be a neat tool some ppl could use to develop their routines & understand where they may be overworking certain muscles or underworking others by mistake, particularly intermediate folks. It still needs some work (mobility stuff in particular) so I'll definitely be posting more refined versions in the future if that would help ppl. I've left commenting on so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE feel free to call out anything you think seems off or if you have some knowledge/experience that I don't; I'll collect up any notes ppl make and incorporate them back into the guide to make it more accurate & informative for the future. Hope this can find some good use with you guys! Peace."
